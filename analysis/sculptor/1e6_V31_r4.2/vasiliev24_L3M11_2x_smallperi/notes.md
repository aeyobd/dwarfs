Model originating from a ~6sigma shift in Sculptor properties to acchieve MW pericentre of ~27 kpc. 
Despire the relatively extreme pericentre, the stellar component is only slightly affected. THe break radius is close to 2 kpc or about 1.5 degrees on the sky, potentially observablebut still ~ 3x larger than what is noted in J+24/S+23. All stars are bound and effectively no stars leave the break radius. Pertubations to Exponential profile are only visible past 10 orders of magnitude in surface density (besides slight increase in scale radius).


One caveat applying to all similar models is more interactions with the Milky Way are possible in the past. While this can disrupt the stellar component (which will converge towards a Plummer profile), there should be no noticible breaks in the density profile because this last interaction is phase mixed within the break radius. 

TODO: paint on exp2d_rs0.15 stars.
