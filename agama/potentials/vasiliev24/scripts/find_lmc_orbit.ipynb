    "    There are two (and a half) key ingredients for success.\n",
    "    The first \"half\" is a preliminary step to bring the velocity on the same scale as position,\n",
    "    by defining a suitable scaling factor \"tnorm\" with the dimension of time.\n",
    "    Then we construct an orthonormal basis in the scaled 6d phase space, which is rotated w.r.t.\n",
    "    (x, y, z, vx*tnorm, vy*tnorm, vz*tnorm) and instead aligns with the orbital tori, loosely speaking.\n",
    "    Namely, the 0th axis of the new basis points in the direction of motion (dx/dt, tnorm*dv/dt) at P0,\n",
    "    where the acceleration dv/dt is assumed to be created by the MW+LMC potentials (which is a sensible\n",
    "    approximation, but does not take into account dynamical friction, etc. - so that the actual motion\n",
    "    followed by the reference point P0 may slightly deviate from this direction).\n",
    "    Nevertheless, the hyperplane orthogonal to this 0th axis is likely crossed by all nearby orbits,\n",
    "    so the position in this fiducial hyperplane is a proxy of how much a given point P deviates from\n",
    "    the reference point P0 in space, and the displacement along the 0th axis describes its deviation\n",
    "    in time (positive when the point P is \"ahead\" of the reference point P0).\n",
    "    These steps alone define a linear transformation (rotation) of the phase space, so would not be\n",
    "    sufficient in the case of rapidly varying motions near the pericentre.\n",
    "    Therefore, a second key idea is that any point P in the rotated 6d phase space can be tracked back\n",
    "    the 5d hyperplane defined above, along a nonlinear trajectory. The intersection of this trajectory\n",

    "    the time offset between the points P and P' (positive if the point P is ahead of P').\n",
    "    To execute this nonlinear transformation, we need to know not only the point P, but the entire\n",
    "    trajectory of this point over some interval of time that crosses the fiducial hyperplane.\n",
    "    The transformation from the orbit to the nonlin-scaled point amounts to finding the moment of time\n",
