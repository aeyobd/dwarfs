# The luminosity density of both disks
# at (8.2, 0, 0) kpc is set to 0.056 Lsun,v/pc^3.
# To acchieve this solar density, scale surface density by a factor 0.0797559
# For the bulge, the central density is 80.81 Lsun,v/pc^3.
# The fraction between the thin and thick disk is 0.12

# Note that in code units, 1 Msun/pc^3 = 0.1.

# Here, I chose the gNFW dark halo model. The best fit parameters are
# 1. alpha_dm = -1.53 pm 0.12. The inner slope of the DM halo (= -gamma below)
# 2. f_dm = 0.86 pm 0.06. The fractional mass of DM within 8.2 kpc.
# 3. r_s = 16.8 pm 5.4. Scale radius of DM halo
# 4. q = 1.14 pm 0.21. DM halo flattining.
# 9. M/L = 0.30 pm 0.13. ML ratio of stellar components.

# For this model, then the disk scaling factor is
# 0.0056 / 0.077980 * 0.30 = 0.02154 pm 0.010 (thin, code units)
# likewise, the bulge factor is
# 8.081 * 0.3 = 2.4243 pm 1.044 (bulge, code units)

# Using this model, the stellar mass within 8.2 kpc is
# 1.3575340513970249 code units (bulge, thin, thick, gas),
# so give fdm, the DM mass is
# Mstar(8.2) * f / (1-f) = 6.403161
# for a density norm of 1, the enclosed mass is 10698.2594

# note that I excluded the gas mass of
