# Potentials 
My list of potentials for use in the simulations here.
The unit system is such that G=1, unit length is 1 kpc, and unit mass is 1e10 Msun.

see the notes document for more details. In general, AGAMA implements the potentials like how I write them in the notes as well, so should be straightforward.

## Errani & Pe√±arrubia (2020) potential
This one is the default.
