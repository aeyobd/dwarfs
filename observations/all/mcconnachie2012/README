Abstract:
    Positional, structural, and dynamical parameters for all dwarf
    galaxies in and around the Local Group are presented, and various
    aspects of our observational understanding of this volume-limited
    sample are discussed. Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance
    estimates reliably placing them within 3Mpc of the Sun are
    identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of
    environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the
    quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the
    numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It
    extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the
    next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic
    knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar
    populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming
    years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they
    will continue to provide the most detailed information available on
    numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic
    observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes,
    mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical
    characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and
    presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a
    convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the
    provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties
    affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW
    sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The
    morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is
    discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in
    the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling
    relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs
    are presented, and the origin of a possible "floor" in central surface
    brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at
    faint magnitudes is considered.

Note (1): Galactic subgroup as follows:
   MW = The Milky Way sub-group (in order of distance from the Milky Way);
  M31 = The M31 sub-group (in order of distance from M31);
 Rest = The rest of the Local Group and its neighbors (in order of distance from
        the barycenter of the Local Group).
Note (2): * = The original coordinates of NGC 4167 are coincident with the
              coordinates of NGC 4163, but Sulentic & Tifft
              (1973rncn.book.....S) note that NGC 4167 is "non-existent".
Note (3): The distinction between dwarf elliptical (dE) and dwarf spheroidal
          (dSph) is based solely on luminosity and is therefore somewhat
          arbitrary. Objects fainter than M_V_~18 are given a "d" (dwarf) prefix
          and are again somewhat arbitrary.
Note (4): For more details relating to the discoveries of the NGC/IC galaxies,
          the reader is referred to Steinicke (2010ocns.book.....S).

Note (5): Peculiarities on distance/velocity, as follows:
   : = uncertainty flag:
   b = Significant distance/velocity gradients;
   c = Corresponding to RC stars at 6<D<7kpc;
   d = Carbon stars;
   f = Red giant branch stars;
   k = Range in distance estimates from 750<~D<~950.
   l = Assumed to be at M31-M33 distance.
   m = Alternative value in Gallart et al. (2001AJ....121.2572G);
   p = Optical velocity suggests that Tucana is not associated with
       nearby HI cloud;
   r = Optical spectroscopy suggests that HRV~-70km/s; however, HI analysis
       by Bellazzini et al. (2011A&A...527A..58B) gives HRV~-25km/s.
       No clear reason for the discrepancy currently exists.
Note (6): These correspond to values derived by
     Schlegel et al. (1998ApJ...500..525S) from an all-sky COBE/DIRBE and
     IRAS/ISSA 100{mu}m map, at the coordinates of the centroid of each
     galaxy (see Section 3 for further explanations).
Note (7): All distance moduli are based on resolved stellar population
     analysis (generally Cepheid, RR Lyrae, or TRGB (tip of the red giant
     branch) measurements, but also horizontal branch level and
     main-sequence fitting). Note that many TRGB estimates do not include
     the formal uncertainty in the absolute magnitude of the TRGB
     (Bellazzini et al., 2001ApJ...556..635B, 2004A&A...424..199B; 
     Rizzi et al., 2007ApJ...661..815R).
Note (8): Flag on reference as follows:
   e = For reference (16), see their Figure 8 for an excellent summary;
   g = For reference (18), distance calculated using their LMC-SMC offset of
       0.51+/-0.03 for the adopted LMC distance modulus;
   h = For reference (23), also Bellazzini et al. (2002, Cat. J/AJ/124/3222),
       but note that these estimates are ~0.2 mag larger than some previous
       values;
   i = For reference (27), cf. Dolphin (2002MNRAS.332...91D), which also
       estimates distances by comparing real and model CMDs;
   j = For reference (37), note this estimate is ~0.2mag larger than some
       previous values;
   n = For reference (67), see Demers et al. (2006ApJ...636L..85D) for
       velocities of 110 C-stars;
   o = For reference (69), uncertainty due to intrinsic asymmetries is gas
       distribution, L. Young (2010, private communication);
   q = For reference (60), see also Begum et al. (2006MNRAS.365.1220B);
   s = For reference (81), distance calculated prior to realization that 
       HIZSS 3 was two systems, and will most likely correspond more closely
       to the more massive A system.
Note (9): For most Local Group galaxies, the velocity corresponds to the
     optical velocity of the galaxy. For some of the more distant galaxies,
     velocities are measured from HI.
Note (10): These are calculated by first assuming that the barycenter of
     the Local Group is located at the mid point of the vector connecting
     the MW and M31 (for an adopted M31 distance modulus of (m-M)_0_=24.47;
     McConnachie et al., 2005MNRAS.356..979M). See Section 3 for further
     explanations.

Note (11):
   h = Measurement of structural parameters complicated by presence of
       surrounding stream.
Note (12): In general, these have been corrected for foreground extinction
     (1but not internal extinction). See Section 4 for further explanations.
Note (13): Flags on magnitudes, ellipticities, as follows:
   : = Uncertainty flag;
   b = surface brightness measured within central 2*2deg;
   c = PA broadly aligned with the Galactic Plane;
   d = Distance-independent absolute magnitude estimate.
   e = surface brightness measured within projected radius of 0.8deg;
   f = B magnitude, corresponding to "standard fit" in Table 1 of
       Choi et al. (2002AJ....124..310C);
   g = B magnitude; see Table 1 of Geha et al. (2006, Cat. J/AJ/131/332).
   i = PA corresponds to "outer component"; {theta}_inner_=95{deg}.
   j = ellipticity corresponds to "outer component"; {epsilon}_inner_=0.4.
   k = magnitude converted from g, r;
   l = B magnitude.
Note (14): Where possible, I cite directly measured values, although in many
     cases (including in the original papers) this parameter is derived by
     normalizing the measured profile to the apparent magnitude.
Note (15): Derived from Column Vmag of this table by subtraction of the 
     distance modulus given in Table 2 (Column (m-M)).
Note (16): For systems that show a change in this quantity as a function of
     radius, a mean value has been estimated.
Note (17): Derived from Column Rad1 of this table assuming the distance
     modulus given in Table 2 (Column (m-M)).
Note (18): Derived using values from columns Vmag, Rad1, and Ell. In cases
     where no ellipticity is measured, I have assumed circular isophotes.

 130-304  A175  ---       Com4    Comments about masses and kinematics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note (19): Assuming a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 1.
Note (20): Generally based on multiple velocity measurements of individual
     (giant) stars, otherwise commented on in Column Com (last Column of
     this table). Note that a single value for the velocity dispersion is
     often insufficient to describe the dynamics of the galaxy (e.g.,
     multiple components and/or radial trends).
Note (21): Flag on sigma* as follows:
   c = Upper limit (uncorrected for binaries) and with a possible member star
       removed that otherwise boosts the dispersion to ~5.5km/s;
   j = Uncorrected for possible rotational signature.
Note (22): Where available, I quote the peak (observed) rotational velocity,
     otherwise the maximum observed rotational velocity. In general, I try
     to give the rotational velocity uncorrected for inclination or
     asymmetric drift, although it is sometimes unclear in the original
     papers whether these corrections have been applied. "N" ("N/A" in the
     original paper) indicates that a rotational signature has been looked
     for and none has been observed. Where only weak gradients in velocity
     are detected and/or the rotational signature is ambiguous, I comment
     on this in Column Com (last Column of the table). In most cases, it is
     probably safest to interpret the absence of a rotational signature as
     the absence of any rotation with a magnitude equal to or greater than
     the magnitude of the velocity dispersion.
Note (23): Here, I have scaled the values cited in the relevant papers to
     the distance given in Column Dist of Table 2. Where only an upper
     limit from a non-detection is available and that upper limit is small
     in comparison to the stellar mass, I give the HI mass as zero.
Note (24): Flag on Mass as follows:
   b = See Putman et al. (2004ApJ...603L..77P) for possible detection of gas
       in the Sagittarius stream;
   e = Ambiguous detection of two HI clouds offset from optical center that
       could belong to the Magellanic Stream or Sculptor Group;
   f = Ambiguous HI detection of cloud offset from optical center that could be
       Galactic HI emission.
   k = Calculated following Huchtmeier & Richter (1988A&A...203..237H)
Note (25): Note that the HI velocity dispersion is affected by local
     processes, such as heating due to star formation, and so caution is
     urged in interpreting these numbers. Note also that many galaxies are
     observed to contain multiple HI components.
Note (26): Flag on velocities as follows:
   : = uncertainty flag;
   d = sig.HI aries from 5 to 40km/s across face of SMC.
   g = Estimated from mean velocities of seven prominent HI clumps.
   i = v.HI shows an apparent north-south gradient of 20km/s
       due to two distinct HI clumps.
   N = a rotational signature has been looked for and none has been observed
       (value is "N/A" in the published table)

Note (27): Generally derived from observations of mostly evolved giants,
          otherwise commented on in Column Com (last Column of this table).
          See Section 6 for more details.
Note (28): Technique as follows:
         HRS = Direct high-resolution spectroscopy. This is the most
               well-accepted method of determining [Fe/H] for a given
               star (the strengths of iron lines can be measured directly).
   RGB color = Red giant branch color.
               Da Costa & Armandroff (1990AJ....100..162D) derive a
               relation between the mean color of RGB stars in globular
               clusters measured at MV=-3 and the mean stellar
               metallicity of the cluster.
               See Section 6 for more details.
  Isochrones = See Section 6 for more details.
 CMD fitting = The reader is referred to the many excellent papers on SFH
               analysis using resolved stellar populations for more
               details (e.g., Gallart et al., 2005ARA&A..43..387G;
               Tolstoy et al., 2009ARA&A..47..371T, and references
               therein). Here, age degeneracies will likely be much
               reduced since age information is available from elsewhere
               in the CMD (in particular the main-sequence turnoff region).
 Co-added LRS (CaT) = Calcium II triplet equivalent widths (low resolution
                      spectroscopy). See Section 6 for more details.
          LRS (CaT) = Calcium II triplet equivalent widths (low resolution
                      spectroscopy). See Section 6 for more details.

                      spectroscopy). See Section 6 for more details.
          MRS (CaT) = Calcium II triplet equivalent widths (moderate resolution
                      spectroscopy). See Section 6 for more details.
