# Abstract



# Introduction

Sculptor (Scl) is one of the first discovered dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way (Shapley 1938; only preceded by the SMC and LMC!). As a classical dwarf spheroidal, Scl is relatively bright and compact. 

Since the initial discovery of Scl, most authors have noted that Scl has a slight ellipticity ($0.36$), often attributed to tidal effects. However, this does not align with the absolute proper motion or orbital path of the galaxy. 

While Scl has a relatively large pericentre (greater than 50kpc), @sestito+2023a detect that the galaxy likely has an excess of stars in the outskirts (past about 60 arcminutes). This excess is perhaps one of the clearest indications that Scl may be affected by tides. Here, our goal is to determine if under a $\Lambda$ CMD paradigm with DM-only simulations, tidal effects of the Milky Way (or LMC) may indeed be consistent with these observations, or if these observations may reveal instead a extended stellar "halo" or second component of the galaxyâ€”illustrating a complex formation for the galaxy.

- dark matter loss
- little influence to stars
- smallest pericentre does not help





# Sculptor (LMC orbits)

As discussed in @battaglia+2022, Sculptor's orbit is strongly influenced by the presence of an LMC. Figure @fig:scl_lmc_orbit_effect, the addition of an LMC reduces Scl's pericentre with the MW and implies that Scl may be on its first infall with the MW, in contrast to the discussion above. Thus, the LMC has a critical impact on the evolution of Scl. Additionally, Scl passes rapidly but relatively close to the LMC in the past 100 Myr. 

We now consider 3 orbits under the L3M11 potential model from @vasiliev2024. We focus on this LMC potential as a lighter LMC or MW should only reduce tidal impacts and the recent orbit of Scl is minimally affected by the LMC potential.
