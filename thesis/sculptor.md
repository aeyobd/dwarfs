For the mass-to-light ratio, we use the values from @woo+2009. Note that we assume a scatter of 0.17 dex for the mass-to-light ratios as reported for mass uncertainties. @delosreyes+2024 also indicate that other methods for stellar mass-to-light ratios result in similar scatters and systematic biases. However these values are just approximate.

### Tidal effects

- dark matter loss
- little influence to stars
- smallest pericentre does not help





## Effects of the LMC



### Orbital effects

As discussed in @battaglia+2022, Sculptor's orbit is strongly influenced by the presence of an LMC. Figure @fig:scl_lmc_orbit_effect, the addition of an LMC reduces Scl's pericentre with the MW and implies that Scl may be on its first infall with the MW, in contrast to the discussion above. Thus, the LMC has a critical impact on the evolution of Scl. Additionally, Scl passes rapidly but relatively close to the LMC in the past 100 Myr. 



Finally, we also consider the influence of the large Milky Cloud on the orbits and evolution of Scl. We adopt the @vasiliev2024 multipole approximation of an N-body simulation of the LMC and MW. Their initial conditions are

- MW halo:
- MW bulge (static):
- MW disk (static):
- LMC halo:

We now consider 3 orbits under the L3M11 potential model from @vasiliev2024. We focus on this LMC potential as a lighter LMC or MW should only reduce tidal impacts and the recent orbit of Scl is minimally affected by the LMC potential.
