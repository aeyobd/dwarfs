# Orbits in alternative potentials

For brevity, we only show two potentials in the main text. Here, we consider orbits of Sculptor and Ursa Minor in a variety of other potentials, to test if the potential may affect our conclusions. We find that the choice of potential does not affect the recent tidal evolution of either galaxy.

In addition, we consider whether any other satellite may have had a close encounter with Sculptor or Ursa Minor.

# Alternative initial conditions

In this section, we explore additional simulations which test assumptions not varied in the main text: variations in the initial halo, variations in the halo concentration, variations in the

### Dark matter halo structure

We have good observational evidence for some dwarf galaxies to be cored. Even Sculptor has debated claims for having a core [e.g., @amorisco+zavala+deboer2014; @bredels+helmi2013; @battaglia+2008; @walker+2009a; @richardson+fairbairn2014; @agnello+evans2012]



Sculptor and Ursa Minor may also be highly elliptical in 3D [e.g., @an+koposov2022], especially given their projected shapes.
