While written by my hand, I cannot pretend that I alone created this work. I am ever thankful and greatly indebted to the multitude of people who have supported, inspired, and nurtured me as a human being. 

To my supervisor, Julio Navarro, for being the critical eye and guiding reason to this work. I will always approach research differently now.

To Raphaël, who has helped inspire and direct this project. To everyone who has helped provide me opportunities to share work, and share wonderful ideas with me. Isabel, Jens, Eduardo, Jorge, David, Justin, Eugene, Azi, José, and many others.

To Jax, who has been a support along the way, guiding my research methods and project. 

To all of my new friends I have made along the way. Ruxin, Aviv. To Pranav, Ted, Jono, Adrianne, Praneet, Will, Maeve, Ewoud, Anne, Anya, Shoshanah. To Akshara  and Simon for all your personal and professional advice. We have built a wonderful community of students in this department. To all the students who have since moved on and show what we may be: Bobby, Leo, Ryan, Katie, Fletcher, Ayden, Maheyer, Jess, Dhwani, Spencer, Mallory, Omar, Isaac, and Dasha. 

 And to my friends across UVic, Wyatt, Rosemary, Maggie. To the Linguistics extended family and team *adequate*.  Melody, Lily, Gillian, Stephen, Jamie, Chloë, Alyssa, Kyle, and Marcus. You are all wonderful human beings, cooks, and always a joy to spend time with.

To the land of Victoria, and its historical caretakers. To the waters and beautiful trees, the ocean waves, rocks and hills and jagged coastlines. To the rich, enveloping forests and rust-red arbutus tress, scraggly Garry oaks and Camus flowers. I could not imagine a more beautiful place to study and to always remind my place in the world.
