Dwarf galaxies host, in many ways, the most extreme galactic
environments in the universe. These little galaxies are typically
defined to be fainter than the LMC \citep[\(M_V \gtrsim -18\) or
similarly \(L \lesssim 10^9 L_\odot\),
e.g.,][]{hodge1971, mcconnachie2012}. As the smallest class of galaxies,
dwarfs are the most cosmologically numerous galaxies. Dwarf galaxies are
highly \emph{dark-matter dominated}, with mass to light ratios exceeding
100 to 1000 \(M_\odot/ L_\odot\). Because of their small total masses,
many dwarf galaxies are \emph{quenched}, with little to no recent star
formation. Their stellar populations are \emph{relics} from the early
universe, consisting of many of the oldest and most metal poor stars.
Understanding the properties of dwarf galaxies thus has implications
across astronomy, from cosmological structure formation on the smallest
scale to extremely metal-poor stellar populations to chemical evolution
to galactic dynamics. Of the classical dwarfs, the Sculptor and Ursa
Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies stand out with a more extended density
profile relative to an exponential, hinting at tidal effects. As a case
study in tidal effects and our understanding of dwarf galaxy formation
and evolution, we aim to understand the dynamical history of these
galaxies.

In this section, we first describe cosmological structure formation and
the role of dwarf galaxies. Then, we explore the observational history
of dwarf galaxies, the \emph{Gaia} telescope, open questions, and why
Sculptor and Ursa Minor stand out. We discuss idealized simulations,
tidal effects, break radii, and recent developments in tidal
simulations. Finally, we provide a roadmap to the thesis as a whole at
the end of this section.

\section{Cosmological context}\label{cosmological-context}

We only understand a tiny fraction of the universe's composition. The
leading theory of cosmology, \(\Lambda\)CDM (cold dark matter), posits
that the universe is composed of about 68\% dark energy (\(\Lambda\)),
27\% dark matter (DM), and 5\% regular baryons\footnote{Astronomers like
  to change definitions of words. \emph{Baryons} here means
  baryons+leptons, i.e.~any standard model massive fermion. The photon
  energy density is negligible today} \citep{planckcollaboration+2020}.
While the composition of dark matter and dark energy remains elusive, we
know their general properties. Dark energy causes the acceleration of
the expansion of the universe on large scales. We do not discuss dark
energy here---it does not substantially affect the local group today.
Dark matter, instead, makes up the vast majority of mass in galaxies.
Typically, galaxies have baryonic to dark matter ratios of between 1:5
to beyond 1:1000 for faint dwarf galaxies. In \(\Lambda\)CMD, dark
matter is assumed to only interact gravitationally, passing through
matter without effect (transparent to light, or \emph{dark}). Dark
matter is also \emph{cold}, i.e.~typical velocities much smaller than
the speed of light in the early universe. Implications of dark matter
properties range from cosmological structural formation, galaxy
structure, and galaxy interactions.

\subsection{Structure formation and dwarf
galaxies}\label{structure-formation-and-dwarf-galaxies}

The very early universe was almost featureless. Our earliest
observations of the universe stem from the cosmic microwave background
(CMB)---revealing a uniform, isotropic, near-perfect blackbody emission.
But tiny perturbations in the CMB, temperature fluctuations of 1 part in
10,000, became the seeds of large-scale cosmological structure. Governed
by cosmological expansion, gravitational collapse, and baryonic physics,
each perturbation grows into larger structures. Initially, baryonic
matter was coupled to radiation and resisted collapse. Dark matter, only
influenced by gravity instead, freely collapsed into the first
structures. Each self-gravitating overdensity of dark matter is known as
a \emph{halo}. After recombination, where electrons combined with atomic
nuclei to form atoms, baryons decoupled from radiation and fell into the
dark matter halos. The densest pockets of baryons later formed the first
stars and galaxies.

Dark matter halos, and their associated galaxies, rarely evolve in
isolation. Instead, structure formation is \emph{hierarchical}. Small
dark matter halos collapse first and hierarchically merge into
progressively larger halos
\citep[e.g.,][]{blumenthal+1984, white+rees1978, white+frenk1991}.
Structure formation happens on a wide range of scales. The largest
structures become the cosmic web---composed of voids, filaments, and
clusters---and the smallest structures directly observable host dwarf
galaxies. Hierarchical assembly is evident through the large scale
structure of the universe, remnants of past mergers within the milky
way, and tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and their streams around
nearby galaxies.

Small-scale structure formation is sensitive to deviations from
\(\Lambda\)CDM cosmology \citep[e.g.,][]{bechtol+2022}. Many alternative
models, such as warm dark matter or self-interacting dark matter, may
smooth out small-scale features and reduce the abundance of small halos
or change their structure \citep[e.g.,][]{lovell+2014}. Dwarf galaxies,
occupying the smallest dark matter halos, are promising windows into
small-scale cosmological features. Alternative dark matter properties
can influence dwarf galaxy abundance, formation, structure,, and tidal
evolution. The nearby dwarf galaxies of the local group, with detailed
observations, present a promising opportunity to understand the
evolution of these objects and test our understanding of cosmology. To
understand the evolution of these objects, we need to understand the
general predictions from \(\Lambda\)CDM for the properties of dwarf
galaxies.

\subsection{Typical structure of dark matter
halos}\label{typical-structure-of-dark-matter-halos}

In \(\Lambda\)CDM cosmological simulations, dark matter halos are
remarkably self-similar. In \citet{NFW1996, NFW1997}, hereafter NFW, the
authors observe that the spherical radial density profiles \(\rho(r)\)
are well described by a two-parameter law: \begin{equation}{
\rho/\rho_s= \frac{1}{(r/r_s)(1+r/r_s)^2},
}\end{equation} where \(r_s\) is a scale radius and \(\rho_s\) a scale
density . This profile has shown remarkable success in describing
\(\Lambda\)CMD halos across several orders of magnitude in mass. NFW
profiles are \emph{cuspy}, where the density continuously rises like
\(\rho \sim 1/r\) at small radii \(r \ll r_s\). The steepness of the
density profile increases at \(r \sim r_s\) and at large radii, the
density falls off like \(\rho \sim 1/r^3\). Fig.~\ref{fig:nfw_density}
shows an example of a NFW halo and a cored dark matter halo.

The total mass of an NFW profile diverges, so halos are commonly
characterized by an overdensity criterion. The virial mass, \(M_{200}\),
is defined as the mass within a region \(r_{200}\) containing a mean
enclosed density 200 times\footnote{From approximate analytic arguments
  about the mean density of a self-gravitating spherical collapse halo
  in an expanding universe, the expected virial overdensity is \ldots,
  commonly rounded to 200 (REFS).} the critical density of the universe:
\begin{equation}{
M_{200} =(4\pi/3) \ r_{200}^3\ 200\rho_{\rm crit}, \qquad {\rm where} \quad \rho_{\rm crit}(z) = 3H(z) / 8\pi G
}\end{equation} A standard second parameter is the halo concentration,
\(c=r_{200} / r_s\) describing how the characteristic size of the halo
compares to its virial radius. In this case, the scale density is a
function of \(c\) alone,
\(\rho_s = (200/3)\,\rho_{\rm crit} c^3 / [\log(1+c) - c/(1+c)]\)
\citep{NFW1996}. However, we characterize halos by their circular
velocity profiles. The circular velocity,
\(v_{\rm circ}(r) = \sqrt{G M(r) / r}\), reaches a maximum of
\(v_{\rm max}\) at radius \(r_{\rm max} = \alpha\,r_s\) where
\(\alpha\approx2.16258\). \(v_{\rm max}\) is related to both the total
halo mass and the observed line of sight velocity disperion, and
\(r_{\rm max}\) relates to the scale radius.

While an NFW profile has two free parameters (\(M_{200}\) and \(c\)),
these are not independent. Smaller dark matter halos often collapse
earlier, when the universe was denser. As a result, small subhalos tend
to be more concentrated \citep[e.g.,][]{NFW1997}. The relationship
between \(M_{200}\) and c, or the mass-concentration relation, how more
massive halos become less concentrated in a predictable way
\citep[e.g.,][]{bullock+2001, ludlow+2016}. The lower panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:smhm} illustrates the present-day mass-concentration
relation in terms of \(r_{\rm max}\) and \(v_{\rm max}\). While there is
a general trend in concentration with mass, the concentration values
still have substantial scatter. Other parameters such as the halo spin
or shape may add additional variability to present-day distribution of
halos, but this variation is typically expected to be small
\citep{navarro+2010, dicintio+2013, dutton+maccio2014}.

\subsection{Connecting dark matter to
stars}\label{connecting-dark-matter-to-stars}

Both cosmology and observations find fundamental relationships between
the dynamical or total mass and stellar masses of galaxies. A key
prediction of \(\Lambda\)CDM is the stellar mass halo mass relation,
describing the amount of stellar mass forms in a (sub)halo of a given
size. In particular, the SMHM relation grows especially steep in the
dwarf galaxy regime---many dwarf galaxies are formed in halos of similar
masses. Fig.~\ref{fig:smhm} shows the stellar mass versus
\(v_{\rm max}\) maximum circular velocity (proxy for halo mass) for
apostle dwarfs from \citet{fattahi+2018}. While there is some scatter,
the range of predicted \(v_{\rm max}\) is fairly narrow across
\(\sim 4\) decades in stellar mass. Because lower mass galaxies have
increasingly shallow potential wells, feedback becomes more effective
removing gas more quickly. In addition, re-ionization suppresses late
star formation in the faintest galaxies. Thus, if we know the initial
stellar mass of a dwarf galaxy, we also know, at some level, the
properties of its dark matter halo.

Several challenges complicate a simple SMHM trend including environment,
assembly history, and tidal effects. Additionally, the detailed physics
of galaxy formation can impact the SMHM relationship. By being closer to
a massive host, many dwarfs quench earlier, resulting in lower stellar
masses \citep[e.g.,][]{christensen+2024}. Additionally, the time of
formation (relative to reionization) can influence the resulting stellar
content \citep{kim+2024}. Finally, tides influence both the dark matter
and stellar mass but in different amounts \citep[e.g.,][]{PNM2008}.
Consequently, tides may reduce the halo mass more than the stellar mass,
adding additional scatter to the SMHM trend, particularly for low-mass
satellites \citep[e.g.,][]{fattahi+2018}. Understanding the effects of
tides on local group dwarf galaxies is essential to determining where
and how these galaxies formed in a cosmological context.

\section{Observational context}\label{observational-context}

Dwarf galaxies have long raised conundrums in theories of galaxy
formation. The discovery of Fornax and Sculptor in 1938
\citep{shapley1938}\footnote{technically, the LMC and SMC may be
  classified as dwarf galaxies, but these were likely always known to
  humans at southern latitudes.}, with no known analogues, already
presented such an enigma. Shapley presented these dwarfs as a new type
of \emph{stellar system} resembling the Magellanic clouds and globular
clusters but did not attempt to speculate on the exact nature. While
dwarf galaxies were quickly understood to be galaxies based on the
inferred luminosities and sizes, their nature and formation remained
unclear for decades \citep[e.g.,][]{hodge1971, gallagher+wyse1994}.

The earliest spectroscopic work hinted that dwarf galaxies may contain
substantial dark matter masses. From early determinations of the
velocity dispersion for Sculptor and Ursa Minor dSph
\citep[e.g.,][\citet{aaronson+olszewski1987}]{aaronson1983}, inferred
mass-to-light ratios were at least 10 times the expectation for globular
clusters. While only determined by a few stars initially, these values
have solidified with time with larger and more precise samples
\citep[e.g.,][]{hargreaves+1994}. Subsequently, several theories
attempting to understand the formation and observed properties of these
objects were proposed. Examples include: dwarf galaxies are undergoing
tidal dissolution resulting in extreme mass-to-light ratios
\citep[e.g.,][]{kuhn+miller1989}, presence of massive central black
holes \citep[e.g.,][]{strobel+lake1994}, the formation of dark matter
free out-of-equilibrium ``tidal dwarfs'' from past mergers
\citep[e.g.,][\citet{kroupa1997}]{lynden-bell1982}, or modified theories
of gravity \citep{milgrom1995}. However, consistency with CDM galaxy
formation was also not out of the question
\citep[e.g.,][]{dekel+silk1986}. Since then, we have known that dwarf
galaxies are among the darkest objects in the universe, and
understanding their properties is critical to understanding the
universe.

Dwarf galaxies span a large range of physical sizes, luminosities, and
morphologies. Broadly, there are three classes of dwarf galaxies based
on luminosity, as illustrated by Fig.~\ref{fig:galaxy_images}. Local
\textbf{bright dwarfs galaxies} with magnitudes
\(-18 \lesssim M_V \lesssim  -14\), often exhibit irregular morphologies
and recent star formation. Fig.~\ref{fig:galaxy_images} shows the LMC as
an example of an irregular (and slightly bright) dwarf galaxy displaying
a bar. \textbf{Classical dwarf} galaxies occupy intermediate
luminosities ( \(-14 \lesssim M_V  \lesssim -7.7\)). Typically, these
systems are old, gas-poor, and spheroidal. All Milky Way satellites
discovered before digital sky surveys are classicals. The 12 classical
dwarfs satellites of our galaxy are Sagittarius, Fornax, Leo I,
Sculptor, Antlia II, Leo II, Carina, Draco, Ursa Minor, Canes Venatici
I, Sextans I, and Crater II.\footnote{While formally the dwarf galaxy
  names we discuss contain'' dwarf spheroidal'' (dSph), e.g.~Sculptor
  dSph, we omit this suffix for brevity.} The \textbf{ultra-faint}s
occupy the very faintest magnitudes (\(-7.7 \lesssim M_V\)). These
galaxies have minuscule stellar masses, tend to be more compact, and are
the darkest known galaxies. Altogether, dwarf galaxies span about 7
orders of magnitude in stellar mass.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The era of
\emph{Gaia}}{The era of Gaia}}\label{the-era-of-gaia}

A star's or galaxy's position and velocity are fundamental quantities
for understanding its orbit and origin. Unfortunately, determining
distances and full 3D velocities is challenging. The most direct
measurement of distance, parallax, requires precise tracking of a star's
sky position across a year. And while line-of-sight (LOS) velocities are
easily determined from spectroscopy, tangental velocities, derived from
proper motions, are much more challenging. Typically, measuring proper
motions requires accurate (much less than arcsecond) determinations of
small changes in a star's position over baselines of several years to
decades. The full 6D position and velocity information for stars was
historically only known for a handful of stars.

\emph{Gaia} has redefined astrometry, providing photometry, positions,
proper motions, and parallaxes for over 1 billion stars
\citep{gaialcollaboration+2021}. Launched in 2013, \emph{Gaia} is a
space-based, all-sky survey telescope situated at the Sun-Earth L2
Lagrange point \citep{gaiacollaboration+2016}. While \emph{Gaia}
completed its space-based mission in 2025, two forthcoming data releases
remain. Determining absolute parallax measurement is facilitated by the
observation that stars in different regions of the sky are affected by
parallax motion with different phases. By imagining two regions
separated by 106.5 degrees on the same focal plane, \emph{Gaia} measures
tiny changes in relative positions of stars across small and large
angles. Combining measurements from multiple epochs across several
years, an absolute all-sky reference frame is derived from which
parallax and proper motions are derived \citep{gaiacollaboration+2016}.
In addition to astrometry, \emph{Gaia} measures photometry in the wide
\emph{G} band (330-1050nm) and colours from the blue photometer (BP,
330-680 nm) and red photometer (RP, 640-1050 nm). \emph{Gaia}
additionally provides low resolution BP-RP spectra and radial velocity
measurements of bright stars (\emph{Gaia} radial velocity magnitudes
\textless16) \citep{gaiacollaboration+2016}. For this work,
\emph{Gaia}'s most relevant measurement are \(G\) magnitude,
\(G_{\rm BP} - G_{\rm RP}\) colour, \((\alpha, \delta)\) position, and
\((\mu_{\alpha*}, \mu_\delta)\) proper motions.\footnote{The proper
  motions \(\mu_\alpha\) and \(\mu_\delta\) are the apparent rates of
  change in right ascension \(\alpha\) and declination \(\delta\),
  typically in units of mili-arcsecond (mas) per year. \(\mu_{\alpha*}\)
  allows where \(\mu_{\alpha*} = \mu_\alpha \cos \delta\) corrects for
  projection effects in \(\alpha\).}

\emph{Gaia} has revolutionized many fields of astronomy including the
Milky Way and the Local Group. For example, 6D kinematic classification
of Milky Way stars has lead to the discovery of past mergers or Milky
Way building blocks like \emph{Gaia}-sausage Enceladus
\citep[e.g.,][]{helmi+2018}, out-of-equilibrium structures like the
\emph{Gaia} snail {[}e.g., \citet{antoja+2018l}, and dynamical effects
of the Milky Way's spiral arms and the bar in the solar neighbourhood
\citep{hunt+vasiliev2025}. Moving to the Milky Way halo, \emph{Gaia} has
helped find and constrain numerous stellar streams
\citep{bonaca+price-whelan2025}. Altogether, \emph{Gaia} has revealed
the hierarchical formation and complex, evolving structure of our own
galaxy.

For Milky Way satellites, \emph{Gaia} has enabled well-constrained
orbital analysis and facilitated precise stellar membership
determination. Before, proper motions of dwarf galaxies were spase or
undetermined. Few galaxies had precisely measured proper motions, often
from Hubble Space Telescope observations \citep[e.g.,][]{sohn+2017}.
\emph{Gaia} allowed for the first systematic determinations of Milky Way
satellite proper motions, and of unprecedented precision
\citep{MV2020a, pace+li2019}. While the proper motion uncertainty on a
typical dwarf member star is often with large uncertainties, by
combining the proper motions for 100s to 1000s of stars in \emph{Gaia},
incredibly precise proper motion measurements can be determined,
sometimes only limited by \emph{Gaia}'s systematic error floor
\citep[e.g.,][]{MV2020a}. Proper motions have ushered in a new dynamical
era for MW satellites studies, where we often have precise
determinations of the dwarf galaxy's recent orbit under a given MW
potential. In addition, \emph{Gaia} helps seperate out contaiminating MW
foreground stars. By measuring parallaxes or proper motions
significantly different from the dwarf galaxy, many stars can be
immediately removed as non-members
\citep[e.g.,][\citet{jensen2024}]{battaglia+2022}.

\subsection{Dwarf galaxies today}\label{dwarf-galaxies-today}

Today, we know the Milky Way system is teeming with satellites.
Fig.~\ref{fig:mw_satellite_system} shows the MW satellite system,
including dwarf galaxies, ambiguous systems, and globular clusters.
Advances in telescopes and observations has accelerated progress on the
nature of dwarf galaxy and introduced new questions. Deep digital
photometric surveys have more than quadrupled the number of known Milky
Way dwarf galaxies \citep{simon2019}. Upcoming and ongoing surveys, like
the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey for Space and Time, will
continue to probe fainter and fainter dwarf galaxies. In addition, large
aperture multi-object spectrographs have revealed the detailed and
complex inner chemodynamical structure of dwarf galaxies. Beyond precise
structural and kinematic properties of dwarf galaxies, modern
observations allow for the separation of multiple stellar populations,
detailed constraints on the dark matter density profiles, and hints of
tidal disruption or stellar halos.

Of local dwarfs, the classical systems still remain the best studied and
with most strongly constrained parameters. While extending 1-2 degrees
across the sky, making deriving properties trickier
\citep[e.g.,][]{mateo1998}, these dwarfs contain large numbers of bright
(giant) stars, allowing thousands of stars to be observed with deep
photometry and spectroscopy \citep[e.g.,][]{tolstoy+2023, pace+2020}. As
a result, the determination of fundamental properties such as the
position, size, orientation, distances, proper motions, line-of-sight
(LOS) velocities, and velocity dispersions \(\sigma_v\), are all
relatively well constrained and converged among different studies today.
However, ongoing research continues to redefine our understanding of the
detailed structure of Milky Way satellites, hinting that these objects
may be more complex than at first glance.

Observations of dwarf galaxies have been the origin of several disputes
or \emph{small-scale} problems in cosmology \citep[see
review][]{bullock+boylan-kolchin2017}. For example, the mismatch between
the expected number of dwarf galaxies from simulations and the observed
abundance was known as the \emph{missing satellites problem}.
Additionally, a number of observations showed that many dwarf galaxies,
but not all, possess dark matter ``cores'' as measured from circular
velocity curves \citep[e.g.,][]{moore1994, adams+2014, oh+2015} or dwarf
spheroidal \citep[albeit less constraining,
e.g.,][]{walker+penarrubia2011, read+walker+steger2019}. As a result,
numerous alternative forms of dark matter have been advocated as
solutions. \emph{Warm} dark matter, relativistic in the early universe
but cooler now, smooths out small-scale features and softens the cusps
of dark matter halos. \emph{Self-interacting} dark matter instead can
form cores but also the cores can collapse into a density peak.

However, these tensions have eased as a result of improved consideration
of baryonic physics. For instance, understanding observational
limitations and completeness has eased tension with the abundance of
dwarf galaxies \citep[e.g.,][]{kim+peter+hargis2018}. Also, recent
hydrodynamic simulations in particular have shown that strong feedback
can produce dark matter cores
\citep[e.g.,][]{tollet+2016, fitts+2017, orkney+2021}. Altogether, the
numerous past challenges for \(\Lambda\)CDM in the dwarf galaxy regime
illustrates the opportunity for dwarf galaxies to test the understanding
of galaxy formation and dark matter physics.

\subsection{Stellar density profiles}\label{stellar-density-profiles}

Surface density profiles efficiently characterize the shape of a galaxy.
At the most basic, fitting stellar densities provide properties such as
the shape, location, size, and orientation of a dwarf galaxy. However,
the details of a stellar density profile are essential for interpreting
the total mass of dwarf galaxies, their assembly and dynamical history,
and understanding correlations between dwarf galaxies
\citep[e.g.,][\citet{penarrubia+2009}, \citet{querci+2025},
\citet{lee+2018}]{herrmann+hunter+elmegreen2013}.

Four different surface density profiles are frequently applied to dwarf
galaxies: Exponential, Plummer, King, or Sérsic profiles
\citep[e.g.,][]{munoz+18}. The exponential profile is perhaps the
simplest, as a 1-parameter profile \begin{equation}{
\Sigma_{\rm exp} = \Sigma_0\exp(-R / R_s)
}\end{equation}

For a long time, exponential surface density profiles have been used as
a description for spiral galaxies {[}\citet{mateo1998}; discussion
below{]}.

To fit globular cluster density profiles, \citet{plummer1911} proposed a
1-parameter solution for a density polytrope\footnote{where density and
  pressure are assumed to be correlated}, \begin{equation}{
\Sigma_{\rm Plummer} = \frac{M}{\pi R_h^2}\frac{1}{(1 + (R/R_h)^2)^2},
}\end{equation}

where \(M\) is the total mass and \(R_h\) is the 2D half-light radius.
Now mostly superseded by the King profile for globular clusters, the
Plummer model is still a good fit to many dwarf spheroidals {[}e.g.,
moskowitz+walker2020{]}.

The \citet{king1962} profile, also an empirical fit to globular
clusters, is also often applied to dwarf galaxies, especially in older
literature. Using three parameters, a core radius \(R_c\), a truncation
radius \(R_t\), and a characteristic density, \(\Sigma_0\), the King
profile is \begin{equation}{
\Sigma_{\rm King} = \Sigma_0\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (R/R_c)^2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(R_t/R_c)^2}}\right).
}\end{equation}

In much of the older literature, \(R_t\) was often called and
interpreted as ``tidal radius'' as well, after the similar
interpretation for globular clusters
\citep[e.g.,][\citet{hodge1961}]{IH1995}.

Finally, the \citet{sersic1963} profile represents a generalization of
an exponential profile, and describes most galaxy light profiles well.
Typically parameterized in terms of a half-light radius \(R_h\), the
density at half-light radius \(\Sigma_h\) and a Sérsic index \(n\), the
profile's equation is \begin{equation}{
\Sigma_{\rm S\acute ersic} = \Sigma_0 \exp\left[-b_n \,  \left((R/R_h)^{1/n} - 1\right)\right]
}\end{equation} where \(b_n\) is a constant depending on \(n\). \(n=1\)
provides an exponential profile and \(n=4\) recovers
\citet{devaucouleurs1948}'s profile for elliptical galaxies. While a
Sérsic profile is not always used for dwarf galaxies, \citet{munoz+2018}
advocate for using the Sérsic profile since the added flexibility allows
for more profiles to be fit.

While there are not clear theoretical explanations why any profile is
best, the Exponential density profile is commonly assumed for dwarf
spheroidal galaxies. \citet{faber+lin1983} was one of the first to
demonstrate that an Exponential density profile is a reasonable
empirical fit to dwarf galaxies, theorizing that dwarf spheroidal evolve
from exponential disk galaxies and maintained a similar light profile.
Later, \citet{read+gilmore2005} showed that exponential profiles may
originate from general mass loss during the evolution of dwarf galaxies.
Many later photometric works for dwarf spheroidal galaxies apply
exponential fits, finding that exponential and king profiles both
provide good descriptions
\citetext{\citealp[\citet{mateo1998}]{binggeli+sandage+tarenghi1984}; \citealp{mcconnachie+irwin2006}; \citealp{cicuendez+2018}}.
As a result, many studies assume an exponential density profile for
dwarf galaxies in theoretical or observational modelling
\citetext{\citealp[e.g.,][
\citet{MV2020a}]{martin+2016}; \citealp{battaglia+2022}; \citealp[ but
is for disk]{kowalczyk+2013}}.

An exponential is far from the only density profile advocated for. Some
authors fitting Sérsic or King profiles (often in addition to
Exponential), find that the additional parameter somewhat improves fits
relative to an exponential
\citep{IH1995, vanzee+barton+skillman2004, munoz+2018, wang+2019}. Note
that the Sérsic indices are typically \(n \lesssim 1\), implying that
most galaxies tend to be an exponential or slightly steeper.

Beyond local group dwarf spheroidals, exponential densities appear to be
common, but sometimes with significant modifications. In particular,
many extragalactic dwarf Elliptical and blue compact / Irr galaxies
galaxies are fit well with an exponential + central cusp / nuclear
region \citep[\citet{noeske+2003}]{caldwell+bothun1987}. Contrastingly,
some studies find an inner deprivation of stellar material as compared
to exponentials \citep[e.g.,][]{caldwell+1992, makarov+2012}.

However, an exponential profile was often noted to not fit every dwarf
galaxy, particular for more distant dwarf galaxies. Even starting from
\citet{aparicio1997}, and \citet[for coma cluster
dE]{graham+guzman2003}, some people have noted deviations from this
simple empirical rule. Additionally, \citet{hunter+elmegreen};
\citet{herrmann+hunter+elmegreen2013};
\citet{herrmann+hunter+elmegreen2016}; \citet{lee+2018} note that at
least in a photometric sample of more distant dwarf disky/Irr/blue
compact dwarfs, that many or most dwarfs show two-part exponential
profiles. Irr do represent a substantially different class though so it
is unclear if these conclusions apply. \citet{caldwell+1992} mostly well
fit outer exponential, inner deviations photometric M31. Note that while
diversity is also commented on here, dwarf galaxies with outer
flattening profiles are often a minority in these studies.

Alternatively, \citet{moskowitz+walker2020}, use a plummer profile and
modified plummer profiles with steeper outer slopes (gamma=-8 vs -4).
For most galaxies, they do not have convincing statistical evidence to
prefer one model over another, but show that for 8 / 15 of dwarfs with
sufficient data, a plummer or steeper profile is preferred, with only
the stepper one ever strongly preferred.

Altogether, while there is some natural variation in the density
profiles of dwarf galaxies, an exponential is an excellent first-order
approximation. Typically, deviations from exponentials are in a
direction of steeper outer cutoff or changes to the inner slope of a
dwarf galaxy (due to a nuclear region/etc.). As such, deviations in
directions of density profiles becoming steeper in the very outer
regions are unusual. Explaining the origin, similarity, and diversity of
dwarf galaxy density profiles is a pressing question in our theories of
dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Irregardless of if all dwarf
galaxies are indeed exponential, there is nevertheless diversity
requiring interpretation in the density profiles of dwarf galaxies.

\subsection{Sculptor and Ursa Minor: Hints of tidal
signatures?}\label{sculptor-and-ursa-minor-hints-of-tidal-signatures}

Sculptor and Ursa Minor may appear to be typical dwarf galaxies at first
glance. Tables~\ref{tbl:scl_obs_props}, \ref{tbl:umi_obs_props} describe
the present-day properties of each galaxy. Indeed, Sculptor as the first
discovered dwarf galaxy, is often described as a ``prototypical'' dSph.
However, both galaxies have a long history of speculation that they may
be influenced by the Milky Way's gravity (see discussion). With
\emph{Gaia} data and spectroscopic followup, the detection of a density
excess has become more unmistakable. Using \citet{jensen+2024}'s
algorithm (described briefly below), \citet{sestito+2023a};
\citet{sestito+2023b} report that a ``kink'' in the density profile,
beginning around 30 arcmin for both Sculptor and Ursa Minor. They
spectroscopically followup some of the most distant stars, finding
multiple members between 6-12 half-light radii from the centre of each
dwarf (REF fig.~XXX). If dwarfs initially begin with exponential
profiles like Fornax, then these stars should be much rarer.

Perhaps the most straighforward explanation for the density profiles of
Sculptor and Ursa Minor are tidal interactions. \citet{sestito+2023a};
\citet{sestito+2023b} conclude that tides are likely the explanation.
Fig.~\ref{fig:scl_umi_fnx_vs_penarrubia} reproduces their comparison,
showing that Sculptor and Ursa Minor's density profiles deviate
substantially from fornax's in the outskirts, and are well-described by
the tidal model from \citet{PNM2008}. Our goal is to determine, assuming
\(\Lambda\)CMD, if the effects of the Milky Way (or other satellites)
may indeed create observable tidal signatures in these galaxies. If
tides cannot explain these features, Sculptor and Ursa Minor may instead
contain a extended stellar ``halo'' or second component of the
galaxy---illustrating evidence of complex history or formation in each
galaxy and forcing formation models to confront a diversity of density
profiles in the local group.

\section{Simulating tidal effects}\label{simulating-tidal-effects}

Since the discovery of dwarf galaxies, a large body of work has either
considered or simulated tidal effects. While pre-\emph{Gaia} work often
did not know the specific orbits of dwarf galaxies, the theory of tidal
mass loss remains largely the same.

Simulating dwarf galaxies accurately in a cosmological context remains a
substantial challenge. Currently, Cosmological simulations can predict
the overall abundance of larger mass dwarf galaxies {[}e.g., {]} and
broadly predict effects of tides \citep[e.g.,][]{riley+2024}. But, dwarf
galaxies are often near the resolution limit. Insufficient resolution
can lead to artificial disruption of dwarf galaxies and overestimation
of tidal effects \citep[e.g.,][]{santos-santos+2024}. For example, the
highest resolution cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-size dark
matter halo, the Aquarius project \citep{springel+2008}, achieved a DM
resolution of \(1.712 \times10^3 \Mo\), enough to barely resolve
Sculptor like halos (see Section~\ref{sec:Methods}). To address this
challenge, idealized simulations only simulate a single subhalo in an
approximate host potential. As a result, idealized simulations can reach
excellent numerical convergence at the cost of realism. For instance,
our simulations later are about 3x higher resolution than Aquarius but
with a fraction of the computational cost (400x less particles).
Idealized simulations make numerous simplifications: neglecting mergers,
cosmological context and evolution, mass assembly, and often baryonic
physics. We use idealized simulations here which are more powerful in
accurately assessing tidal effects after infall, given that the
idealizations do not impact these galaxies's recent history too much. As
such, a long history of work has resolved to understand the tidal
evolution of dwarf galaxies using these \emph{idealized} simulations.

Some of the earliest theory work on tidal mass loss of dwarf galaxies
originate from \citet{oh+lin+aarseth1995}; \citet{piatek+pryor1995};
\citet{moore+davis1994}; \citet{johnston+spergel+hernquist1995}.
Already, these works used similar techniques as we continue to use today
and laid the foundation for understanding tidal effects. While the
detailed assumptions have evolved (e.g.~assumed total mass of dwarf
galaxies and evolving beyond \citet{king1966} stellar), many of their
conclusions still hold true. More recent works expanding this theory
include \citet{read+2006}; \citet{bullock+johnston2005};
\citet{PNM2008}; \citet{penarrubia+2009}; \citet{klimentowski+2009};
\citet{errani+2023a}; \citet{fattahi+2018}; \citet{stucker+2023};
\citet{wang+2017}.

With precise orbits and a better understanding of the Milky Way
potential and system, more recent work began to directly probe the
dynamical histories of individual dwarf galaxies (although early work
began this for Sagittarius / etc). Examples include \citet{iorio+2019}
for Sculptor, \citet{borukhovetskaya+2022}; \citet{dicintio+2024} for
Fornax; \citet{borukhovetskaya+2022a} for Antlia II. Our goal is to
apply a similar framework to Sculptor and Ursa Minor.

\subsection{Simulating large gravitational systems: The N-body
method}\label{simulating-large-gravitational-systems-the-n-body-method}

Modelling gravitational evolution is essential for understanding
properties of galaxies. Perhaps the simplest method to compute the
evolution of dark matter is through \emph{N-body simulations}. A dark
matter halo is represented as a large number of dark matter particles
(bodies). Each body represents a monte-carlo sample from the underlying
matter distribution. However, galaxies are often assumed to be
\emph{collisionless}---particles are not strongly affected by
small-scale gravitational encounters. In contrast, star clusters evolve
differently as star-star gravitational collisions changes the dynamics
of the system. While we use individual gravitating bodies in N-body
simulations, the Newtonian gravitational force is softened to be a
Plummer sphere, so encounters closer than a softening length do not
substantially impact the dynamical evolution.

Naively, the newtonian gravitational force requires adding together the
forces from each particle at each particle, causing a computational cost
that scales quadratically with the number of particles, or \(O(N^2)\).
With this method, simulating a large number of particles, such as
10\^{}6, would require about 10\^{}12 force evaluations at each time
step, making cosmological and high-resolution studies unfeasible.
However, only long-range gravitational interactions tend to be important
for CMD, so we can utilize the \emph{tree method} to compute the
gravitational force vastly more efficiently.

The first gravitational tree code was introduced in
\citet{barnes+hut1986}, and is still in use today. We utilize the
massively parallel code \emph{Gadget 4} \citep{gadget4}. Particles are
spatially split into an \emph{octotree}. The tree construction stars
with one large node, a box containing all of the particles. If there is
more than one particle in a box/node , the box is then divided into 8
more nodes (halving the side length in each dimension) and this step is
repeated until each node only contains 1 particle. With this
heirarchichal organization, if a particle is sufficiently far away from
a node, then the force is well approximated by the force from the centre
of mass of the node. As such, each force calculation only requires a
walk through the tree, only descending farther into the tree as
necessary to retain accuracy. The total force calculations reduce from
\(O(N^2)\) to \(O(N\,\log N)\), representing orders of magnitude
speedup. Modern codes such as \emph{Gadget} utilize other performance
tricks, such as splitting particles across many supercomputer nodes,
efficient memory storage, adaptive time stepping, and parallel file
writing to retain fast performance for large scale simulations, forming
the foundation for many cosmological simulation codes.

\subsection{Break and tidal radii}\label{sec:break_radii}

Analytic approximations are powerful tools to generally determine the
influence of tides given a dwarf galaxy and a host. A variety of ``tidal
radii'' exist in the literature, we focus on two simple forms, the
Jacobi radius and the break radius.

The \textbf{Jacobi radius} represents the approximate radius where stars
become unbound for a galaxy in a circular orbit around a host galaxy.
Calculated from an approximation of the location of the L1 and L2
lagrange points, the Jacobi radius is where the mean density of the
dwarf galaxy is three times the mean interior density of the host galaxy
at pericentre, or \begin{equation}{
3\bar \rho_{\rm MW}(r_{\rm peri}) = \bar \rho_{\rm dwarf}(r_J).
}\end{equation} If \(r_J\) occurs within the visible extent of a galaxy,
we should expect to find unbound, \emph{extratidal} stars. While most
valid for circular orbits, assuming \(r_{\rm peri}\) for the host-dwarf
distance works as most stars are lost near pericentre.

We use the \textbf{break radius} as defined in \citet{penarrubia+2009},
marking where the galaxy is still in disequilibrium. The break radius
\(r_{\rm break}\) is proportional to the velocity dispersion
\(\sigma_v\) and time since pericentre \(\Delta t\), \begin{equation}{
r_{\rm break} = C\,\sigma_{v}\,\Delta t
}\end{equation} where the scaling constant \(C \approx 0.55\) is a fit.
\(r_{\rm break}\) describes where the dynamical timescale is longer than
the time since the perturbation, i.e.~the radius within which the galaxy
should have dynamically relaxed. As illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:toy_profiles}, for an idealized model with exponential
stars in a NFW halo, after some time past pericentre, the stellar
component is smooth but contains a change in slope around
\(r_{\rm break}\), where the radial velocities of the stars becomes
positive as they still readjust to a new equilibrium.

\begin{figure}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{figures/idealized_break_radius.pdf}}
\caption[Break radius validation]{The break radius of the simulations is
set by the time since pericentre. The initial conditions are
Sculptor-like, exponential stars embedded in NFW, evolved in
\citet{EP2020} potential with a pericentre of 15 kpc and apocentre of
100 kpc. In this model, the jacobi radius is close to the break radius.
See Section~\ref{sec:methods} for a description of our simulation
setup.}\label{fig:idealized_break_radius}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tidal evolution}\label{tidal-evolution}

While the break and jacobi radii help with understanding when tidal
effects matter, we still need to know what these effects do and how a
galaxy evolves.

As a galaxy evolves in a tidal field, several changes happen:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Mass is lost}. In particular, particles and stars on weakly
  bound orbits are most likely to be removed by tides.
\item
  \emph{Steams form}. If tides are strong enough, unbound mass becomes
  part of tidal tails, evolving along a similar orbit but leading or
  trailing the galaxy.
\item
  \emph{Mass redistributes}. Bound mass of the galaxy redistributes. As
  mentioned in the last section, this is visible as a wave of outward
  moving material, with the outermost material reaching equilibrium
  last.
\item
  \emph{A new equilibrium}. With mass loss, the gravitational potential
  decreases, resulting in a more compact dark matter halo and stars
  which adiobadically expand to a larger scale radius.
\end{enumerate}

Assuming that galaxies are spherical, isotropic, and evolve in a
constant tidal field, most dwarf galaxies should evolve along similar
tidal tracks. \citet{EN2021} derive tidal tracks for dwarf galaxies,
showing that NFW halos all evolve along a similar trajectory in terms of
\(r_{\rm max}\) and \(v_{\rm max}\).

\begin{equation}{
\frac{v_{\rm max}}{v_{\rm max, 0}} = 
2^\alpha 
\left(\frac{r_{\rm max}}{r_{\rm max, 0}}\right)^{\beta}\left[1 + \left(r_{\rm max} / r_{\rm max, 0}\right)^2\right]^{-\beta}
}\end{equation} where \(\alpha=0.4\), \(\beta=0.65\) are empirical fits.
As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:tidal_tracks}, this formula works for
both circular and elliptical orbits and is independent of the initial
subhalo size or distance to the host.

\section{Thesis outline}\label{thesis-outline}

In this thesis, our goal is to review the evidence for an extended
density profile in Ursa Minor and Sculptor, to assess the impact of
tidal effects on each galaxy, and to discuss possible interpretations
for the structure of these galaxies.

In chapter 2, we describe how we compute observational density profiles
from \citet{jensen+2024}. In chapter 3, we review our simulation
methods. Next, we present our results for the tidal effects on Sculptor
and Ursa Minor in Chapter 4. We discuss our results, limitations, and
implications in Chapter 5. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes this work and
discuss future directions for similar work and the field of dwarf
galaxies.
