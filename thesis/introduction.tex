Dwarf galaxies host, in many ways, the most extreme galactic
environments in the universe. These little galaxies are typically
defined to fainter than the LMC or SMC \citep[\(M_V \gtrsim -18\) ,
e.g.,][]{hodge1971, mcconnachie2012}. As the smallest class of galaxies,
dwarfs are the most numerous galaxies. Dwarf galaxies are highly
\emph{dark-matter dominated}, with mass to light ratios sometimes
exceeding 100 to 1000 \(M_\odot/ L_\odot\). Because of their small total
masses, many dwarf galaxies are \emph{quenched}, with little to no
recent star formation. Their stellar populations are \emph{relics} from
the early universe, consisting of many of the oldest and most metal poor
stars. Understanding the properties of dwarf galaxies thus has
implications across astronomy, from cosmological structure formation on
the smallest scale to extremely metal-poor stellar populations to
chemical evolution to galactic dynamics. Of the classical dwarfs, the
Sculptor and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies stand out with a more
extended density profile relative to an exponential, hinting at tidal
effects. As a case study in tidal effects and our understanding of dwarf
galaxy formation and evolution, we aim to understand the dynamical
history of these galaxies.

In this section, we first describe cosmological structure formation and
the role of dwarf galaxies. Then, we explore the observational history
of dwarf galaxies, the \emph{Gaia} telescope, open questions, and why
Sculptor and Ursa Minor stand out. We discuss idealized simulations,
tidal effects, break radii, and recent developments in tidal
simulations. Finally, we provide a roadmap to the thesis as a whole at
the end of this section.

\section{Cosmological context}\label{cosmological-context}

We only understand a tiny fraction of the composition of the universe.
The leading theory of cosmology, \(\Lambda\)CDM (cold dark matter),
posits that the universe is composed of about 68\% dark energy
(\(\Lambda\)), 27\% dark matter (DM), and 5\% regular baryons\footnote{Astronomers
  like to change definitions of words. \emph{Baryons} here means
  baryons+leptons, i.e.~any standard model massive fermion. The photon
  energy density is negligible today} \citep{planckcollaboration+2020}.
While the composition of dark matter and dark energy remains elusive, we
know their general properties. Dark energy causes the acceleration of
the expansion of the universe on large scales. We do not discuss dark
energy here---it does not substantially affect the local group today.
Dark matter, instead, makes up the vast majority of mass in galaxies.
Typically, galaxies have baryonic to dark matter ratios of between 1:5
to beyond 1:1000 for faint dwarf galaxies. In \(\Lambda\)CMD, dark
matter is assumed to only interact gravitationally, passing through
matter without effect (transparent to light, or \emph{dark}). Dark
matter is also \emph{cold}, i.e.~typical velocities much smaller than
the speed of light in the early universe. Implications of dark matter
properties range from cosmological structural formation, galaxy
structure, and galaxy interactions.

\subsection{Structure formation and dwarf
galaxies}\label{structure-formation-and-dwarf-galaxies}

The very early universe was almost featureless. Our earliest
observations of the universe stem from the cosmic microwave background
(CMB)---revealing a uniform, isotropic, near-perfect blackbody emission.
But tiny perturbations in the CMB, temperature fluctuations of 1 part in
10,000, became the seeds of large-scale cosmological structure. Governed
by cosmological expansion, gravitational collapse, and baryonic physics,
each perturbation grows into larger structures. Initially, baryonic
matter was coupled to radiation and resisted collapse. Dark matter, only
influenced by gravity instead, freely collapsed into the first
structures. Each self-gravitating overdensity of dark matter is known as
a \emph{halo}. After recombination, where electrons combined with atomic
nuclei to form atoms, baryons decoupled from radiation and fell into the
dark matter halos. The densest pockets of baryons later formed the first
stars and galaxies.

Dark matter halos, and their associated galaxies, rarely evolve in
isolation. Instead, structure formation is \emph{hierarchical}. Small
dark matter halos collapse first and hierarchically merge into
progressively larger halos
\citep[e.g.,][]{blumenthal+1984, blumenthal+1986, white+rees1978, white+frenk1991, somerville+dave2015}.
Structure formation happens on a wide range of scales. The largest
structures become the cosmic web---composed of voids, filaments, and
clusters---and the smallest structures directly observable host dwarf
galaxies. Hierarchical assembly is evident through the large scale
structure of the universe, remnants of past mergers within the milky
way, and tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and their streams around
nearby galaxies.

Small-scale structure formation is sensitive to deviations from
\(\Lambda\)CDM cosmology \citep[e.g.,][]{bechtol+2022}. Many alternative
models, such as warm dark matter or self-interacting dark matter, may
smooth out small-scale features and reduce the abundance of small halos
or change their structure \citep[e.g.,][]{lovell+2014}. Dwarf galaxies,
occupying the smallest dark matter halos, are promising windows into
small-scale cosmological features. Alternative dark matter properties
can influence dwarf galaxy structure, formation, and tidal evolution.
The nearby dwarf galaxies of the local group, with detailed
observations, present a promising opportunity to understand the
evolution of these objects and test our understanding of cosmology. To
understand the evolution of these objects, we need to understand the
general predictions from \(\Lambda\)CDM for the properties of dwarf
galaxies.

\subsection{Typical structure of dark matter
halos}\label{typical-structure-of-dark-matter-halos}

In \(\Lambda\)CDM cosmological simulations, dark matter halos are
remarkably self-similar. In \citet{NFW1996, NFW1997}, hereafter NFW, the
authors observe that the spherical radial density profiles \(\rho(r)\)
are well described by a two-parameter law: \begin{equation}{
\rho/\rho_s= \frac{1}{(r/r_s)(1+r/r_s)^2},
}\end{equation} where \(r_s\) is a scale radius and \(\rho_s\) a scale
density . This profile has shown remarkable success in describing
\(\Lambda\)CMD halos across several orders of magnitude in mass. NFW
profiles are \emph{cuspy}, where the density continuously rises like
\(\rho \sim 1/r\) at small radii \(r \ll r_s\). The steepness of the
density profile increases at \(r \sim r_s\) and at large radii, the
density falls off like \(\rho \sim 1/r^3\). Fig.~\ref{fig:nfw_density}
shows an example of a NFW halo and a cored dark matter halo.

The total mass of an NFW profile diverges, so halos are commonly
characterized by an overdensity criterion. The virial mass, \(M_{200}\),
is defined as the mass within a region \(r_{200}\) containing a mean
enclosed density 200 times\footnote{200 smells like an arbitrary value.
  From approximate analytic arguments about the mean density of a
  self-gravitating spherical collapse halo in an expanding universe, the
  expected virial overdensity is XXX, rounding up to 200 (REFS).} the
critical density of the universe: \begin{equation}{
M_{200} =(4\pi/3) \ r_{200}^3\ 200\rho_{\rm crit}, \qquad {\rm where} \quad \rho_{\rm crit}(z) = 3H(z) / 8\pi G
}\end{equation} A standard second parameter is the halo concentration,
\(c=r_{200} / r_s\) describing how the characteristic size of the halo
compares to its virial radius. In this case, the scale density is a
function of \(c\) alone,
\(\rho_s = (200/3)\,\rho_{\rm crit} c^3 / [\log(1+c) - c/(1+c)]\)
\citep{NFW1996}. However, we characterize halos by their circular
velocity profiles. The circular velocity,
\(v_{\rm circ}(r) = \sqrt{G M(r) / r}\), reaches a maximum of
\(v_{\rm max}\) at radius \(r_{\rm max} = \alpha\,r_s\) where
\(\alpha\approx2.16258\). \(v_{\rm max}\) is related to both the total
halo mass and the observed line of sight velocity disperion, and
\(r_{\rm max}\) relates to the scale radius.

While an NFW profile has two free parameters (\(M_{200}\) and \(c\)),
these are not independent. Smaller dark matter halos often collapse
earlier, when the universe was denser. As a result, small subhalos tend
to be more concentrated \citep[e.g.,][]{NFW1997}. The relationship
between \(M_{200}\) and c, or the mass-concentration relation, how more
massive halos become less concentrated in a predictable way
\citep[e.g.,][]{bullock+2001, ludlow+2016}. While there is a general
trend in concentration with mass, the concentration values still have
substantial scatter. Other parameters such as the halo spin or shape or
slight changes in the halo density profile add additional variability to
the present-day distribution of halos \citep[see
e.g.,][darkEXP]{navarro+2010, dicintio+2013, dutton+maccio2014}.

\subsection{Connecting dark matter to
stars}\label{connecting-dark-matter-to-stars}

Both cosmology and observations find fundamental relationships between
properties of galaxies, particularly for the total mass and luminosity.
A key prediction of \(\Lambda\)CDM is the stellar mass halo mass
relation, describing the amount of stellar mass forms in a (sub)halo of
a given size. In particular, the SMHM relation grows especially steep in
the dwarf galaxy regime---many dwarf galaxies are formed in halos of
similar masses. Fig.~\ref{fig:smhm} shows the stellar mass versus
\(v_{\rm max}\) maximum circular velocity (proxy for halo mass) for
apostle dwarfs from \citet{fattahi+2018}. While there is some scatter,
the range of possible \(v_{\rm max}\) is fairly narrow across \(\sim 5\)
decades in stellar mass. Thus, if we know the initial stellar mass of a
dwarf galaxy, we also know, at some level, its dark matter mass.

Several challenges complicate a simple SMHM trend including environment,
assembly history, and tidal effects. By being closer to a massive host,
most dwarfs quench earlier, resulting in lower stellar masses
\citep[e.g.,][]{christensen+2024}. Additionally, the time of formation
(relative to reionization) can influence the resulting stellar content
\citep{kim+2024}. Finally, tides influence both the dark matter and
stellar mass but in different amounts \citep[e.g.,][]{PNM2008}.
Consequently, tides may reduce the halo mass more than the stellar mass,
adding additional scatter to the SMHM trend, particularly for Milky Way
satellites \citep[e.g.,][]{fattahi+2018}. Understanding the effects of
tides on local group dwarf galaxies is essential to determining where
and how these galaxies formed in a cosmological context.

\section{Observational context}\label{observational-context}

Dwarf galaxies have long challenged questioned theories of galaxy
formation. The first discovered dwarf galaxies in 1938\footnote{technically,
  the LMC and SMC may be classified as dwarf galaxies, but these were
  likely always known to humans at southern latitudes.}, Sculptor and
Fornax, already presented such a puzzle. Having no close analogues,
\citet{shapley1938} present Sculptor and Fornax as a new type of
\emph{stellar system} resembling the Magellanic clouds and globular
clusters, but not attempting to speculate on the exact nature. While
generally understood to be galaxies based on the inferred luminosities
and sizes, the nature and formation remained unclear
\citep[e.g.,][]{hodge1971}.

The earliest spectroscopic work hinted that dwarf galaxies may contain
substantial dark matter. From the first measurements of velocity
dispersions
\citep[e.g.,][]{aaronson1983, gallagher+wyse1994, pryor1996}, the
inferred mass-to-light ratios were about 10 times the expectation for
globular clusters \citep{matteo1998}. Subsequently, many theories
attempting to understand the formation and observed properties of these
objects were proposed. Examples included that dwarf galaxies were formed
tidally in the gas clouds of satellites; dwarf galaxies are undergoing
tidal dissolution resulting in extreme mass-to-light ratios
\citep[e.g.,][]{pryor1996}, or Since then, we have known that dwarf
galaxies are among the darkest objects in the universe, and
understanding their properties is critical to understanding the
universe.

Dwarf galaxies span a large range of physical sizes, luminosities, and
morphologies. Broadly, there are three classes of dwarf galaxies based
on luminosity, as illustrated by Fig.~\ref{fig:galaxy_images}. Local
\textbf{bright dwarfs galaxies} with magnitudes
\(-18 \lesssim M_V \lesssim  -14\), often exhibit irregular morphologies
and recent star formation. Fig.~\ref{fig:galaxy_images} shows the LMC as
an example of an irregular (and slightly bright) dwarf galaxy displaying
a bar. \textbf{Classical dwarf} galaxies occupy intermediate
luminosities ( \(-14 \lesssim M_V  \lesssim -7.7\)). Typically, these
systems are old, gas-poor, and spheroidal. All Milky Way satellites
discovered before digital sky surveys are classicals. The 12 classical
dwarfs satellites of our galaxy are Sagittarius, Fornax, Leo I,
Sculptor, Antlia II, Leo II, Carina, Draco, Ursa Minor, Canes Venatici
I, Sextans I, and Crater II.\footnote{While formally the dwarf galaxy
  names we discuss contain'' dwarf spheroidal'' (dSph), e.g.~Sculptor
  dSph, we omit this suffix for brevity.} The ultra-faints occupy the
very faintest magnitudes (\(-7.7 \lesssim M_V\)). These galaxies have
miniscule stellar masses, tend to be more compact, and are the darkest
known galaxies. An example is Boötes V as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:galaxy_images}. Altogether, dwarf galaxies span about 7
orders of magnitude in stellar mass.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The era of
\emph{Gaia}}{The era of Gaia}}\label{the-era-of-gaia}

A star's or galaxy's position and velocity are fundamental quantities
for understanding its orbit and origin. Unfortunately, determining
distances and full 3D velocities is challenging. The most direct
measurement of distance, parallax, requires precise tracking of a star's
sky position across a year. And while line-of-sight (LOS) velocities are
easily determined from spectroscopy, tangental velocities, derived from
proper motions, are much more challenging. Typically, measuring proper
motions requires accurate (much less than arcsecond) determinations of
small changes in a star's position over baselines of several years to
decades. The full 6D position and velocity information for stars was
historically only known for a handful of stars.

\emph{Gaia} has redefined astrometry, providing photometry, positions,
proper motions, and parallaxes for over 1 billion stars
\citep{gaialcollaboration+2021}. Launched in 2013, \emph{Gaia} is a
space-based, all-sky survey telescope situated at the Sun-Earth L2
Lagrange point \citep{gaiacollaboration+2016}. While \emph{Gaia}
completed its space-based mission in 2025, two forthcoming data releases
remain. Determining absolute parallax measurement is facilitated by the
observation that stars in different regions of the sky are affected by
parallax motion with different phases. By imagining two regions
separated by 106.5 degrees on the same focal plane, \emph{Gaia} measures
tiny changes in relative positions of stars across small and large
angles. Combining measurements from multiple epochs across several
years, an absolute all-sky reference frame is derived from which
parallax and proper motions are derived \citep{gaiacollaboration+2016}.
In addition to astrometry, \emph{Gaia} measures photometry in the wide
\emph{G} band (330-1050nm) and colours from the blue photometer (BP,
330-680 nm) and red photometer (RP, 640-1050 nm). \emph{Gaia}
additionally provides low resolution BP-RP spectra and radial velocity
measurements of bright stars (\emph{Gaia} radial velocity magnitudes
\textless16) \citep{gaiacollaboration+2016}. For this work,
\emph{Gaia}'s most relevant measurement are \(G\) magnitude,
\(G_{\rm BP} - G_{\rm RP}\) colour, \((\alpha, \delta)\) position, and
\((\mu_{\alpha*}, \mu_\delta)\) proper motions.\footnote{\(\mu_\alpha\)
  and \(\mu_\delta\) are the apparent changes in \(\alpha\) and
  \(\delta\). \(\mu_{\alpha*}\) allows where
  \(\mu_{\alpha*} = \mu_\alpha \cos \delta\) corrects for projection
  effects in \(\alpha\).}

\emph{Gaia} has revolutionized many fields of astronomy including the
Milky Way and the Local Group. For example, 6D kinematic classification
of Milky Way stars has lead to the discovery of past mergers or Milky
Way building blocks like \emph{Gaia}-sausage Enceladus
\citep[e.g.,][]{helmi+2018}, out-of-equilibrium structures like the
\emph{Gaia} snail {[}e.g., \citet{antoja+2018l}, and effects of the
Milky Way's bulge and bar \citep{hunt+vasiliev2025}. Moving to the Milky
Way halo, numerous streams \citep{bonaca+price-whelan2025}. \emph{Gaia}
has revealed the hierarchical formation and messy structure of our own
galaxy.

For Milky Way satellites, \emph{Gaia} has enabled well-constrained
orbital analysis and facilitated precise stellar membership
determination. Before, proper motions of dwarf galaxies were spase or
undetermined and measured by the Hubble Space Telescope or other methods
for only a few systems. \emph{Gaia} allowed for the first systematic
determinations of Milky Way satellite proper motions, and of
unprecedented precision \citep{MV2020a, pace+li2019}. While the proper
motion uncertainty on a typical dwarf member star is often with large
uncertainties, by combining the proper motions for 100s to 1000s of
stars in \emph{Gaia}, incredibly precise proper motion measurements can
be determined, sometimes only limited by \emph{Gaia}'s systematic error
floor \citep[e.g.,][]{MV2020a}. Proper motions have ushered in a new
dynamical era for MW satellites studies, where we often have precise
determinations of the dwarf galaxy's recent orbit under a given MW
potential. In addition, \emph{Gaia} helps seperate out contaiminating MW
foreground stars. By measuring parallaxes or proper motions
significantly different from the dwarf galaxy, many stars can be
immediately removed as non-members
\citep[e.g.,][\citet{jensen2024}]{battaglia+2022}.

\subsection{Dwarf galaxies today}\label{dwarf-galaxies-today}

Today, we know the Milky Way system is teeming with satellites.
Fig.~\ref{fig:mw_satellite_system} shows the MW satellite system,
including dwarf galaxies, ambiguous systems, and globular clusters.
Advances in telescopes and observations has accelerated progress on the
nature of dwarf galaxy and introduced new questions. Deep digital
photometric surveys have more than quadrupled the number of known Milky
Way dwarf galaxies \citep{simon2019}. Upcoming and ongoing surveys, like
the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey for Space and Time, will
continue to probe fainter and fainter dwarf galaxies. In addition, large
aperture multi-object spectrographs have revealed the detailed and
complex inner chemodynamical structure of dwarf galaxies. Beyond precise
structural and kinematic properties of dwarf galaxies, modern
observations allow for the separation of multiple stellar populations,
detailed constraints on the dark matter density profiles, and hints of
tidal disruption or stellar halos.

Of local dwarfs, the classical systems still remain the best studied and
with most strongly constrained parameters. While extending 1-2 degrees
across the sky, making deriving properties trickier
\citep[e.g.,][]{mateo1998}, these dwarfs contain large numbers of bright
(giant) stars, allowing thousands of stars to be observed with deep
photometry and spectroscopy \citep[e.g.,][]{tolstoy+2023, pace+2020}. As
a result, the determination of fundamental properties such as the
position, size, orientation, distances, proper motions, line-of-sight
(LOS) velocities, and velocity dispersions \(\sigma_v\), are all
relatively well constrained today and show excellent convergence among
different works. However, ongoing research continues to redefine our
understanding of the detailed structure of Milky Way satellites, hinting
that these objects may be more complex than at first glance.

Observations of dwarf galaxies have been the origin of several
\emph{small-scale} problems in cosmology
\citep[e.g.,][]{bullock+boylan-kolchin2017}. For example, the mismatch
between the expected number of dwarf galaxies from simulations and the
observed abundance was known as the \emph{missing satellites problem}.

\emph{Core Cusp Problem}. One of the open questions in dwarf galaxy
evolution is the formation of dark matter \emph{cores} where the density
becomes constant instead \(\rho \sim 1\). A leading theory is cores form
through of baryonic effects and feedback. If dark matter deviates from
\(\Lambda\)CDM, then the NFW density profile may not describe halos
anymore. \emph{Warm} dark matter, relativistic in the early universe but
cooler now, smooths out small-scale features and softens the cusps of
dark matter halos. \emph{Self-interacting} dark matter instead can form
cores but also the cores can collapse into a density peak.

Understanding the p

\subsection{Stellar density profiles}\label{stellar-density-profiles}

Surface density profiles efficiently characterize the shape of a galaxy.
At the most basic, fitting stellar densities provide properties such as
the shape, location, size, and orientation of a dwarf galaxy. However,
the details of a stellar density profile are essential for interpreting
the total mass of dwarf galaxies, their assembly and dynamical history,
and understanding correlations between dwarf galaxies (REFS).

Typically, three different surface density profiles are applied to dwarf
galaxies: Exponential, Plummer, or a King profile
\citep[e.g.,][]{munoz+18, cicuendez+2018}. The exponential profile is
perhaps the simplest, as a 1-parameter profile \begin{equation}{
\Sigma_{\rm exp} = \Sigma_0\exp(-R / R_s)
}\end{equation}

For a long time, exponential surface density profiles have been used as
an description for spiral galaxies (see discussion before).

To fit globular cluster density profiles, \citet{plummer1911} proposed a
1-parameter solution for a density polytrope\footnote{where density and
  pressure are assumed to be correlated}, \begin{equation}{
\Sigma_{\rm Plummer} = \frac{M}{\pi R_h^2}\frac{1}{(1 + (R/R_h)^2)^2},
}\end{equation}

where \(M\) is the total mass and \(R_h\) is the 2D half-light radius.
Now superceded by the King profile for globular clusters, the Plummer
model is still a good fit to dwarf spheroidals and XXX.

The \citet{king1962} profile, also an empirical fit to globular
clusters, is also commonly applied to . This density profile includes an
additional parameter \(R_t\), a truncation radius where the density
sharply drops to 0. \begin{equation}{
\Sigma_{\rm King} = \Sigma_0\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (R/R_c)^2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(R_t/R_c)^2}}\right)
}\end{equation}

Where \(R_c\) is the characteristic ``core'' radius and \(\Sigma_0\) is
a characteristic density related to the total mass.

Finally, the Sérsic profile represents a generalization of an
exponential profile, and describes galaxies of many kinds well.
Typically parameterized in terms of a half-light radius \(R_h\), the
density at half-light radius \(\Sigma_h\) and a Sérsic index \(n\), the
profile's equation is \begin{equation}{
\Sigma_{\rm Sérsic} = \Sigma_0 \exp\left[-b_n \,  \left((R/R_h)^{1/n} - 1\right)\right]
}\end{equation} where \(b_n\) is a constant depending on \(n\). Less
commonly used in studies of dwarf galaxies, \citet{munoz+2018} advocate
for using the Sérsic profile since the added flexibility allows for more
profiles to be fit.

While there are not clear theoretical explanations why any profile is
best, the Exponential stellar density profile is commonly assumed as a
single parameter density profile which fits many dwarf galaxies well
\citetext{\citealp[e.g.,][]{eskridge1988a}; \citealp{hodge1971a}; \citealp{hodge1991b}; \citealp{IH1995}; \citealp[
but with nuclear regions and only for Mb \textless{} -16
virgo]{binggeli+cameron1991}; \citealp{caldwell+bothun1987}; \citealp{simon+2005}}.

\citet{faber+lin1983} demonstrated that an Exponential density profile
is a reasonable empirical fit to dwarf galaxies, theorizing that dwarf
spheroidal evolve from exponential disks, maintaining a similar light
profile.

As a result, many studies assume an exponential density profile in
theoretical or observational modelling
\citep[e.g.,][]{MV2020a, kowalczyk+2013}.

\citet{lelli+2014} (example of using exponential.)

However, an exponential profile was often noted to not fit every dwarf
galaxy. Even starting from \citet{aparicio1997}, and \citet[for coma
cluster dE]{graham+guzman2003}, some people have noted deviations from
this simple empirical rule. Additionally, \citet{hunter+elmegreen};
\citet{herrmann+hunter+elmegreen2013};
\citet{herrmann+hunter+elmegreen2016} note that at least in a
photometric sample of more distant dwarf disky/Irr/blue compact dwarfs,
that many or most dwarfs show deviations from exponential profiles. Irr
do represent a substantially different class though so it is unclear if
these conclusions apply.

Interestingly, many works also show that differences between the
different density profiles remain barely significant for some galaxies
\citep[e.g.,][]{cicuendez+2018}. \citet{wang+2019} for Fornax showing
similar performance but favour Sérsic, \citet{mcconnachie+irwin2006} for
Exp, Plummer, King in other galaxies.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \citet{makarov+2012} isolated local volume dwarf galaxy with central
  deprivation compared to exponential, spheroidal
\item
  \citet{martin+2016}, exponential fits to many pandas dwarf galaxies
\item
  \citet{moskowitz+walker2020}, generalized plummer fits.
\end{itemize}

Irregardless of if all dwarf galaxies are indeed exponential, there is
nevertheless diversity requiring interpretation in the density profiles
of dwarf galaxies.

\subsection{Sculptor and Ursa Minor: Hints of tidal
signatures?}\label{sculptor-and-ursa-minor-hints-of-tidal-signatures}

Sculptor and Ursa Minor may appear to be typical dwarf galaxies at first
glance. Tables~\ref{tbl:scl_obs_props}, \ref{tbl:umi_obs_props} describe
the present-day properties of each galaxy. Indeed, Sculptor as the first
discovered dwarf galaxy, is often described as a ``prototypical'' dSph.
However, both galaxies have a long history of speculation that they may
be influenced by the Milky Way's gravity (see discussion). With
\emph{Gaia} data and spectroscopic followup, the detection of a density
excess has become more unmistakable. Using \citet{jensen+2024}'s
algorithm (described briefly below), \citet{sestito+2023a};
\citet{sestito+2023b} report that a ``kink'' in the density profile,
beginning around 30 arcmin for both Sculptor and Ursa Minor. They
spectroscopically followup some of the most distant stars, finding
multiple members between 6-12 half-light radii from the centre of each
dwarf (REF fig.~XXX). If dwarfs initially begin with exponential
profiles like Fornax, then these stars should be much rarer.

Perhaps the most straighforward explanation for the density profiles of
Sculptor and Ursa Minor are tidal interactions. \citet{sestito+2023a};
\citet{sestito+2023b} conclude that tides are likely the explanation.
Fig.~\ref{fig:scl_umi_fnx_vs_penarrubia} reproduces their comparison,
showing that Sculptor and Ursa Minor's density profiles deviate
substantially from fornax's in the outskirts, and are well-described by
the tidal model from \citet{PNM2008}. Our goal is to determine, assuming
\(\Lambda\)CMD, if the effects of the Milky Way (or other satellites)
may indeed create observable tidal signatures in these galaxies. If
tides cannot explain these features, Sculptor and Ursa Minor may instead
contain a extended stellar ``halo'' or second component of the
galaxy---illustrating evidence of complex history or formation in each
galaxy and forcing formation models to confront a diversity of density
profiles in the local group.

\section{Simulating tidal effects}\label{simulating-tidal-effects}

Since the discovery of dwarf galaxies, a large body of work has
speculated, considered, or simulated tidal effects. While
pre-\emph{Gaia} work often did not know the specific orbits of dwarf
galaxies, the theory for satellites serves as an excellent framework for
understanding specific systems.

While cosmological simulations predict that mergers and satellite-galaxy
interactions are common \citep[e.g.,][]{riley+2024}, they struggle to
understand the evolution of individual dwarf galaxies. In particular,
dwarf galaxies are often barely resolved. The highest resolution
simulation of a Milky Way dark matter halo, the Aquarius project
\citep{springel+2008}, acchieved a DM resolution of
\(1.712 \times10^3 \Mo\), enough to barely resolve Sculptor like halos
(see methods). On the other hand, idealized simulations are able to
reach high resolution and numerical convergence for a single dwarf
galaxy. But, idealization may not be the most realistic environment,
neglecting mergers, assembly history, and often baryonic physics. We use
idealized simulations here which are more powerful in accurately
assessing tidal effects, given that the idealizations do not impact
these galaxies's recent history too much. As such, a long history of
work has resolved to understand the tidal evolution of dwarf galaxies
using these \emph{idealized} simulations.

Some of the earliest theory work on tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies
originate from
\citep{allen+richstone1988, moore+davis1994, johnston+spergel+hernquist1995, oh+lin+aarseth1995, piatek+pryor1995, velazquez+white1995, kroupa1997, pryor1996}.
Many of these works used similar techniques as we continue to use today,
setting up a dark matter halo in a static Milky Way potential and
predicting the evolution of quantities of interest.

More recent works include \citet{read+2006};
\citet{bullock+johnston2005}; \citet{PNM2008}; \citet{penarrubia+2009};
\citet{klimentowski+2009}; \citet{errani+2023a}; \citet{fattahi+2018};
\citet{stucker+2023}; \citet{wang+2017}.

With precise orbits and a better understanding of the Milky Way
potential and system, more recent work began to directly probe the
dynamical histories of individual dwarf galaxies. Examples include
\citet{iorio+2019} for Sculptor, \citet{borukhovetskaya+2022};
\citet{dicintio+2024} for Fornax; \citet{borukhovetskaya+2022a} for
Antlia II. Our goal is to apply a similar framework to Sculptor and Ursa
Minor.

\subsection{Simulating large gravitational systems: The N-body
method}\label{simulating-large-gravitational-systems-the-n-body-method}

Modelling gravitational evolution is essential for understanding
properties of galaxies. Perhaps the simplest method to compute the
evolution of dark matter is through \emph{N-body simulations}. A dark
matter halo is represented as a large number of dark matter particles
(bodies). Each body represents a monte-carlo sample from the underlying
matter distribution. However, galaxies are often assumed to be
\emph{collisionless}---particles are not strongly affected by
small-scale gravitational encounters. In contrast, star clusters evolve
differently as star-star gravitational collisions changes the dynamics
of the system. While we use individual gravitating bodies in N-body
simulations, the Newtonian gravitational force is softened to be a
Plummer sphere, so encounters closer than a softening length do not
substantially impact the dynamical evolution.

Naively, the newtonian gravitational force requires adding together the
forces from each particle at each particle, causing a computational cost
that scales quadratically with the number of particles, or \(O(N^2)\).
With this method, simulating a large number of particles, such as
10\^{}6, would require about 10\^{}12 force evaluations at each time
step, making cosmological and high-resolution studies unfeasible.
However, only long-range gravitational interactions tend to be important
for CMD, so we can utilize the \emph{tree method} to compute the
gravitational force vastly more efficiently.

The first gravitational tree code was introduced in
\citet{barnes+hut1986}, and is still in use today. We utilize the
massively parallel code \emph{Gadget 4} \citep{gadget4}. Particles are
spatially split into an \emph{octotree}. The tree construction stars
with one large node, a box containing all of the particles. If there is
more than one particle in a box/node , the box is then divided into 8
more nodes (halving the side length in each dimension) and this step is
repeated until each node only contains 1 particle. With this
heirarchichal organization, if a particle is sufficiently far away from
a node, then the force is well approximated by the force from the centre
of mass of the node. As such, each force calculation only requires a
walk through the tree, only descending farther into the tree as
necessary to retain accuracy. The total force calculations reduce from
\(O(N^2)\) to \(O(N\,\log N)\), representing orders of magnitude
speedup. Modern codes such as \emph{Gadget} utilize other performance
tricks, such as splitting particles across many supercomputer nodes,
efficient memory storage, adaptive time stepping, and parallel file
writing to retain fast performance for large scale simulations, forming
the foundation for many cosmological simulation codes.

\subsection{Break and tidal radii}\label{break-and-tidal-radii}

Analytic approximations are powerful tools to generally determine the
influence of tides given a dwarf galaxy and a host. A variety of ``tidal
radii'' exist in the literature, we focus on two simple forms, the
Jacobi radius and the break radius.

The \textbf{Jacobi radius} represents the approximate radius where stars
become unbound for a galaxy in a circular orbit around a host galaxy.
Calculated from an approximation of the location of the L1 and L2
lagrange points, the Jacobi radius is where the mean density of the
dwarf galaxy is three times the mean interior density of the host galaxy
at pericentre, or \begin{equation}{
3\bar \rho_{\rm MW}(r_{\rm peri}) = \bar \rho_{\rm dwarf}(r_J).
}\end{equation} If \(r_J\) occurs within the visible extent of a galaxy,
we should expect to find unbound, \emph{extratidal} stars. While most
valid for circular orbits, assuming \(r_{\rm peri}\) for the host-dwarf
distance works as most stars are lost near pericentre.

We use the \textbf{break radius} as defined in \citet{penarrubia+2009},
marking where the galaxy is still in disequilibrium. The break radius
\(r_{\rm break}\) is proportional to the velocity dispersion
\(\sigma_v\) and time since pericentre \(\Delta t\), \begin{equation}{
r_{\rm break} = C\,\sigma_{v}\,\Delta t
}\end{equation} where the scaling constant \(C \approx 0.55\) is a fit.
\(r_{\rm break}\) describes where the dynamical timescale is longer than
the time since the perturbation, i.e.~the radius within which the galaxy
should have dynamically relaxed. As illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:toy_profiles}, for an idealized model with exponential
stars in a NFW halo, after some time past pericentre, the stellar
component is smooth but contains a change in slope around
\(r_{\rm break}\), where the radial velocities of the stars becomes
positive as they still readjust to a new equilibrium.

From this argument, we note that the following properties must be
approximately true to interpret a break is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Small pericentre}. If the pericentre is too large and
  \(r_J \gg R_h\), then few stars will be lost.
\item
  Corresponding time since last pericentre: If the time since last
  pericentre is not \(\sim\) consistent with an observed break in the
  density profile, then tides
\item
  Halo evolution. As found in \citet{EN2021}, galaxies evolve along well
  defined tidal tracks (assuming spherical, isotropic, NFW halo, which
  may not be true, see \ldots). These tracks tend to ``puff up'' the
  stellar component while also removing dark matter mass, leaving a
  smaller, compacter DM halo with a more extended stellar component.
\item
  This information is mostly related to the statistical initial
  distribution of satellites from cosmology
  \citep{ludlow+2016, fattahi+2018}
\end{itemize}

\caption[Break radius validation]{The break radius of the simulations is

100 kpc. In this model, the jacobi radius is close to the break radius.
See Section~\ref{sec:methods} for a description of our simulation
setup.}\label{fig:idealized_break_radius}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tidal evolution}\label{tidal-evolution}

While the break and jacobi radii help with understanding when tidal
effects matter, we still need to know what these effects do and how a
galaxy evolves.

As a galaxy evolves in a tidal field, several changes happen:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Mass is lost}. In particular, particles and stars on weakly
  bound orbits are most likely to be removed by tides.
\item
  \emph{Steams form}. If tides are strong enough, unbound mass becomes
  part of tidal tails, evolving along a similar orbit but leading or
  trailing the galaxy.
\item
  \emph{Mass redistributes}. Bound mass of the galaxy redistributes. As
  mentioned in the last section, this is visible as a wave of outward
  moving material, with the outermost material reaching equilibrium
  last.
\item
  \emph{A new equilibrium}. With mass loss, the gravitational potential
  decreases, resulting in a more compact dark matter halo and stars
  which adiobadically expand to a larger scale radius.
\end{enumerate}

Assuming that galaxies are spherical, isotropic, and evolve in a
constant tidal field, most dwarf galaxies should evolve along similar
tidal tracks. \citet{EN2021} derive tidal tracks for dwarf galaxies,
showing that NFW halos all evolve along a similar trajectory in terms of
\(r_{\rm max}\) and \(v_{\rm max}\).

\begin{equation}{
\frac{v_{\rm max}}{v_{\rm max, 0}} = 
2^\alpha 
\left(\frac{r_{\rm max}}{r_{\rm max, 0}}\right)^{\beta}\left[1 + \left(r_{\rm max} / r_{\rm max, 0}\right)^2\right]^{-\beta}
}\end{equation} where \(\alpha=0.4\), \(\beta=0.65\) are empirical fits.
As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:tidal_tracks}, this formula works for
both circular and elliptical orbits and is independent of the initial
subhalo size or distance to the host.

\section{Thesis Outline}\label{thesis-outline}

In this thesis, our goal is to review the evidence for an extended
density profile in Ursa Minor and Sculptor, to assess the impact of
tidal effects on each galaxy, and to discuss possible interpretations
for the structure of these galaxies.

In chapter 2, we describe how we compute observational density profiles
from \citet{jensen+2024}. In chapter 3, we review our simulation
methods. Next, we present our results for the tidal stripping of
Sculptor and Ursa Minor in Chapter 4. We discuss our results,
limitations, and implications in Chapter 5. Finally, in Chapter 6, we
summarize this work and discuss future directions for similar work and
the field of dwarf galaxies.
