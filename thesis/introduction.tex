  Assumptions \& context \& past work
\item
  Evolution under tidal field
\end{itemize}

To motivate why a tidal interaction may give rise to the observed
density profiles, we create a toy simulation following \citet{PNM2008}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  NFW initial conditions (sculptor like, vcm, rcm)
\item
  Evolved in x-y plane using \citet{EP2020} potential for
  \textasciitilde{} 5Gyr with pericentre of 15 kpc and apocentre of 100
  kpc.
\item
  Exponential initial stellar profile.
\end{itemize}

As a dark matter halo is perturbed on a pericentric passage with the
milky way,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tidal stress heats halo slightly
\item
  Mass loss, particularly of loosely bound particles
\end{itemize}

The stellar component tracers will similarly follow the behaviour of the
dark matter.

An emperical estimate of where the simulation's stars are becoming
unbound is, as stated in \citet{PNM2008}, the break radius
\begin{equation}
R_b = C\,\sigma_{v}\,\Delta t
\end{equation} where \(\sigma_v\) is the present line of sight velocity
dispersion , \(\delta t\) is the time since pericentre, and
\(C \approx 0.55\) is a fit. The idea motivating this equation is stars
in the inner regions will have dynamically equilibriated to the new
potential (phase mixed), however the outer regions are no longer in
steady state, so we have to wait until the crossing time reaches them as
well.

As illustrated in fig.~\ref{fig:toy_profiles}, the density profile
initially stars off exponential. At increasing times since the first
pericentric passage, the break radius, appearing as an apparent
separation between the slopes of the inner and outer profile, increases.

\subsection{Introduction to Dark Matter
simulations}\label{introduction-to-dark-matter-simulations}

In this section, we will cover

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How are dark matter simulations conducted
\item
  Interpretations and uncertainties
\item
  Methods
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{/Users/daniel/thesis/figures/idealized_break_radius.png}}
\caption[Break radius validation]{The break radius of the simulations is
set by the time since pericentre.}\label{fig:idealized_break_radius}
\end{figure}

From this argument, we note that the following properties must be
approximately true for tides to occur:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Close enough pericentre. The other break radius \(r_J\) implies that
  if the host density is 3x the satellite, stars will be lost
\item
  Corresponding time since last pericentre: If the time since last
  pericentre is not \(\sim\) consistent with an observed break in the
  density profile, then tides
\item
  Halo evolution. As found in \citet{EN2021}, galaxies evolve along well
  defined tidal tracks (assuming spherical, isotropic, NFW halo, which
  may not be true, see \ldots). These tracks tend to ``puff up'' the
  stellar component while also removing dark matter mass, leaving a
  smaller, compacter DM halo with a more extended stellar component.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This information is mostly related to the statistical initial
    distribution of satellites from cosmology {[}ludlow+2016;
    \citet{fattahi+2018}{]}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potentials}\label{potentials}

From the \citet{nfw1996} paper, eqns. 3 \& 4 \begin{equation}
\frac{\rho}{\rho_c} = \frac{\delta_c}{(r/r_s)(1+r/r_s)^2}
\end{equation} where \begin{equation}
\delta_c = \frac{200}{3}\frac{c^3}{[\ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)]}
\end{equation} \(c\) is concentration parameter, \(\rho_c\) is the
critical density of the universe, and \(r_s\) is the characteristic
scale length of the halo.

The NFW halo is sometimes described by \(M_{200}\). \(r_{200}\) is the
radius at which the mean density of the halo interior to \(r_{200}\) is
200 times the critical density of the universe, and \(M_{200}\) is the
mass contained inside \(r_{200}\). As equations: \begin{equation}
\rho_{200} = 200\rho_{c} = \frac{M_{200}}{(4\pi/3) r_{200}^3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
r_{200} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{200}\frac{3M_{200}}{4\pi \rho_{\rm c
}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
M_{200} = \frac{4\pi}{3} r_{200}^3\ \rho_{200}
\end{equation}

\(M_{200}\) is also sometimes called the virial mass of the halo.
\(r_{200}\) is directly related to \(r_s\) by \begin{equation}
r_{200} = c\,r_s
\end{equation}

Another useful definition is \begin{equation}
A(x) \equiv \log (1+x) - \frac{x}{1+x}.
\end{equation}

We will also define a dimensionless radius \begin{equation}
x \equiv r/r_s.
\end{equation}

A simple substitution to the definition gives

\begin{equation}
\rho(x) =  \frac{\rho_s/3}{x\ (1+x)^2}
\end{equation} where \begin{equation}
\rho_s = \frac{c^3}{A(c)} \rho_{200}
\end{equation} and \(A(c)\) is as above. The characteristic density can
also be written in terms of scale mass, \(M_s = M_{200}/{A(c)}\) (see
below), giving \begin{equation}
\rho_s = \frac{c^3}{A(c)} \frac{M_{200}}{(4\pi/3)\ r_{200}^3}  = \frac{3M_s}{4\pi\, {r_s}^3}
\end{equation} Note that the NFW density profile is the same as an
alpha-beta-gamma profile where \(\alpha=\gamma=1\) and \(\beta =3\).

\subsubsection{Circular velocity}\label{circular-velocity}

The circular velocity in terms of
\(v_{200} = \sqrt{G M_{200} / R_{200}}\) is \begin{equation}
\left(v_{\rm circ}/v_{200}\right)^2 = \frac{A(x)/x}{A(c)/c},
\end{equation}

or in terms of \(M_s\) and \(r_s\), \begin{equation}
v_{\rm circ}^2 = \frac{G M(r)}{r} = \frac{G M_s A(r/r_s)}{r}.
\end{equation} Another parameterization of the NFW profile is in terms
of the maximum circular velocity \(v_{\rm circ}^{\rm max}\) and the
radius at which it is reached \(r_{\rm circ}^{\rm max}\). Given the
scale radius, \begin{equation}
r_{\rm circ}^{\rm max} = \alpha\ r_s
\end{equation}

where \(\alpha\approx2.16258\), and \(v_{\rm circ}^{\rm max}\) can be
found from either of the equations above.
