  abstract = {Infrared JHK photometry data for carbon stars in the Ursa Minor, Draco, Leo I, and Leo II dwarf spheroidal galaxies and for a number of oxygen-rich giants in these systems are reported. A comparison of the red stellar content in all seven Milky Way spheroidals is made using the photometry results. It is found that, with an exception of Ursa Minor, the most bolometrically luminous stars in all the dwarfs are carbon stars. The two mechanisms suggested to be involved in the formation of carbon stars discussed are related to thermal pulses during the asymptotic giant branch phase and to the binary mass transfer. Interpolation between globular cluster giant branches is used to derive mean abundances for the Ursa Minor, Draco, and Leo systems from the measurements of the oxygen-rich giants. Good agreement of the results with available spectrophotometric measurements, performed using J-K color, is noted.},

  abstract = {The discovery of carbon stars in the Leo I, Leo II, and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies is reported. The C2 and CN band strengths are found to be well correlated with each other, although there is a wide range in band strength at fixed color. The number of carbon stars is shown not to be a simple function of parent galaxy luminosity nor of metallicity. Only one carbon star is detected in Leo I. The newly discovered Ursa Minor C star lies well below the giant branch tip in the color-magnitude diagram, and it is suggested that the location of this star may support the argument that more than one process is required to make dwarf spheroidal carbon stars. It is concluded that mechanisms for producing carbon stars are favored in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, as opposed to globular clusters in our Galaxy, although the nature and number of the physical mechanisms required to account for the large range observed in C star luminosity and spectral appearance are still unresolved.},

Radial velocities having an accuracy within 2 km/sec have now been secured for 10 stars in Ursa Minor and 11 stars in Draco (including 16 K giants and 5 C types). Most objects have been observed at two or more epochs. Stars having nonvariable velocities yield in both dwarfs a large (about 10 km/sec) dispersion. These results cannot be explained by atmospheric motions, and circumstantial evidence suggests that the effects of undetected binaries are also not likely to be important. Instead, it seems that both spheroidals contain a substantial dark matter component, which therefore must be 'cold' in form.},

These observations demonstrate that measurement of radial velocities having such high precision is quite feasible for stars as faint as V = 18 mag. The data presented here are of importance for understanding the dynamical history of the dwarf systems. In addition, they provide a first and tantalizing hint of the velocity dispersion in a dwarf spheroidal and suggest that Draco may have a mass-to-light ratio an order of magnitude greater than that found for galactic globulars. If confirmed, this result would support the existence of a massive halo about the Galaxy. It would furthermore rule out the possibility that neutrinos could provide a solution to the missing mass problem, if the dark matter on small and large scales is similar.},

  abstract = {We present the second public data release of the Dark Energy Survey, DES DR2, based on optical/near-infrared imaging by the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the 4 m Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. DES DR2 consists of reduced single-epoch and coadded images, a source catalog derived from coadded images, and associated data products assembled from 6 yr of DES science operations. This release includes data from the DES wide-area survey covering {\textasciitilde}5000 deg2 of the southern Galactic cap in five broad photometric bands, grizY. DES DR2 has a median delivered point-spread function FWHM of g = 1.11{${''}$}, r = 0.95{${''}$}, i = 0.88{${''}$}, z = 0.83{${''}$}, and Y = 0"90, photometric uniformity with a standard deviation of {$<$} 3 mmag with respect to Gaia DR2 G band, a photometric accuracy of {\textasciitilde}11 mmag, and a median internal astrometric precision of {\textasciitilde}27 mas. The median coadded catalog depth for a 1"95 diameter aperture at signal-to-noise ratio = 10 is g = 24.7, r = 24.4, i = 23.8, z = 23.1, and Y = 21.7 mag. DES DR2 includes {\textasciitilde}691 million distinct astronomical objects detected in 10,169 coadded image tiles of size 0.534 deg2 produced from 76,217 single-epoch images. After a basic quality selection, benchmark galaxy and stellar samples contain 543 million and 145 million objects, respectively. These data are accessible through several interfaces, including interactive image visualization tools, web-based query clients, image cutout servers, and Jupyter notebooks. DES DR2 constitutes the largest photometric data set to date at the achieved depth and photometric precision.},

  abstract = {With the increasing number of large stellar survey projects, the quality and quantity of excellent tracers for studying the Milky Way are rapidly growing, one of which is the classical Cepheids. Classical Cepheids are high-precision standard candles with very low typical uncertainties ({$<$}3\%) available via the mid-infrared period-luminosity relation. About 3500 classical Cepheids identified from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova, Gaia, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Zwicky Transient Facility survey data have been analyzed in this work, and their spatial distributions show a clear signature of Galactic warp. Two kinematical methods are adopted to measure the Galactic rotation curve (RC) in the Galactocentric distance range of \$4{\textbackslash}lesssim \{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GC\}\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 19{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ . Gently declining RCs are derived by both the proper motion (PM) method and three-dimensional velocity vector (3DV) method. The largest sample of classical Cepheids with the most accurate 6D phase-space coordinates available to date are modeled in the 3DV method, and the resulting RC is found to decline at the relatively smaller gradient of (-1.33 {\textpm} 0.1) \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ . Comparing to results from the PM method, a higher rotation velocity ((232.5 {\textpm} 0.83) \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ ) is derived at the position of the Sun in the 3DV method. The virial mass and local dark matter density are estimated from the 3DV method, which is the more reliable method, \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}=(0.822{\textbackslash}pm 0.052){\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}rho \}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{DM\},{\textbackslash}odot \}=0.33{\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$ GeV, respectively.},

  abstract = {We present new constraints on the density profiles of dark matter (DM) halos in seven nearby dwarf galaxies from measurements of their integrated stellar light and gas kinematics. The gas kinematics of low-mass galaxies frequently suggest that they contain constant density DM cores, while N-body simulations instead predict a cuspy profile. We present a data set of high-resolution integral-field spectroscopy on seven galaxies and measure the stellar and gas kinematics simultaneously. Using Jeans modeling on our full sample, we examine whether gas kinematics in general produce shallower density profiles than are derived from the stars. Although two of the seven galaxies show some localized differences in their rotation curves between the two tracers, estimates of the central logarithmic slope of the DM density profile, {$\gamma$}, are generally robust. The mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic slope for the population are {$\gamma$} = 0.67 {\textpm} 0.10 when measured in the stars and {$\gamma$} = 0.58 {\textpm} 0.24 when measured in the gas. We also find that the halos are not under-concentrated at the radii of half their maximum velocities. Finally, we search for correlations of the DM density profile with stellar velocity anisotropy and other baryonic properties. Two popular mechanisms to explain cored DM halos are an exotic DM component or feedback models that strongly couple the energy of supernovae into repeatedly driving out gas and dynamically heating the DM halos. While such models do not yet have falsifiable predictions that we can measure, we investigate correlations that may eventually be used to test models. We do not find a secondary parameter that strongly correlates with the central DM density slope, but we do find some weak correlations. The central DM density slope weakly correlates with the abundance of {$\alpha$} elements in the stellar population, anti-correlates with H i fraction, and anti-correlates with vertical orbital anisotropy. We expect, if anything, the opposite of these three trends for feedback models. Determining the importance of these correlations will require further model developments and larger observational samples.},

  abstract = {We introduce the 'Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy Formation's Edge' (EDGE) project to study the cosmological formation and evolution of the smallest galaxies in the Universe. In this first paper, we explore the effects of resolution and sub-grid physics on a single low-mass halo (M\_halo=109\{ M\}\_{$\odot$}), simulated to redshift z = 0 at a mass and spatial resolution of {$\sim$} 20\{ M\}\_{$\odot$} and {$\sim$}3 pc. We consider different star formation prescriptions, supernova feedback strengths, and on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT). We show that RT changes the mode of galactic self-regulation at this halo mass, suppressing star formation by causing the interstellar and circumgalactic gas to remain predominantly warm ({$\sim$}104 K) even before cosmic reionization. By contrast, without RT, star formation regulation occurs only through starbursts and their associated vigorous galactic outflows. In spite of this difference, the entire simulation suite (with the exception of models without any feedback) matches observed dwarf galaxy sizes, velocity dispersions, V-band magnitudes, and dynamical mass-to-light-ratios. This is because such structural scaling relations are predominantly set by the host dark matter halo, with the remaining model-to-model variation being smaller than the observational scatter. We find that only the stellar mass-metallicity relation differentiates the galaxy formation models. Explosive feedback ejects more metals from the dwarf, leading to a lower metallicity at a fixed stellar mass. We conclude that the stellar mass-metallicity relation of the very smallest galaxies provides a unique constraint on galaxy formation physics.},

The existing theory is good for satellites on circular orbits but fails dramatically for noncircular orbits. The mass distribution is much less strongly truncated for elongated orbits than conventionally determined by circular theory applied at pericenter. A new first-order theory for elongated orbits is presented which is in good agreement with the simulations for pericenter not too close to the softened cluster center. For an analytic King model external potential with core radius a-prime, the theory is good down to a pericenter of 3(a-prime). Below this the maximum tide is no longer at pericenter and the theory is inappropriate. Successive passages through pericenter do not noticeably reduce the tidal radius, although continual small mass loss from second-order heating is apparent. The importance of mean field tidal limitation on galaxy evolution in clusters have been overestimated in recent studies. Galaxies on noncircular orbits in clusters are well within their tidal radii even if they pass within one core radius of the center of the cluster.},

The new potential is completely analytical; the density can be obtained from it in closed form and it is positive everywhere. Extreme mathematical simplicity is retained, as well as a good representation of the observed values of both the rotation curve and the perpendicular force. The new model consists of a spherical central bulge and a disk, both of the Miyamoto-Nagai (1975) form, plus a massive, spherical, halo. The total mass of the model is 9.00x1011 solar masses. The model escape velocity for objects in the solar vicinity is 535.7 km s-1. The values obtained for the galactic rotation constants are A = 12.95 km s-1kpc-1 and B = -12.93 km s-1kpc-1; they are in good agreement with recent observational data. In contrast to other models for our galaxy, the proposed potential function is extremely simple, fully analytical, continuous, and with continuous derivatives everywhere. The suitability of this potential for efficient and accurate numerical orbit computations is demonstrated by recalculating the orbits of several nearby, high velocity stars.},

Observational evidence of accretion events is provided by the coherent stellar streams crossing the outer haloes of massive galaxies, such as the Milky Way or Andromeda. At similar mass scales, around 1011 solar masses in stars, further evidence of merging activity is also ample. Mergers of lower-mass galaxies are expected within the hierarchical process of galaxy formation, but have hitherto not been seen for galaxies with less than about 109 solar masses in stars. Here we report the kinematic detection of a stellar stream in one of the satellite galaxies of Andromeda, the dwarf spheroidal Andromeda II, which has a mass of only 107 solar masses in stars. The properties of the stream show that we are observing the remnant of a merger between two dwarf galaxies. This had a drastic influence on the dynamics of the remnant, which is now rotating around its projected major axis. The stellar stream in Andromeda II illustrates the scale-free character of the formation of galaxies, down to the lowest galactic mass scales.},

  abstract = {A number of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are known to contain a more extended, metal-poor population with a flattish velocity dispersion profile, and a more concentrated, metal-rich population with a velocity dispersion declining with radius. The two populations can be modelled with Michie-King distribution functions (DFs) in the isothermal and in the sharply truncated limits, respectively. We argue that the truncation of the metal-rich population can be traced back to the spatial distribution of the star-forming gas. Suppose {$\delta$} is the exponent of the first non-constant term in the Taylor expansion of the total potential at the centre ({$\delta$}= 1 for Navarro-Frenk-White or NFW haloes, {$\delta$}= 2 for cored haloes). Then, we show that the ratio of the half-light radii of the populations R{$\delta$}/2h, 2/Rh, 1{$\delta$}/2 must be smaller than the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity dispersions {$\sigma$}los, 2(Rh, 2)/{$\sigma$}los, 1(Rh, 1). Specializing to the case of the Sculptor dSph, we develop a technique to fit simultaneously both populations with Michie-King DFs. This enables us to determine the mass profile of the Sculptor dSph with unprecedented accuracy in the radial range 0.2 {$<$} r {$<$} 1.2 kpc. We show that cored halo models are preferred over cusped halo models, with a likelihood ratio test rejecting NFW models at any significance level higher than 0.05 per cent. Even more worryingly, the best-fitting NFW models require concentrations with c {$\lessequivlnt$} 20, which is not in the cosmologically preferred range for dwarf galaxies. We conclude that the kinematics of multiple populations in dSphs provides a substantial new challenge for theories of galaxy formation, with the weight of available evidence strongly against dark matter cusps at the centre.},

  abstract = {A defining prediction of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model is the existence of a very large population of low mass haloes, down to planet-size masses. However, their fate as they are accreted onto haloes many orders of magnitude more massive remains fundamentally uncertain. A number of numerical explorations have found subhaloes to be very resilient to tides, but resolution limits make it difficult to explore tidal evolution at arbitrarily low masses. What are the structural properties of heavily stripped subhaloes? Do tidal effects destroy low-mass CDM subhaloes? Here we focus on cosmologically motivated subhaloes orbiting CDM hosts, and show that subhaloes of any initial mass can be stripped to arbitrarily small mass fractions. We show that previous numerical results can be reproduced by a simple model that describes tidal evolution as a progressive `peeling' in energy space and subsequent re-virialization. Tidal heating can effectively be neglected at all masses, because its importance i) does not increase for subhaloes of decreasing mass at accretion, and ii) it decreases as stripping proceeds. This allows us to predict analytically the structural properties of subhaloes with any initial mass and arbitrary degrees of mass loss. Under the hypotheses that CDM haloes have centrally divergent density profiles and approximately isotropic phase space distributions, our results prove that subhaloes of very low masses are a robust prediction of the CDM model: as for haloes, CDM subhalo populations extend and are abundant down to very low masses.},

Through modelling of the gradient and 2D density of the systems by triaxial Plummer models, we find that the distance gradients in both dwarf galaxies are inconsistent with prolate shape, but compatible with oblate or triaxial shapes. In order to explain the observed gradients, oblate models of Sextans and Sculptor need to have a significant intrinsic ellipticity larger than 0.47 for Sextans and 0.46 for Sculptor. The flattened oblate shape may imply a significant anisotropy in velocity distribution in order to be consistent with the lack of significant velocity gradients in these systems.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the Milky Way disk, which contains most of the stars in the Galaxy, is affected by several phenomena. For example, the bar and the spiral arms of the Milky Way induce radial migration of stars1 and can trap or scatter stars close to orbital resonances2. External perturbations from satellite galaxies can also have a role, causing dynamical heating of the Galaxy3, ring-like structures in the disk4 and correlations between different components of the stellar velocity5. These perturbations can also cause `phase wrapping' signatures in the disk6-9, such as arched velocity structures in the motions of stars in the Galactic plane. Some manifestations of these dynamical processes have already been detected, including kinematic substructure in samples of nearby stars10-12, density asymmetries and velocities across the Galactic disk that differ from the axisymmetric and equilibrium expectations13, especially in the vertical direction11,14-16, and signatures of incomplete phase mixing in the disk7,12,17,18. Here we report an analysis of the motions of six million stars in the Milky Way disk. We show that the phase-space distribution contains different substructures with various morphologies, such as snail shells and ridges, when spatial and velocity coordinates are combined. We infer that the disk must have been perturbed between 300 million and 900 million years ago, consistent with estimates of the previous pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Our findings show that the Galactic disk is dynamically young and that modelling it as time-independent and axisymmetric is incorrect.},

  abstract = {The Antlia dwarf galaxy, recently found to be a possible local Group member, is analyzed using VI photometry. The galaxy is resolved into a large number of stars and although the galaxy is intrinsically faint and of low surface brightness, its stellar populations reveal characteristics more typical of faint star-forming dIrs rather than dEs. Significant star formation is currently going on in the central part of Antlia although little or no star formation is taking place in the outer regions. This indicates a two-component (core-halo) morphology which appears to be common, not only in large spirals (disk-halo), but in dwarf galaxies as well. The SFR averaged over the lifetime of the galaxy is estimated to be {$\Psi$}- 1 Gyr/A{$\sim$}3-9{\texttimes}1010 Msun yr-1 pc-2 while the more recent star formation, averaged over the last 1 Gyr is much higher ({$\Psi$}1 Gyr/A{$\sim$}3- 9{\texttimes}1010 Msun yr-1 pc-2 for the central region). The total mass locked into stars and stellar remnants is estimated to be M*{$\sim$}2-4{\texttimes}106 Msun, estimated from the TRGB is 1.32{\textpm}0.06 Mpc, which places Antlia just beyond the Local Group, and makes it a close companion of the dwarf galaxy NGC 3109 ({$\Delta$}r{$\geq$}30 kpc), although it is not clear whether they are gravitationally bound.},

  abstract = {We have measured 206 radial velocities for 94 probable members in the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy and 167 velocities for 91 probable members in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. These velocities were obtained using the KPNO 4 m telescope with the Hydra multifiber positioner and bench spectrograph in 1992,1993, and 1994. Both simulations and repeated measurements show that the median uncertainty in these velocities is 4.0 km/s. Our velocities are compared with the other major datasets for Draco and Ursa Minor. Aside from a small zero-point difference, there is excellent agreement between the Hydra velocities and the Olszewski et al. MMT echelle velocities. Comparison with the Hargreaves et al. Ursa Minor velocities reveals inconsistencies which we ascribe to underestimated errors in the Hargreaves et al. data, After correcting for zero-point differences, we combine the three major sets of velocities. Our spectra recovered all of the known Carbon (C) stars in Draco and Ursa Minor and revealed one new C star in Draco and two in Ursa Minor. In addition, one star whose velocity is consistent with membership in Ursa Minor has a deep and wide H{$\beta$} absorption line in its spectrum. An initial discussion of the kinematics of the two galaxies is presented. The systemic velocities of Draco and Ursa Minor are -293.3 +/- 1.0 and -247.4 +/- 1.0 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, respectively. Ursa Minor shows apparent rotation about a position angle of 75{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} with an amplitude of about 3 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}; the morphological major axis is 53{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} +/-5{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum}. No such rotation is found in Draco. We find a velocity dispersion of 10.4 +/- 0.9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Ursa Minor including all stars and 8.8 +/- 0.8 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} excluding the star with the most extreme velocity. In Draco we find 10.7 +/- 0.9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} including all stars and 8.5 +/- 0.7 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} excluding the three stars with the most extreme velocities. These dispersions are consistent with the dispersions measured in the other two studies and confirm that Draco and Ursa Minor have the largest mass-to-light ratios of any of the dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {Aims: We aim to compute the binary fraction of "classical" dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) that are satellites of the Milky Way (MW). This value can offer insights into the binary fraction in environments that are less dense and more metal-poor than our own galaxy. Additionally, knowledge of the binary fraction in dwarf galaxies is important with respect to avoiding overestimations of their dark matter content, inferred from stellar kinematics. Methods: We refined an existing method from the literature, placing an emphasis on providing robust uncertainties on the value of the binary fraction. We applied this modified method to a VLT/FLAMES dataset for Sculptor, specifically acquired for the purpose of velocity monitoring of individual stars, as well as to literature datasets for other six MW "classical" dSphs. In all cases, the targeted stars were mainly red giant branch stars, with expected masses of around 0.8 M{$\odot$}. The VLT/FLAMES dataset offers the most precise binary fractions compared to literature datasets, due to its time baseline of 12 yr, along with at least nine repeated observations for each star. Results: We found that the binary fraction of Sculptor is 0.55-0.19+0.17. We find that it is important to take into account the Roche lobe overflow for constraining the period distribution of binary stars. In contrast to what has recently been proposed in the literature, our analysis indicates that there is no evidence to support varying the properties of the binary stellar population or their deviations from those established for the solar neighborhood, based on the sample of MW dSphs analyzed here.

  abstract = {Aims. Recently, both the presence of multiple stellar chemo-kinematic components and rotation in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy have been put into question. Therefore, we re-examine the chemo-kinematic properties of this galaxy, making use of the best spectroscopic dataset available containing both the line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of individual stars. Methods. We carried out a detailed, quantitative analysis on a recent spectroscopic dataset from the literature that contains high precision velocities and metallicities for 1339 members of Sculptor. In particular, we assessed whether Sculptor is best represented by a single stellar population with a negative metallicity gradient or by the super-position of two or more components with a different mean metallicity, spatial distribution, and kinematic properties. For this analysis, we also include the incompleteness of the spectroscopic dataset. Results. We find that Sculptor is better described by a two-population model than by a single-population model with a metallicity gradient. Moreover, given the assumptions of the current modeling, we find evidence of a third population, composed of few stars, that is more extended and metal-poor than the two other populations. This very metal-poor group of stars shows a shift of {\textasciitilde}15 km s-1 in its average line-of-sight velocity (vlos) with respect to the rest of the galaxy. We discuss several possible origins for this new population, finding a minor merger as the most likely one. We also find a vlos gradient of 4.0-1.5+1.5 km s-1 deg-1 but its statistical evidence is inconclusive and, moreover, its detection is partially driven by the group of stars with off-set velocities.},

Here we study the progenitor of the recently discovered Leiptr stellar stream, which was previously suggested to be a tidally disrupted halo globular cluster. We obtain high-resolution spectra of five red giant branch stars selected from the Gaia DR2 STREAMFINDER catalog with Magellan/MIKE. One star is a clear non-member. The remaining four stars display chemical abundances consistent with those of a low-mass dwarf galaxy: they have a low mean metallicity, \${\textbackslash}langle\{{\textbackslash}rm[Fe/H]\}{\textbackslash}rangle = -2.2\$; they do not all have identical metallicities; and they display low [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] \${\textbackslash}sim 0\$ and [Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] \${\textbackslash}sim -1\$. This pattern of low \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and neutron-capture element abundances is only found in intact dwarf galaxies with stellar mass \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Although more data are needed to be certain, Leiptr's chemistry is consistent with being the lowest-mass dwarf galaxy stream without a known intact progenitor, possibly in the mass range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Leiptr thus preserves a record of one of the lowest-mass early accretion events into the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Due to their inability to self-regulate, ultrafaint dwarfs are sensitive to prescriptions in subgrid physics models that converge and regulate at higher masses. We use high-resolution cosmological simulations to compare the effect of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) on dwarf galaxy structure for two different subgrid supernova (SN) feedback models, superbubble and blastwave, in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from 5000 {$<$} M */M {$\odot$} {$<$} 109. We find that in the "MARVEL-ous Dwarfs" suite both feedback models produce cored galaxies and reproduce observed scaling relations for luminosity, mass, and size. Our sample accurately predicts the average stellar metallicity at higher masses, however low-mass dwarfs are metal poor relative to observed galaxies in the Local Group. We show that continuous bursty star formation and the resulting stellar feedback are able to create dark matter (DM) cores in the higher dwarf galaxy mass regime, while the majority of ultrafaint and classical dwarfs retain cuspy central DM density profiles. We find that the effective core formation peaks at M */M halo {$\simeq$} 5 {\texttimes} 10-3 for both feedback models. Both subgrid SN models yield bursty SFHs at higher masses; however, galaxies simulated with superbubble feedback reach maximum mean burstiness values at lower stellar mass fractions relative to blastwave feedback. As a result, core formation may be better predicted by stellar mass fraction than the burstiness of SFHs.},

  abstract = {We determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) using an area of 143 deg2 from the first three years of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r {$<$} 19.4 mag over two-thirds and 19.8 mag over one-third of the area. The GSMF is determined from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method. This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density versus redshift. With H0= 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, the GSMF is well described between 108 and 1011.5 M{$\odot$} using a double Schechter function with ?, ?, {$\alpha$}1=-0.35, ? and {$\alpha$}2=-1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r {$<$} 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF below 108 M{$\odot$} is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low surface-brightness galaxies.},

  abstract = {Astronomical observations reveal a major deficiency in our understanding of physics---the detectable mass is insufficient to explain the observed motions in a huge variety of systems given our current understanding of gravity, Einstein's General theory of Relativity (GR). This missing gravity problem may indicate a breakdown of GR at low accelerations, as postulated by Milgromian dynamics (MOND). We review the MOND theory and its consequences, including in a cosmological context where we advocate a hybrid approach involving light sterile neutrinos to address MOND's cluster-scale issues. We then test the novel predictions of MOND using evidence from galaxies, galaxy groups, galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the universe. We also consider whether the standard cosmological paradigm ({$\Lambda$}CDM) can explain the observations and review several previously published highly significant falsifications of it. Our overall assessment considers both the extent to which the data agree with each theory and how much flexibility each has when accommodating the data, with the gold standard being a clear a priori prediction not informed by the data in question. Our conclusion is that MOND is favoured by a wealth of data across a huge range of astrophysical scales, ranging from the kpc scales of galactic bars to the Gpc scale of the local supervoid and the Hubble tension, which is alleviated in MOND through enhanced cosmic variance. We also consider several future tests, mostly at scales much smaller than galaxies.},

  abstract = {The metallicity distribution function and internal chemical variations of a galaxy are fundamental to understand its formation and assembly history. In this work, we analyze photometric metallicities for 3883 stars over seven half-light radii (\${\textbackslash}rm r\_h\$) in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (Scl dSph) galaxy, using new narrow-band imaging data from the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey conducted with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the 4-m Blanco Telescope. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of MAGIC using the Scl dSph galaxy, one of the most well-studied satellites of the Milky Way. Our sample ranges from \${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}approx - 4.0\$ to \${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}approx - 0.6\$, includes six extremely metal-poor candidates (\${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}leq -3.0\$) without previous spectroscopic observations, and is almost three times larger than the largest spectroscopic metallicity dataset in the Scl dSph. Our spatially unbiased sample of metallicities provides a more accurate representation of the metallicity distribution function, revealing a more metal-rich peak than observed in the most recent spectroscopic sample. It also reveals a break in the metallicity gradient, with a strong change in the slope: from \$-3.35 {\textbackslash}pm 0.18 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} dex {\textbackslash}, deg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for stars inside \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm r\_h\$ to \$-0.56 {\textbackslash}pm 0.26 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} dex {\textbackslash}, deg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for the outer part of the Scl dSph. Our study demonstrates that combining photometric metallicity analysis with the wide field of view of DECam offers an efficient and unbiased approach for studying the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.},

  abstract = {Until recently the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N2, or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.},

Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has had a complicated evolution and contains significant numbers of young, intermediate age and old stars. We investigate the relation between these different components by studying their photometric, kinematic and abundance distributions. Methods: . We re-derived the structural parameters of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal using our wide field imaging covering the galaxy out to its tidal radius, and analysed the spatial distribution of the Fornax stars of different ages as selected from colour-magnitude diagram analysis. We have obtained accurate velocities and metallicities from spectra in the Ca II triplet wavelength region for 562 Red Giant Branch stars which have velocities consistent with membership of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal. Results: .We have found evidence for the presence of at least three distinct stellar components: a young population (few 100 Myr old) concentrated in the centre of the galaxy, visible as a Main Sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram; an intermediate age population (2-8 Gyr old); and an ancient population ({$>$}10 Gyr), which are distinguishable from each other kinematically, from the metallicity distribution and in the spatial distribution of stars found in the colour-magnitude diagram. Conclusions: . From our spectroscopic analysis we find that the "metal rich" stars ([Fe/H]{$>$} -1.3) show a less extended and more concentrated spatial distribution, and display colder kinematics than the "metal poor" stars ([Fe/H]{$<$}-1.3). There is tentative evidence that the ancient stellar population in the centre of Fornax does not exhibit equilibrium kinematics. This could be a sign of a relatively recent accretion of external material, such as the merger of another galaxy or other means of gas accretion at some point in the fairly recent past, consistent with other recent evidence of substructure (Coleman et al. 2004, AJ, 127, 832; 2005, AJ, 129, 1443).},

The accurate velocities ({\textpm}2 km s-1) and large area coverage of Scl allow us to measure a velocity gradient of 7.6+ 3.0-2.2 km s-1 deg-1 along the projected major axis of Scl, likely a signature of intrinsic rotation. We also use our kinematic data to measure the mass distribution within this system. By considering independently the kinematics of the two distinct stellar components known to be present in Scl, we are able to relieve known degeneracies and find that the observed velocity dispersion profiles are best fitted by a cored dark matter halo with core radius rc = 0.5 kpc and mass enclosed within the last measured point M({$<$}1.8 kpc) = (3.4 {\textpm} 0.7) {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$}, assuming an increasingly radially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid. This results in a mass-to-light ratio of 158 {\textpm} 33 (M/L){$\odot$} inside 1.8 kpc. An NFW profile with concentration c = 20 and mass M({$<$}1.8 kpc) = 2.2+ 1.0-0.7 {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$} is also statistically consistent with the observations, but it tends to yield poorer fits for the metal-rich stars.

Our final sample consists of 174 probable members of Sextans with accurate line-of-sight velocities ({\textpm}2 km s-1) and CaT [Fe/H] measurements ({\textpm}0.2 dex). We use the Mg I line at 8806.8 {\AA} as an empirical discriminator for distinguishing between probable members of the dSph (giant stars) and probable Galactic contaminants (dwarf stars). Sextans shows a similar chemodynamical behaviour to other Milky Way dSphs, with its central regions being more metal rich than the outer parts and with the more metal-rich stars displaying colder kinematics than the more metal-poor stars. Hints of a velocity gradient are found along the projected major axis and along an axis at position angle (PA) = 191{$^\circ$}, however, a larger and more spatially extended sample may be necessary to pin down the amplitude and direction of this gradient. We detect a cold kinematic substructure at the centre of Sextans, consistent with being the remnant of a disrupted very metal poor stellar cluster. We derive the most extended line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile for Sextans, out to a projected radius of 1?6. From Jeans modelling of the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile we find that this is consistent with both a cored dark matter halo with large core radius and cuspy halo with low concentration. The mass within the last measured point is in the range 2-4 {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$}, giving very large mass-to-light ratios, from 460 to 920 (M/L)V, {$\odot$}.

Assessing how strong such environmental interactions may have been is therefore an important element in understanding the baryonic evolution of dSphs and their derived dark matter distribution. Here we present results from a wide-area CTIO/MOSAIC II photometric survey of the Carina dSph, reaching down to about two magnitudes below the oldest main-sequence turnoff (MSTO). This data set enables us to trace the structure of Carina in detail out to very large distances from its center, and as a function of stellar age. We observe the presence of an extended structure made up primarily of ancient MSTO stars, at distances between 25' and 60' from Carina's center, confirming results in the literature that Carina extends well beyond its nominal tidal radius. The large number statistics of our survey reveals features such as isophote twists and tails that were undetected in other previous, shallower surveys. This is the first time that such unambiguous signs of tidal disruption have been found in a Milky Way "classical" dwarf other than Sagittarius. We also demonstrate the presence of a negative age gradient in Carina directly from its MSTOs, and trace it out to very large distances from the galaxy center. The signs of interaction with the Milky Way make it unclear whether the age gradient was already in place before Carina underwent tidal disruption.},

The outputs of the analysis for each galaxy, including probabilities of membership, will be made publicly available. The analysis is augmented by a determination of the orbital properties of galaxies within 500 kpc. Methods: We adopt a flexible Bayesian methodology presented in the literature, which takes into account the location of the stars on the sky, on the colour-magnitude diagram, and on the proper motion plane. We applied some modifications, in particular to the way the colour-magnitude diagram and spectroscopic information are factored in, for example, by including stars in several evolution phases. The bulk motions were integrated in three gravitational potentials: two where the Milky Way was treated in isolation and has a mass 0.9 \& 1.6 {\texttimes} 1012 M{$\odot$}, and a time-varying potential, which includes the infall of a massive Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Results: We were able to determine bulk proper motions for 73 systems, and we consider 66 to be reliable measurements. For the first time, systemic motions are presented for galaxies out to a distance of 1.4 Mpc in the NGC 3109 association. The inclusion of the infall of a massive LMC significantly modifies the orbital trajectories of the objects, with respect to orbit integration in static Milky-Way-only potentials, and this leads to six galaxies likely being associated with the LMC, three possibly being associated with it, and one recently captured object. We discuss the results of the orbit integration in the context of the relation of the galaxies to the system of Milky Way satellites, implications for the too-big-to-fail problem, the impact on star formation histories, and tidal disruption.

  abstract = {We review our current understanding of the internal dynamical properties of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding the Milky Way. These are the most dark matter dominated galaxies, and as such may be considered ideal laboratories to test the current concordance cosmological model, and in particular provide constraints on the nature of the dominant form of dark matter. We discuss the latest observations of the kinematics of stars in these systems, and how these may be used to derive their mass distribution. We tour through the various dynamical techniques used, with emphasis on the complementarity and limitations, and discuss what the results imply also in the context of cosmological models. Finally we provide an outlook on exciting developments in this field.},

  abstract = {When interpreted within the standard framework of Newtonian gravity and dynamics, the kinematics of stars and gas in dwarf galaxies reveals that most of these systems are completely dominated by their dark matter halos. These dwarf galaxies are thus among the best astrophysical laboratories to study the structure of dark halos and the nature of dark matter. We review the properties of the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group from the point of view of stellar dynamics. After describing the observed kinematics of their stellar components and providing an overview of the dynamical modelling techniques, we look into the dark matter content and distribution of these galaxies, as inferred from the combination of observed data and dynamical models. We also briefly touch upon the prospects of using nearby dwarf galaxies as targets for indirect detection of dark matter via annihilation or decay emission.},

  abstract = {Estimates of the mass distribution and dark-matter (DM) content of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are usually derived under the assumption that the effect of the tidal field of the host galaxy is negligible over the radial extent probed by kinematic data sets. We assess the implications of this assumption in the specific case of the Fornax dSph by means of N-body simulations of a satellite orbiting around the Milky Way. We consider observationally motivated orbits and tailor the initial distributions of the satellite's stars and DM to match, at the end of the simulations, the observed structure and kinematics of Fornax. In all our simulations the present-day observable properties of Fornax are not significantly influenced by tidal effects. The DM component is altered by the interaction with the Galactic field (up to 20 per cent of the DM mass within 1.6 kpc is lost.), but the structure and kinematics of the stellar component are only mildly affected even in the more eccentric orbit (more than 99 per cent of the stellar particles remain bound to the dwarf.). In the simulations that successfully reproduce Fornax's observables, the dark-to-luminous mass ratio within 1.6 kpc is in the range 5-6, and up to 16-18 if measured within 3 kpc.},

The maximum of the surface density is not found at our adopted center but in a ringlike structure some 13" from it. We identify this feature with the subclustering identified by Olszewski \& Aaronson, who believed that it was off-center. The currently accepted King's structural parameters, r\_c and r\_t, of Ursa Minor are found to be unsuitable to represent the stellar surface density near the center. Our star counts are used to obtain a lower limit of the central stellar density without the use of the velocity dispersion. We find a lower limit of 1.7+/-1.1 M\_solar pc{\textasciicircum}-3 from stars that were counted. By extrapolating the mass function to lower masses, we estimate that the true density could increase be a factor of 7.},

We find that the amount of mass segregation in globular clusters is strongly correlated with their relaxation time and that all clusters with relaxation times of the order of their ages or longer have little to no mass segregation. For each cluster, the amount of mass segregation seen is fully compatible with the amount expected by dynamical evolution from initially unsegregated clusters, showing that globular clusters formed without primordial mass segregation among their low-mass stars. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxy candidates split into two groups, star clusters which follow the same trend between relaxation time and amount of mass segregation as globular clusters and dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies that are unsegregated despite having relaxation times smaller than a Hubble time. Stellar abundance and velocity dispersion data, where available, confirm our classification. After classification of the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy candidates, we find that outer halo star clusters have average densities inside their half-light radii of 0.03 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\rho$}h {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 M{$\odot$} pc-3, while dwarf galaxies have stellar densities of 0.001 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\rho$}h {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.03 M{$\odot$} pc-3. The reason for this separation in density is most likely a combination of the initial conditions by which the systems formed and the requirement to withstand external tidal forces.},

We furthermore calculate cluster distances from fitting nearby subdwarfs, whose absolute luminosities we determine from their Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, to globular cluster main sequences. We finally use HST-based stellar number counts to determine distances. We find good agreement in the average distances derived from the different methods down to a level of about 2 per cent. Combining all available data, we are able to derive distances to 162 Galactic globular clusters, with the distances to about 20 nearby globular clusters determined with an accuracy of 1 per cent or better.

  abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellar mass-halo mass (SM-HM) relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We provide a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation for 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 1 and discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z = 0 to z = 4. The shape and the evolution are well constrained for z {$<$} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates (0.25 dex uncertainty in normalization); however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z = 4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. We find that the integrated star formation at a given halo mass peaks at 10\%-20\% of available baryons for all redshifts from 0 to 4. This peak occurs at a halo mass of 7 {\texttimes} 1011 M sun at z = 0 and this mass increases by a factor of 5 to z = 4. At lower and higher masses, star formation is substantially less efficient, with stellar mass scaling as M * {\textasciitilde} M 2.3 h at low masses and M * {\textasciitilde} M 0.29 h at high masses. The typical stellar mass for halos with mass less than 1012 M sun has increased by 0.3-0.45 dex for halos since z {\textasciitilde} 1. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models.},

  abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8\% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe {\textohm}*h=2.0+/-0.6{\texttimes}10-3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

  abstract = {We present (V, I) photometry of two wide ({\textasciitilde}=25{\texttimes}25 arcmin2) fields centered on the low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxies Draco and Ursa Minor. New estimates of the distance to these galaxies are provided [(m-M)0(UMi)=19.41+/-0.12 and (m-M)0(Dra)=19.84+/-0.14], and a comparative study of their evolved stellar population is presented. We detect for the first time the red giant branch (RGB) bump in the luminosity function of UMi (VbumpRGB=19.40+/-0.06), while the feature is not detected in Draco. Photometric metallicity distributions are obtained for the two galaxies, and an accurate analysis to determine the intrinsic metallicity spread is performed by means of artificial star experiments. The adopted method is insensitive to stars more metal poor than [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-2.5, and it rests on the assumption that the age spread in the considered populations is small (i.e., the impact of the actual age spread on the colors of the RGB stars is negligible). We find that while the average metallicity of the two galaxies is similar ({$<$}[Fe/H]{$>$}UMi=-1.8 and Dra=-1.7), the metallicity distributions are significantly different, having different peak values ([Fe/H]modUMi=-1.9 and [Fe/H]modDra=-1.6) and different maximum metallicities. We suggest that such differences may be partly responsible for the difference in horizontal-branch morphology between the two galaxies. The intrinsic metallicity 1 {$\sigma$} spread is {$\sigma$}i=0.10 in UMi and {$\sigma$}i=0.13 in Draco. We demonstrate that the inner region of UMi is significantly structured, at odds with what is expected for a system in dynamical equilibrium. In particular, we show that the main density peak of UMi is off-center with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and shows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy. Moreover, UMi stars are shown to be clustered according to two different characteristic clustering scales, as opposed to Draco, which instead has a very symmetric and smooth density profile. The possible consequences of this striking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are briefly discussed. Combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of the total luminosity of UMi, we find that the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of this galaxy may be as low as M/L{\textasciitilde}7, a factor of 5-10 lower than current estimates.

Across the metallicity range considered, namely-3 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} -1, the stellar halo's spin is minimal, at the level of 20{$<$} {\textbackslash}bar\{v\}\_\{{\texttheta} \}(kms{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}) {$<$} 30. Using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of halo formation, we deduce that the observed acute anisotropy is inconsistent with the continuous accretion of dwarf satellites. Instead, we argue, the stellar debris in the inner halo was deposited in a major accretion event by a satellite with Mvir {$>$} 1010M{$\odot$} around the epoch of the Galactic disc formation, between 8 and 11 Gyr ago. The radical halo anisotropy is the result of the dramatic radialization of the massive progenitor's orbit, amplified by the action of the growing disc.},

  abstract = {We use a compilation of star formation histories (SFHs) and cosmological simulations to explore the impact of cosmic reionization on nearby isolated dwarf galaxies. Nearby dwarfs show a wide diversity of SFHs; from ancient systems that completed their star formation (SF) {$\sim$}10 Gyr ago to young dwarfs that formed the majority of their stars in the past {$\sim$}5 Gyr to `two-component' systems characterized by the overlap of old and young stars. As an ensemble, SF in nearby dwarfs dips to lower-than-average rates at intermediate times (4 {$<$} t/Gyr {$<$} 8), a feature caused in the simulation by cosmic reionization. Reionization heats the gas and drives it out of low-mass haloes, affecting especially systems with virial temperatures of {$\sim$}2 {\texttimes} 104 K at zreion. SF begins before zreion in systems above this threshold; its associated feedback compounds the effects of reionization, emptying the haloes of gas and leaving behind old stellar systems. In haloes below the threshold at zreion, reionization leads to a delay in the onset of SF that lasts until the halo grows massive enough to allow gas to cool and form stars, leading to a system with a prominent young stellar component. `Two-component' systems may be traced to late accretion events that allow young stars to form in systems slightly above the threshold at zreion. The dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearby dwarfs might be the clearest signature of the imprint of cosmic reionization on the SFHs of dwarf galaxies.},

We find that a number of simulated dwarfs form `outside-in', with an old, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentrated metal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like Sculptor or Sextans. We focus on a few examples where stars form in two populations distinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. The spatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; the old stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young population forms largely in situ. The older component results from a first episode of star formation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects of stellar feedback and reionization. The younger component forms when a late accretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. The effect of mergers is to disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasing their central density relative to the young population. We argue that dwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systems with multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {We examine the formation of dark matter (DM) cores in dwarf galaxies simulated with the EAGLE model of galaxy formation. As in earlier work, we find that the star formation (SF) gas density threshold ({$\rho$}th) plays a critical role. At low thresholds (LT), gas is unable to reach densities high enough to dominate the gravitational potential before being dispersed by feedback from supernovae. LT runs show little effect on the inner DM profile, even in systems with extended and bursty SF, two ingredients often cited as critical for core formation. For higher thresholds, gas is able to dominate the gravitational potential before being ejected by feedback. This can lead to a substantial reduction in the inner DM content, but only if the gas is gravitationally important over an extended period of time, allowing the halo to contract before gas removal. Rapid assembly and removal of gas in short SF bursts is less effective at altering the inner DM content. Subsequent gas accretion may draw DM back in and reform a cusp, unless SF is bursty enough to prevent it, preserving the core. Thus, for the EAGLE SF + feedback model, there is no simple relation between core formation and SF history, contrary to recent claims. The dependence of the inner DM content of dwarfs on {$\rho$}th hinders robust predictions and the interpretation of observations. A simulation of a (12 Mpc){\textasciicircum}3 volume with high {$\rho$}th results in dwarfs with sizeable cores over a limited halo mass range, but with insufficient variety in mass profiles to explain the observed diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves.},

  abstract = {The vertical structure and dynamics of stars in our local Galactic neighbourhood contains much information about the local distribution of visible and dark matter and of perturbations to the Milky Way disc. We use data on the positions and velocities of stars in the solar neighbourhood from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and large spectroscopic surveys to investigate the vertical number counts and mean velocity trend as a function of distance from the local Galactic mid-plane. We perform a detailed measurement of the wave-like north-south asymmetry in the vertical number counts, which reveals a number of deficits at heights {$\approx$}0.4, {$\approx$}0.9, and \{{$\approx$} \} 1.5 kpc, and peaks at {$\approx$}0.2, {$\approx$}0.7, and \{{$\approx$} \} 1.1 kpc. We find that the asymmetry pattern is independent of colour. The mean vertical velocity is almost constant to {$<$} 1 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} within a few 100 pc from the mid-plane and then displays a north-south symmetric dip at \{{$\approx$} \}0.5 kpc with an amplitude of \{{$\approx$} \} 2 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} that is a plausible velocity counterpart to the main number count dip at a similar height. Thus, with Gaia DR2 we confirm at high fidelity that the local Galactic disc is undergoing a wave-like oscillation and a dynamically consistent observational picture of the perturbed local vertical structure emerges for the first time. We also present the most precise and accurate determination of the Sun's height above the local Galactic mid-plane, correcting for any asymmetry in the vertical density: z\_\{{$\odot$}\} = 20.8 {\textpm} 0.3 pc.},

  abstract = {According to star formation histories (SFHs), Local Group dwarf galaxies can be broadly classified in two types: those forming most of their stars before z = 2 (fast) and those with more extended SFHs (slow). The most precise SFHs are usually derived from deep but not very spatially extended photometric data; this might alter the ratio of old to young stars when age gradients are present. Here, we correct for this effect and derive the mass formed in stars by z = 2 for a sample of 16 Local Group dwarf galaxies. We explore early differences between fast and slow dwarfs, and evaluate the impact of internal feedback by supernovae (SNe) on the baryonic and dark matter (DM) component of the dwarfs. Fast dwarfs assembled more stellar mass at early times and have larger amounts of DM within the half-light radius than slow dwarfs. By imposing that slow dwarfs cannot have lost their gas by z = 2, we constrain the maximum coupling efficiency of SN feedback to the gas and to the DM to be {$\sim$}10 per cent. We find that internal feedback alone appears insufficient to quench the SFH of fast dwarfs by gas deprivation, in particular for the fainter systems. Nonetheless, SN feedback can core the DM halo density profiles relatively easily, producing cores of the sizes of the half-light radius in fast dwarfs by z = 2 with very low efficiencies. Amongst the `classical' Milky Way satellites, we predict that the smallest cores should be found in Draco and Ursa Minor, while Sculptor and Fornax should host the largest ones.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M 31) galaxies possess rotating planes of satellites. The formation of these planes has not been explained satisfactorily so far. It has been suggested that the MW and M 31 satellites are ancient tidal dwarf galaxies; this might explain their configuration. This suggestion gained support by an analytic backward-calculation of the relative MW--M 31 orbit in the MOND modified dynamics paradigm. The result implied that the galaxies experienced a close flyby 7--11 Gyr ago.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Here we explore the Local Group history in MOND in more detail using a simplified first-ever self-consistent simulation. We describe the features induced by the encounter in the simulation and identify possible real counterparts of these features.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The initial conditions were set to eventually roughly reproduce the observed MW and M 31 masses, effective radii, separation, relative velocity, and disk inclinations. We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement code Phantom of RAMSES.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Matter was transferred from the MW to M 31 along a tidal tail in the simulation. The encounter induced the formation of several structures resembling the peculiarities of the Local Group. Most notably are that 1) a rotating planar structure formed around M 31 from the transferred material. It had a size similar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the simulated MW, just as the real plane. 2) The same structure also resembled the tidal features observed around M 31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the MW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar to that observed. 4) A cloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with the extent of the actual MW satellite system. The encounter did not end by merging in a Hubble time. The simulated stellar disks also thickened as a result of the encounter.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} The simulation demonstrated that MOND might explain many peculiarities of the Local Group; this needs to be verified with additional simulations. The simulation moreover showed that tidal features observed in galaxies, usually interpreted as merger remnants, could have been formed by matter exchange during non-merging galactic flybys in some cases.}}}}}},

  abstract = {We present the first results of an extensive photographic surface photometry of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster. The mean radial surface brightness (SB) profiles of 174dE, 20 dS0, 24E \& S0 and 7Sa galaxies are surveyed morphologically and analyzed by fitting model profiles. The main relationships found, and their interpretation, are as follows: 1. Faint dwarfs are very well described by an exponential or a King model profile. Brightward of M\_B\_{\textasciitilde} - 16, the observed profiles are increasingly brighter in the central 1 to 3 kpc than either model fit predicts. These extended SB excesses should not be confused with the nuclei; nor with E-like bulges. 2. The magnitudes of the nuclei vary greatly at a given galaxian magnitude, but the maximum nuclear luminosity is a strong function of MT. The luminosity function of the nuclei is consistent with that of the globular clusters of M 87. 3. In the radius range 0.1 to 1 kpc, the logarithmically plotted profiles of all early-type galaxies come in two well-distinct classes which we identify with classical types versus dwarf types. The former are all classified E or S0. The latter comprise all galaxies classified dE or dSO; all morphologically "intermediate" types (d: E), and even two (mis-) classified "E"s. There are no true intermediate types between E and dE. The classical-dwarf dichotomy appears strongest in the King core parameter diagrams, but it is basically model-independent. There conditions for early mass loss by galactic winds must have been very critical. The bright dwarfs may have built up their bulge-like SB excess by secondary (late) star formation. 4. The mean SB profiles of dSO galaxies are indistinguishable from bright dE profiles. Two-dimensionally, the dS0s appear highly flattened and/or show asymmetric \& irregular features, which may indicate their disk nature. Several arguments suggest that many (if not most) bright dwarfs may be rotationally supported disk galaxies, while most faint dwarfs may be spheroidals (supported by random motions). The transition at M\_B\_{\textasciitilde}-16 may reflect a critical mass for the formation or stability of stellar disks.},

The sample is unique in containing galaxies of extremely low luminosities in a wide range of environments, selected with uniform and well-understood criteria. We present the luminosity function, as well as the broadband properties, of low-luminosity galaxies in this sample. A Schechter function is an insufficient parameterization of the r-band luminosity function; there is an upturn in the slope for Mr-5logh{$>$}-18. The resulting slope at low luminosities in this sample is {$\alpha$}2{\textasciitilde}-1.3. However, we almost certainly miss a large number of galaxies at very low luminosities due to low surface brightness selection effects, and we estimate that the true low-luminosity slope may be as steep as or steeper than {$\alpha$}2{\textasciitilde}-1.5. The results here are consistent with previous SDSS results and, in the g band, roughly consistent with the results of the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey.

Any discontinuity between the baryonic and dark matter mass distributions is smoothed out by the coupled motions of the two components. If dark halos have large core radii in the absence of dissipation, the above infall scenario yields rotation curves that are flat over large distances, in agreement with observations of spiral galaxies. Such large dissipationless cores may plausibly result from large internal kinetic energy in protogalaxies at maximum expansion, perhaps as a result of subclustering, tidal effects, or anisotropic collapse.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical model of galaxy formation predicts that the Milky Way halo is populated by tidal debris of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. Due to long dynamical times, debris from the lowest mass objects remains coherent as thin and dynamically cold stellar streams for billions of years. The Gaia mission, providing astrometry and spectrophotometry for billions of stars, has brought three fundamental changes to our view of cold stellar streams in the Milky Way. First, more than a hundred stellar streams have been discovered and characterized using Gaia data. This is an order of magnitude increase in the number of well-measured streams, thanks to Gaia's capacity for identifying comoving groups of stars among the field Milky Way population. Second, Gaia data have revealed that density variations both along and across stellar streams are common. Dark-matter subhalos, as well as baryonic structures were theoretically predicted to form such features, but observational evidence for density variations was uncertain before Gaia. Third, stream kinematics are now widely available and have constrained the streams' orbits and origins. Gaia has not only provided proper motions directly, but also enabled efficient spectroscopic follow-up of the proper-motion selected targets. These discoveries have established stellar streams as a dense web of sensitive gravitational tracers in the Milky Way halo. We expect the coming decade to bring a full mapping of the Galactic population of stellar streams, as well as develop numerical models that accurately explain their evolution within the Milky Way for a variety of cosmological models. Perhaps most excitingly, the comparison between the two will be able to reveal the presence of dark-matter subhalos below the threshold for galaxy formation ({$\lessequivlnt$}106M{$\odot$}), and provide the most stringent test of the cold dark matter paradigm on small scales.},

  abstract = {The dark matter content of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy inferred from its kinematics is substantially lower than expected from LCDM cosmological simulations. We use N-body simulations to examine whether this may be the result of Galactic tides. We find that, despite improved proper motions from the Gaia mission, the pericentric distance of Fornax remains poorly constrained, mainly because its largest velocity component is roughly antiparallel to the solar motion. Translating Fornax's proper motion into a Galactocentric velocity is, thus, sensitively dependent on Fornax's assumed distance: the observed distance uncertainty, \${\textbackslash}pm 8{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$, implies pericentric distances that vary between rperi {\textasciitilde} 50 and {\textasciitilde}150 kpc. Our simulations show that for rperi in the lower range of that estimate, an LCDM subhalo with maximum circular velocity Vmax = 40 km s-1 (or virial mass \$M\_\{200\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, as expected from LCDM) would be tidally stripped to Vmax {\textasciitilde} 23 km s-1 over 10 Gyr. This would reduce the dark mass within the Fornax stellar half-mass radius to about half its initial value, bringing it into agreement with observations. Tidal stripping affects mainly Fornax's dark matter halo; its stellar component is affected little, losing less than \$5{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$ of its initial mass in the process. We also explore the effect of Galactic tides on the dynamical friction decay times of Fornax's population of globular clusters (GCs) and find little evidence for substantial changes, compared with models run in isolation. A population of GCs with initial orbital radii between 1 and 2 kpc is consistent with the present-day spatial distribution of Fornax GCs, despite assuming a cuspy halo. Neither the dark matter content nor the spatial distribution of GCs of Fornax seems inconsistent with a simple model where Fornax inhabits a tidally stripped cuspy cold dark matter halo.},

  abstract = {The unusually low velocity dispersion and large size of Crater II pose a challenge to our understanding of dwarf galaxies in the Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmogony. The low velocity dispersion suggests either a dark halo mass much lower than the minimum expected from hydrogen cooling limit arguments or one that is in the late stages of extreme tidal stripping. The tidal interpretation has been favoured in recent work and is supported by the small pericentric distances consistent with available kinematic estimates. We use N-body simulations to examine this interpretation in detail, assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for Crater II's progenitor halo. Our main finding is that, although the low velocity dispersion can indeed result from the effect of tides, the large size of Crater II is inconsistent with this hypothesis. This is because galaxies stripped to match the observed velocity dispersion are also reduced to sizes much smaller than the observed half-light radius of Crater II. Unless its size has been substantially overestimated, reconciling this system with LCDM requires that either (i) it is not bound and near equilibrium (unlikely, given its crossing time is shorter than the time elapsed since pericentre) or (ii) its progenitor halo deviates from the assumed NFW profile. The latter alternative may signal that baryons can affect the inner halo cusp even in extremely faint dwarfs or, more intriguingly, may signal effects associated with the intimate nature of the dark matter, such as finite self-interactions, or other such deviations from the canonical LCDM paradigm.},

  abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies populate the faintest end of the galaxy luminosity function and yet they apparently reside in massive dark matter halos. With mass-to-light ratios as high as M/L {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}4 , they are the key to understanding the nature of dark matter on galactic scales. Of particular interest are nearby dwarf spheroidals that appear at odds with predictions from LCDM, the standard model of cosmological structure formation. These are galaxies which exhibit unusually large sizes and low line-of-sight velocity dispersions, suggestive of surprisingly underdense dark matter halos, perhaps occurring as a result of tidal interactions with the Milky Way.     In this dissertation I present a detailed study of three carefully selected such cases: the Fornax, Crater II and Antlia II dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way. Fornax is chosen for its relatively low mass-to-light ratio, which is suggestive of a lower mass halo than indicated by abundance matching. Crater II and Antlia II, termed `feeble giants', are both chosen for their particularly low values of velocity dispersion, which are especially anomalous given their large half-light radii and low luminosities. Using N-body simulations, we investigate the evolution of these objects under the effects of Galactic tides imparted by the Milky Way potential.    Our study leads us to conclude that the low measured velocity dispersions of these dwarf galaxies are indeed consistent with a tidal interpretation in the context of predictions put forth by cosmological simulations of the Local Group and recent measurements of the galaxies' sky positions, proper motions, distances, and radial velocities. The large sizes of Crater II and Antlia II are much more difficult to reconcile in this scenario, however these are still possible to reproduce under the effect of Galactic tides, provided that initially the stellar binding energy distributions had a minimum ``cutoff''. Such a limit, which may have been imposed by baryonic effects during the formation of the galaxy, or by the presence of a constant density dark matter core, leads to transient stages with large sizes and low velocity dispersions comparable to those of Crater II and Antlia II. Detailed observations of galaxies' density profiles, corresponding logarithmic slopes, and velocity dispersion profiles may help provide insight into the likelihood of such a formation scenario for Crater II, Antlia II, and the emerging population of other feeble giant galaxies.},

  abstract = {The current popular cosmological models have granted the population of dwarf satellite galaxies a key role: their number, location, and masses constrain both the distribution of dark matter and the physical evolution of their hosts. In the past years, there has been increasing observational evidence that objects with masses of dwarf galaxies can form in the tidal tails of colliding galaxies, as well as speculations that they could become satellite-like galaxies orbiting around their progenitors and thus be cosmologically important. Yet, whether the so-called "Tidal Dwarf Galaxy" (TDG) candidates are really long-lived objects and not transient features only present in young interacting systems is still largely an open question to which numerical simulations may give precise answers. We present here a set of 96 N-body simulations of colliding galaxies with various mass ratios and encounter geometries, including gas dynamics and star formation. We study the formation and long-term evolution of their TDG candidates. Among the 593 substructures initially identified in tidal tails, about 75\% fall back onto their progenitor or are disrupted in a few 108 years. The remaining 25\% become long-lived bound objects that typically survive more than 2 Gyr with masses above 108 M{$\odot$}. These long-lived, satellite-like objects, are found to form in massive gaseous accumulations originally located in the outermost regions of the tidal tails. Studying the statistical properties of the simulated TDGs, we infer several basic properties that dwarf galaxies should meet to have a possible tidal origin and apply these criteria to the Local Group dwarfs. We further found that the presence of TDGs would foster the anisotropy observed in the distribution of classical satellite galaxies around their host. Identifying the conditions fulfilled by interacting systems that were able to form long-lived tidal dwarfs - a spiral merging with a galaxy between 1/4 and 8 times its mass, on a prograde orbit, with an orbital plane inclined up to 40 degrees to the disk plane - and estimating their fraction as a function of redshift, we roughly estimate their contribution to the overall population of dwarfs. We conclude that a small but significant fraction of them - a few percent - could be of tidal origin. This number may be underestimated in particular environments such as the vicinity of early-type galaxies or in groups.},

  abstract = {Minor mergers of galaxies are expected to be common in a hierarchical cosmology such as {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter. Though less disruptive than major mergers, minor mergers are more frequent and thus have the potential to affect galactic structure significantly. In this paper, we dissect the case-by-case outcome from a set of numerical simulations of a single satellite elliptical galaxy accreting on to a massive elliptical galaxy. We take care to explore cosmologically relevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models that include all three relevant dynamical components: dark matter haloes, stellar bulges, and central massive black holes (BHs). The effects of several different parameters are considered, including orbital energy and angular momentum, satellite density and inner density profile, satellite-to-host mass ratio, and presence of a BH at the centre of the host. BHs play a crucial role in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts, as satellites merging on to a host with a central BH are more strongly disrupted than those merging on to hosts without BHs. Orbital parameters play an important role in determining the degree of disruption: satellites on less-bound or more-eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on more-bound or more-circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentric passages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidal stripping. In addition, satellites with densities typical of faint elliptical galaxies are disrupted relatively easily, while denser satellites can survive much better in the tidal field of the host. Over the range of parameters explored, we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxy can result in a broad variety of changes, in both signs, in the surface brightness profile and colour of the central part of an elliptical galaxy. Our results show that detailed properties of the stellar components of merging satellites can strongly affect the properties of the remnants.},

  abstract = {In the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) the inner workings of dwarf satellites can be greatly affected by their mother galaxy---over and beyond tidal effects. Because of MOND's nonlinearity, a system's internal dynamics can be altered by an external field in which it is immersed (even when this field, by itself, is constant in space). As a result, the size and velocity dispersion of the satellite vary as the external field varies along its orbit. A notable outcome of this is a substantial increase in the dwarf's vulnerability to eventual tidal disruption---rather higher than Newtonian dynamics (with a dark matter halo) would lead us to expect for a satellite with given observed parameters. The space of system parameters of the dwarf may be divided according to three main criteria: It can be either external- or internal-field dominated; it can be in the adiabatic or in the impulsive regime; and it can be in the tidal or nontidal regime. The Milky Way's dwarf satellites populate all these regions of parameter space, and a single dwarf on an eccentric orbit can traverse several of them. The situation is particularly transparent in the external-field dominated, adiabatic regime where the dynamics can be described analytically: because of the variation in the external field strength with the galactocentric distance of the dwarf, R, its size changes as R-1, and the internal velocities change as R. As the dwarf approaches the center it puffs up, becoming susceptible to tidal disruption. Adiabaticity is lost roughly at the same R at which tidal effects become important. The behavior near and in the impulsive regime is studied numerically.},

  abstract = {We have developed spherically symmetric dynamical models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies using Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method. This type of modelling yields constraints both on the total mass distribution (e.g. enclosed mass and scale radius) and on the orbital structure of the system (e.g. velocity anisotropy). This method is thus less prone to biases introduced by assumptions in comparison to the more commonly used Jeans modelling, and it allows us to put reliable constraints on their dark matter content. Here we present our results for the Sculptor dSph galaxy, after testing our methods on mock data sets. We fit both the second and fourth velocity moment profiles to break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. For an Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) dark matter halo profile, we find that the mass of Sculptor within 1 kpc is M1 kpc = (1.03 {\textpm} 0.07) {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$}, and that its velocity anisotropy profile is tangentially biased and nearly constant for radii beyond {$\sim$}100 pc. The preferred concentration (c {$\sim$} 15) is low for its dark matter mass but consistent within the scatter found in N-body cosmological simulations. When we let the value of the central logarithmic slope {$\alpha$} vary, we find that the best-fitting model has {$\alpha$} = 0, although an NFW cusp or shallower is consistent at the 1{$\sigma$} confidence level. On the other hand, very cuspy density profiles with logarithmic central slopes {$\alpha$} {$<$} -1.5 are strongly disfavoured for Sculptor.},

Methods: We use orbit based dynamical models to fit the 2nd and 4th moments of the line of sight velocity distributions of the Fornax, Sculptor, Carina and Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We compare NFW, Einasto and several cored profiles for their dark halos and present the probability distribution functions of the model parameters. Results: For each galaxy separately we compare the evidence for the various dark matter profiles, and find that it is not possible to distinguish between these specific parametric dark matter density profiles using the current data. Nonetheless, from the combined evidence, we find that is unlikely that all galaxies are embedded in the same type of cored profiles of the form {$\rho$}DM {$\propto$} 1/(1 + r2){$\beta$}/2, where {$\beta$} = 3,4. For each galaxy, we also obtain an almost model independent, and therefore accurate, constraint on the logarithmic slope of the dark matter density distribution at a radius {\textasciitilde}r-3, i.e. where the logarithmic slope of the stellar density profile is -3. Conclusions: For each galaxy, we find that all best fit models essentially have the same mass distribution over a large range in radius (from just below r-3 to the last measured data point). This remarkable finding likely implies much stronger constraints on the characteristics that subhalos extracted from cosmological simulations should have in order to host the dSph galaxies around the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {In our previous work, we presented Schwarzschild models of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy demonstrating that this system could be embedded in dark matter halos that are either cusped or cored. Here, we show that the non-parametric distribution function recovered through Schwarzschild's method is bimodal in energy and angular momentum space for all of the best-fitting mass models explored. We demonstrate that this bimodality is directly related to the two components known to be present in Sculptor through stellar population analysis, although our method is purely dynamical in nature and does not use this prior information. It therefore constitutes independent confirmation of the existence of two physically distinct dynamical components in Sculptor and suggests a rather complex assembly history for this dwarf galaxy.},

  abstract = {It has been demonstrated that the inclusion of baryonic physics can alter the dark matter densities in the centers of low-mass galaxies, making the central dark matter slope more shallow than predicted in pure cold dark matter simulations. This flattening of the dark matter profile can occur in the most luminous subhalos around Milky Way mass galaxies. Zolotov et al. have suggested a correction to be applied to the central masses of dark matter-only satellites in order to mimic the affect of (1) the flattening of the dark matter cusp due to supernova feedback in luminous satellites and (2) enhanced tidal stripping due to the presence of a baryonic disk. In this paper, we apply this correction to the z = 0 subhalo masses from the high resolution, dark matter-only Via Lactea II (VL2) simulation, and find that the number of massive subhalos is dramatically reduced. After adopting a stellar mass to halo mass relationship for the VL2 halos, and identifying subhalos that are (1) likely to be destroyed by stripping and (2) likely to have star formation suppressed by photo-heating, we find that the number of massive, luminous satellites around a Milky Way mass galaxy is in agreement with the number of observed satellites around the Milky Way or M31. We conclude that baryonic processes have the potential to solve the missing satellites problem.},

  abstract = {We investigate the non-adiabatic effect of time-dependent deformations in the Milky Way (MW) halo potential on stellar streams. Specifically, we consider the MW's response to the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and how this impacts our ability to recover the spherically averaged MW mass profile from observation using stream actions. Previously, action clustering methods have only been applied to static or adiabatic MW systems to constrain the properties of the host system. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions. We find that for streams with realistic observational uncertainties on shorter orbital periods and without close encounters with the LMC, e.g. GD-1, the radial action distribution is sufficiently clustered to locally recover the MW mass profile across the stream radial range within a 2 sigma confidence interval determined using a Fisher information approach. For streams with longer orbital periods and close encounters with the LMC, e.g. Orphan-Chenab (OC), the radial action distribution disperses as the MW halo has deformed non-adiabatically. Hence, for OC streams generated in potentials that include a MW halo with any deformations, action clustering methods will fail to recover the mass profile within a 2 sigma uncertainty. Finally, we investigate whether the clustering of stream energies can provide similar constraints. Surprisingly, we find for OC-like streams, the recovered spherically averaged mass profiles demonstrate less sensitivity to the time-dependent deformations in the potential.},

The reduced central masses of the simulated satellites reproduce the observed internal dynamics of MW and M31 satellites as a function of luminosity. We use these realistic satellites to update predictions for the observed velocity and luminosity functions of satellites around MW-mass galaxies when baryonic effects are accounted for. We also predict that field dwarf galaxies in the same luminosity range as the MW classical satellites should not exhibit velocities as low as the satellites because the field dwarfs do not experience tidal stripping. Additionally, the early formation times of the satellites compared to field galaxies at the same luminosity may be apparent in the star formation histories of the two populations. Including baryonic physics in cold dark matter (CDM) models naturally explains the observed low DM densities in the MWs dwarf spheroidal population. Our simulations therefore resolve the tension between kinematics predicted in CDM theory and observations of satellites, without invoking alternative forms of DM.},

The comparison is made for a large number of clusters at a range of redshifts in three different cosmological models (cold plus hot dark matter, cold dark matter, and open cold dark matter). We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

Our statistical sample contains {\textasciitilde}5000 haloes in the range 1011-1014h-1Msolar, and the resolution allows a study of subhaloes inside host haloes. The profiles are parametrized by an NFW form with two parameters, an inner radius rs and a virial radius Rvir, and we define the halo concentration cvir{$\equiv$}Rvirrs. First, we find that, for a given halo mass, the redshift dependence of the median concentration is cvir{\textasciitilde}(1+z)-1. This corresponds to rs(z){\textasciitilde}constant, and is contrary to earlier suspicions that cvir does not vary much with redshift. The implications are that high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer than expected before. Secondly, we find that the scatter in halo profiles is large, with a 1{$\sigma$} {$\Delta$}(logcvir)=0.18 at a given mass, corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of {$\Delta$}VmaxVmax=0.12. We discuss implications for modelling the Tully-Fisher relation, which has a smaller reported intrinsic scatter. Thirdly, subhaloes and haloes in dense environments tend to be more concentrated than isolated haloes, and show a larger scatter. These results suggest that cvir is an essential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discuss implications for the universality of the Tully-Fisher relation, the formation of low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the Hubble sequence. We present an improved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relations between halo parameters and their redshift dependence, and can thus serve semi-analytic studies of galaxy formation.},

This profile is defined by one shape parameter ({$\mu$} or j0) in addition to the global spin parameter {$\lambda$}. It follows a power law M(0 at a fixed {$\lambda$}). Compared to a uniform sphere in solid-body rotation, most halos have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and high-j tails of the distribution.

The spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to be cylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo for {\textasciitilde}80\% of the halos. The more misaligned halos tend to have low {$\mu$} values. When averaged over spherical shells encompassing mass M, the halo j profiles are fitted by j(M){\textasciitilde}Ms with s=1.3+/-0.3.

  abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than {$\sim$}1 Mpc and mass scales smaller than {$\sim$}1011M{$\odot$}, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter-dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than na{\"i}vely predicted in {$\Lambda$}CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with {$\Lambda$}CDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of {$\Lambda$}CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

We model this process using a hybrid semianalytic plus N-body approach that distinguishes explicitly between the evolution of light and dark matter in accreted satellites. This distinction is essential to our ability to produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the observed number counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Our accreted stellar halos have density profiles that typically drop off with radius faster than the dark matter and follow power laws at r{$>$}{\textasciitilde}30 kpc with {$\rho$}{\textasciitilde}r-{$\alpha$}, {$\alpha$}{\textasciitilde}=3-4. They are well fit by Hernquist profiles over the full radial range. We find that stellar halos are assembled from the inside out, with the majority of mass ({\textasciitilde}80\%) coming from the {\textasciitilde}15 most massive accretion events. The satellites that contribute to the stellar halo have median accretion times of {\textasciitilde}9 Gyr in the past, while surviving satellite systems have median accretion times of {\textasciitilde}5 Gyr in the past. This implies that stars associated with the inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in surviving satellites and also from stars in the outer halo or those liberated in recent disruption events. We briefly discuss the expected spatial structure and phase-space structure for halos formed in this manner. Searches for this type of structure offer a direct test of whether cosmology is indeed hierarchical on small scales.},

Carina, Ursa Minor, and Draco, on the other hand, cannot contain a dominating dark matter component if the observed ``extratidal'' stars are located exterior to the tidal radii of these systems. The evidence for tidal stripping in the absence of dark matter is also supported by the fact that the observed cutoff radii of all three satellites are equal to their tidal radii, assuming a low, globular cluster-like mass-to-light ratio. The large velocity dispersions of these galaxies, on the other hand, provide strong evidence for a massive dark matter component. In this case, the ``extratidal'' stars lie deeply embedded in the dark matter potential wells of the satellites.

  abstract = {We present CCD images and surface photometry for the three dwarf spheroidal companions to M31. The derived light profiles are the most accurate to date for galaxies of this type and serve to define the faint end of the surface-brightness-luminosity relation for early type dwarfs. We also compute new structural parameters for a subset of the Galactic dwarf spheroidals, which indicate, when compared to the M31 dwarfs, that both sets of dwarf galaxies are similar. A B - V color is measured for And I and found to be in accord with that expected from the metallicity derived by Mould and Kristian from their color-magnitude diagram study. However, to a high degree of accuracy, we rule out their claim of a color gradient in this galaxy. The metallicity-luminosity relation for E galaxies is investigated using these and other new data. The results suggest that a change in slope occurs between the dwarfs (Z{\textasciitilde}L{\textasciicircum}0.4{\textasciicircum}) and the more luminous E galaxies (Z{\textasciitilde}L{\textasciicircum}0.6{\textasciicircum}) Furthermore, our results, together with other available data, confirm earlier suggestions that the correlation between central surface brightness and luminosity for dE galaxies breaks down for central surface brightnesses fainter than approximately 24th V mag per square arcsec; below this limit dE galaxies are found over a wide range of luminosities.},

The latter is further decomposed into the individual large accretion events that built up the Galactic stellar halo: the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Kraken and Sequoia structures, and the Sagittarius and Helmi streams. Our modelling is extensively tested using mock GC samples constructed from the AURIGA suite of hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies. We find that, on average, a proportion of the accreted GCs cannot be associated with their true infall group and are left ungrouped, biasing our recovered population numbers to \${\textbackslash}sim 80\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of their true value. Furthermore, the identified groups have a completeness and a purity of only \${\textbackslash}sim 65\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$. This reflects the difficulty of the problem, a result of the large degree of overlap in energy-action space of the debris from past accretion events. We apply the method to the Galactic data to infer, in a statistically robust and easily quantifiable way, the GCs associated with each MW accretion event. The resulting groups' population numbers of GCs, corrected for biases, are then used to infer the halo and stellar masses of the now defunct satellites that built up the halo of the MW.},

From the analysis of their integrated colours, we consider a possible link between dwarf spheroidals and giant ellipticals. From the analysis of the MV vs. (B-V) plot, we search for a possible evolutionary link between dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs). Methods: By means of chemical evolution models combined with a spectro-photometric model, we study the evolution of six Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies (Carina, Draco, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Sextans and Ursa Minor). The chemical evolution models, which adopt up-to-date nucleosynthesis from low and intermediate mass stars as well as nucleosynthesis and energetic feedback from supernovae type Ia and II, reproduce several observational constraints of these galaxies, such as abundance ratios versus metallicity and the metallicity distributions. The proposed scenario for the evolution of these galaxies is characterised by low star formation rates and high galactic wind efficiencies. Results: Such a scenario allows us to predict integrated colours and magnitudes which agree with observations. Our results strongly suggest that the first few Gyrs of evolution, when the star formation is most active, are crucial to define the luminosities, colours, and other photometric properties as observed today. After the star formation epoch, the galactic wind sweeps away a large fraction of the gas of each galaxy, which then evolves passively. Our results indicate that it is likely that at a certain stage of their evolution, dSphs and dIrrs presented similar photometric properties. However, after that phase, they evolved along different paths, leading them to their disparate present-day properties.},

  abstract = {Interpreting and modelling astronomical catalogues requires an understanding of the catalogues' completeness or selection function: what properties determine an object's probability of being including in the catalogue? Here we set out to empirically quantify the completeness of the overall catalogue of Gaia's third data release (DR3). This task is not straightforward because Gaia is the all-sky optical survey with the highest angular resolution to date and no consistent ground truth exists to allow direct comparisons. However, well-characterised deeper imaging enables an empirical assessment of Gaia's G-band completeness across parts of the sky. On this basis, we devised a simple analytical completeness model of Gaia as a function of the observed G magnitude and position over the sky, which accounts for both the effects of crowding and the complex Gaia scanning law. Our model only depends on a single quantity: the median magnitude M10 in a patch of the sky of catalogued sources with astrometric\_matched\_transits {$\leq$}10. We note that M10 reflects elementary completeness decisions in the Gaia pipeline and is computable from the Gaia DR3 catalogue itself and therefore applicable across the whole sky. We calibrated our model using the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) and tested its predictions against Hubble Space Telescope observations of globular clusters. We found that our model predicts Gaia's completeness values to a few per cent (RMS) across the sky. We make the model available as a part of the gaiaunlimited Python package built and maintained by the GaiaUnlimited project.},

  abstract = {As is usual in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, today the Local Group galaxy Ursa Minor is depleted of its gas content. How this galaxy lost its gas is still a matter of debate. To study the history of gas loss in Ursa Minor, we conducted the first three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of this object, assuming that the gas loss was driven by galactic winds powered only by type II supernovae (SNe II). The initial gas setup and supernova (SN) rates used in our simulations are mainly constrained by the inferred star formation history and the observed velocity dispersion of Ursa Minor. After 3 Gyr of evolution, we found that the gas removal efficiency is higher when the SN rate is increased, and also when the initial mean gas density is lowered. The derived mass-loss rates are systematically higher in the central regions ( 300 pc), even though such a relationship has not been strictly linear in time and in terms of the galactic radius. The filamentary structures induced by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and the concentric shells related to the acoustic waves driven by SNe can account for the inferred mass losses from the simulations. Our results suggest that SNe II are able to transfer most of the gas from the central region outward to the galactic halo. However, other physical mechanisms must be considered in order to completely remove the gas at larger radii.},

Assuming an initial baryonic-to-dark-matter ratio derived from the cosmic microwave background radiation, we evolved the galactic gas distribution over 3 Gyr, taking into account the effects of the types Ia and II supernovae. For the first time, we used in our simulation the instantaneous supernovae rates derived from a chemical evolution model applied to spectroscopic observational data of Ursa Minor. We show that the amount of gas that is lost in this process is variable with time and radius, being the highest rates observed during the initial 600 Myr in our simulation. Our results indicate that types Ia and II supernovae must be essential drivers of the gas loss in Ursa Minor galaxy (and probably in other similar dwarf galaxies), but it is ultimately the combination of galactic winds powered by these supernovae and environmental effects (e.g., ram-pressure stripping) that results in the complete removal of the gas content.},

Cosmological simulations show that in massive early-type galaxies prolate rotation likely arises from major mergers. However, the origin of such kinematics in the dwarf galaxies regime has only been explored using idealized simulations. Here, we made use of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of dwarfs galaxies with stellar mass between 3 {\texttimes} 105 and 5 {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$} to explore the formation of prolate rotators. Out of 27 dwarfs, only one system showed clear rotation around the major axis, whose culprit is a major merger at \$z\$ = 1.64, which caused the transition from an oblate to a prolate configuration. Interestingly, this galaxy displays a steep metallicity gradient, reminiscent of the one measured in Phoenix and And II: this is the outcome of the merger event that dynamically heats old, metal-poor stars, and of the centrally concentrated residual star formation. Major mergers in dwarf galaxies offer a viable explanation for the formation of such peculiar systems, characterized by steep metallicity gradients and prolate rotation.},

We caution against assigning membership to stars that are not confirmed spectroscopically, as we demonstrate that there are contaminating stars from the disrupting globular cluster NGC 5466 in the vicinity of the main body of Bo{\"o}tes III, but we note that our results are consistent with previous Bo{\"o}tes III PM estimates that did not include spectroscopic members. Based on the measured PM and other known properties of Bo{\"o}tes III, we derive its Galactocentric velocity and compute its orbit given canonical MW potentials with halo masses of both 0.8 {\texttimes} 1012 M {$\odot$} and 1.6 {\texttimes} 1012 M {$\odot$}. These orbits robustly show that Bo{\"o}tes III passed within {$\sim$}12 kpc of the Galactic center on an eccentric orbit roughly {$\sim$}140 Myr ago. Additionally, the PM of Bo{\"o}tes III is in excellent agreement with predictions for the retrograde motion of the coincident Styx stellar stream. Given this, along with the small pericenter and metallicity spread of Bo{\"o}tes III itself, we suggest that it is a disrupting dwarf galaxy giving rise to the Styx stellar stream.},

  abstract = {As a part of a project devoted to the study of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy, the star formation history of the galaxy is presented. The analysis uses wide-field photometry, encompassing about 1{$^\circ\times$}1{$^\circ$} (the total covered area being 0.75 deg2), which samples the galaxy out to its tidal radius. Derivation of the star formation history (SFH) has been performed using the synthetic partial-model technique. The resulting SFH shows that Ursa Minor hosts a predominantly old stellar population, with virtually all the stars having formed earlier than 10 Gyr ago and 90\% having formed more than 13 Gyr ago. Nevertheless, the Ursa Minor color-magnitude diagram shows several stars above the main, old turnoff forming a blue plume (BP). If these stars were genuine main-sequence stars, Ursa Minor would have maintained a low star formation rate extending up to {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago. However, several indications (relative amount and spatial distribution of BP stars and difficulty of retaining processed gas) argue against this possibility. In such a context, the most reliable hypothesis is that BP stars are blue stragglers originating in the old population, with Ursa Minor hence remaining the only Milky Way dSph satellite to host a pure old stellar population. A marginally significant age gradient is detected, in the sense that stars in outer regions are slightly younger on average. The distance of Ursa Minor has been calculated using the magnitude of the horizontal branch and a calibration based on Hipparcos data for main-sequence subdwarfs. We estimate a distance of 76+/-4 kpc, which is slightly higher than previous estimates. From the red giant branch color, we estimate a metallicity [Fe/H]=-1.9+/-0.2, in agreement with a previous spectroscopic determination. No metallicity gradients have been detected across the galaxy.},

  abstract = {Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or "tidal tracks", of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.},

  abstract = {The long-term time evolution of tidal dwarf satellite galaxieswith two different initial densities orbiting a host galaxy that resembles the Milky Way has been studied using a large set of Newtonian N-body simulations. From the simulations two maps of the orbital conditions that lead to quasi-equilibrium objects were constructed. It has been found that several orbits of the satellites allow for the existence, for about 1 Gyr or more, of out-of-equilibrium bodies with high apparent mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. Within this framework, the satellites in the quasi-stable phase reproduce the observed satellite properties for about 16 per cent of the orbit for high-density progenitors and for about 66 per cent for progenitors with lower densities. An additional simulation for a single satellite with initial mass of 107 M{$\odot$} and Plummer radius of 0.15\,kpc leads to remnants in the quasi-equilibrium phase that simultaneously reproduce remarkably well the observational quantities of the ultrafaint dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way. This satellite in the quasi-stable phase reproduces the observed satellite properties for about 42 per cent of the orbit. The results suggest that a fraction of the observed satellites could plausibly be galaxies without dark matter that have true M/L ratios much lower than those measured. The inflated M/L ratios arise because they are observed at the right time, along the right orbit and during the quasi-equilibrium phase of their evolution. This is a viable explanation for the high M/L ratios observed in all satellites as long as the satellites are preferentially on certain orbits and are observed at certain times. This could arise within the tidal dwarf galaxies scenario if all satellites are created at the same time along a few specific orbits that are particularly susceptible to the quasi-equilibrium phase.},

  abstract = {Context. Understanding the intricacies behind the presence and absence of sources in an astronomical catalogue is crucial for the accurate interpretation of astronomical data. In particular, for the multi-dimensional Gaia data, filters and cuts on different parameters or measurements introduce a selection function that may unintentionally alter scientific conclusions in subtle ways. Aims: We aim to develop a methodology to estimate the selection function for different subsamples of stars in the Gaia catalogue. Methods: Comparing the number of stars in a given subsample to that in the overall Gaia catalogue provides an estimate of the subsample membership probability as a function of sky position, magnitude, and colour. The method used to make this estimate must differentiate the stochastic absence of subsample stars from selection effects. When multiplied with the overall Gaia catalogue selection function, this provides the total selection function of the subsample. Results: We present our new method for estimating the selection function by applying it to the sources in Gaia DR3 with heliocentric radial velocity measurements. We also compute the selection function for the stars in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus sample, confirming that the apparent asymmetry of its debris across the sky is merely caused by selection effects. Conclusions: The method we have developed estimates the selection function of the stars present in a subsample of Gaia data, given that the subsample is completely contained in the Gaia parent catalogue (for which the selection function is known). This tool is made available in a GaiaUnlimited Python package.},

But recent observations indicate that the MW is atypical: it has an undersized supermassive black hole at its centre; it is surrounded by a very low mass, excessively metal-poor stellar halo; and it has an unusually large nearby satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Here, we show that the LMC is on a collision course with the MW with which it will merge in 2.4{\textasciicircum}\{+1.2\}\_\{-0.8\} \{Gyr\} (68 per cent confidence level). This catastrophic and long-overdue event will restore the MW to normality. Using the EAGLE galaxy formation simulation, we show that, as a result of the merger, the central supermassive black hole will increase in mass by up to a factor of 8. The Galactic stellar halo will undergo an equally impressive transformation, becoming 5 times more massive. The additional stars will come predominantly from the disrupted LMC, but a sizeable number will be ejected on to the halo from the stellar disc. The post-merger stellar halo will have the median metallicity of the LMC, [Fe/H] = -0.5 dex, which is typical of other galaxies of similar mass to the MW. At the end of this exceptional event, the MW will become a true benchmark for spiral galaxies, at least temporarily.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of six ultra-faint Milky Way satellites identified through matched-filter searches conducted using Dark Energy Camera (DECam) data processed as part of the second data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey. Leveraging deep Gemini/GMOS-N imaging (for four candidates) as well as follow-up DECam imaging (for two candidates), we characterize the morphologies and stellar populations of these systems. We find that these candidates all share faint absolute magnitudes (M V {$\geq$} -3.2 mag) and old, metal-poor stellar populations ({$\tau$} {$>$} 10 Gyr, [Fe/H] {$<$} -1.4 dex). Three of these systems are more extended (r 1/2 {$>$} 15 pc), while the other three are compact (r 1/2 {$<$} 10 pc). From these properties, we infer that the former three systems (Bo{\"o}tes V, Leo Minor I, and Virgo II) are consistent with ultra-faint dwarf galaxy classifications, whereas the latter three (DELVE 3, DELVE 4, and DELVE 5) are likely ultra-faint star clusters. Using data from the Gaia satellite, we confidently measure the proper motion of Bo{\"o}tes V, Leo Minor I, and DELVE 4, and tentatively detect a proper-motion signal from DELVE 3 and DELVE 5; no signal is detected for Virgo II. We use these measurements to explore possible associations between the newly discovered systems and the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, the Magellanic Clouds, and the Vast Polar Structure, finding several plausible associations. Our results offer a preview of the numerous ultra-faint stellar systems that will soon be discovered by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and highlight the challenges of classifying the faintest stellar systems.},

We extend their ideas of using the debiased estimator and further propose a bootstrap approach for constructing simultaneous confidence bands. This modified method has an advantage that we can easily choose the smoothing bandwidth from conventional bandwidth selectors and the confidence band will be asymptotically valid. We prove the validity of the bootstrap confidence band and generalize it to density level sets and inverse regression problems. Simulation studies confirm the validity of the proposed confidence bands/sets. We apply our approach to an Astronomy dataset to show its applicability.},

  abstract = {It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised \$N\$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.},

Simulations8-10 suggest that these systems formed within extended dark matter halos and experienced early galaxy mergers and feedback. However, the signatures of these events would lie outside their core regions11, where spectroscopic studies are challenging12. Here we identify members of the Tucana II ultrafaint dwarf galaxy out to nine half-light radii, demonstrating the system to be markedly more spatially extended and chemically primitive than previously found. The distant stars in this galaxy are, on average, extremely metal poor ({$\lessequivlnt$}1/1000 of the solar iron abundance), affirming Tucana II as the most metal-poor known galaxy. We observationally establish an extended dark matter halo surrounding an ultrafaint dwarf galaxy out to 1 kpc, with a total mass of {$>$}107 M{$\odot$}, consistent with a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White density profile. The extended nature of Tucana II suggests that it may have undergone strong bursty feedback or been the product of an early galactic merger10,11.

Other chemical abundances (e.g., C, iron peak) largely follow UFD trends and suggest that faint core-collapse supernovae (SNe) dominated the early evolution of Tucana II. We see a downturn in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] at [Fe/H] {$\approx$} -2.8, indicating the onset of Type Ia SN enrichment and somewhat extended chemical evolution. The most metal-rich star has strikingly low [Sc/Fe] = -1.29 {\textpm} 0.48 and [Mn/Fe] = -1.33 {\textpm} 0.33, implying significant enrichment by a sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia SN. We do not detect a radial velocity gradient in Tucana II ( \$\{\{dv\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{helio\}\}/d\{{\textbackslash}theta \}\_\{1\}=-\{2.6\}\_\{-2.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.0\}\$ km s-1 kpc-1), reflecting a lack of evidence for tidal disruption, and derive a dynamical mass of \$\{M\}\_\{1/2\}{\textbackslash},(\{r\}\_\{h\})=\{1.6\}\_\{-0.7\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\$ M {$\odot$}. We revisit formation scenarios of the extended component of Tucana II in light of its stellar chemical abundances. We find no evidence that Tucana II had abnormally energetic SNe, suggesting that if SNe drove in situ stellar halo formation, then other UFDs should show similar such features. Although not a unique explanation, the decline in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] is consistent with an early galactic merger triggering later star formation. Future observations may disentangle such formation channels of UFD outskirts. * This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

  abstract = {Stars that contain only trace amounts of elements heavier than helium, referred to as having low "metallicity", preserve the chemical fingerprints of the first generation of stars and supernovae. In the Milky Way, the lowest metallicity stars show an extreme over-abundance of carbon relative to other elements, which has been hypothesized to be a unique result of the first low-energy supernovae. However, the origin of this signature has remained a mystery, since no such stars have been discovered in the ancient dwarf galaxies where they are thought to have formed. Here, we present observations of a star in the {$>$}10 billion year old ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Pictor II, that shows the lowest iron and calcium abundances outside the Milky Way ({$<$}1/43,000th solar and {\textasciitilde}1/160,000th solar), with a factor of {$>$}3000x relative carbon enhancement. As the first unambiguous second-generation star in a relic dwarf galaxy, this object demonstrates that carbon-enhanced second-generation stars can originate in primordial small-scale systems. This star supports the hypothesis that carbon-enhancement is produced by low-energy-supernovae, since the yields of energetic supernovae are harder to retain in small-scale environments. This key local signature of chemical enrichment by the first stars traces a regime inaccessible to current high-redshift observations, which cannot detect the early enrichment of the smallest galaxies.},

  abstract = {We investigate the physical mechanisms of tidal heating and satellite disruption in cold dark matter host haloes using N-body simulations based on cosmological initial conditions. We show the importance of resonant shocks and resonant torques with the host halo to satellite heating. A resonant shock (torque) couples the radial (tangential) motion of a satellite in its orbit to its phase space. For a satellite on a circular orbit, an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR)-like resonance dominates the heating and this heating results in continuous satellite mass loss. We estimate the requirements for simulations to achieve these dynamics using perturbation theory. Both resonant shocks and resonant torques affect satellites on eccentric orbits. We demonstrate that satellite mass loss is an outside-in process in energy space; a satellite's stars and gas are thus protected by their own halo against tidal stripping. We simulate the evolution of a halo similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in our Galactic dark matter halo and conclude that the LMC stars have not yet been stripped. Finally, we present a simple algorithm for estimating the evolution of satellite mass that includes both shock heating and resonant torques.},

It is already known that a strong dichotomy exists in the gas content and star formation properties of field dwarf galaxies versus satellite dwarfs of larger galaxies. In this work, we study the more subtle differences that may be detectable in galaxies as a function of distance from a massive galaxy, such as the Milky Way. We compare smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of dwarf galaxies formed in a Local Volume-like environment (several megaparsecs away from a massive galaxy) to those formed nearer to Milky Way--mass halos. We find that the impact of environment on dwarf galaxies extends even beyond the immediate region surrounding Milky Way--mass halos. Even before being accreted as satellites, dwarf galaxies near a Milky Way--mass halo tend to have higher stellar masses for their halo mass than more isolated galaxies. Dwarf galaxies in high-density environments also tend to grow faster and form their stars earlier. We show observational predictions that demonstrate how these trends manifest in lower quenching rates, higher H I fractions, and bluer colors for more isolated dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract = {Aims: We present results from deep and very spatially extended CTIO/DECam g and r photometry (reaching out to {\textasciitilde}2 mag below the oldest main-sequence turn-off and covering {\textasciitilde}20 deg2) around the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We aim to use this dataset to study the structural properties of Sextans overall stellar population and its member stars in different evolutionary phases, as well as to search for possible signs of tidal disturbance from the Milky Way, which would indicate departure from dynamical equilibrium. Methods: We performed the most accurate and quantitative structural analysis to-date of Sextans' stellar components by applying Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain methods to the individual stars' positions. Surface density maps are built by statistically decontaminating the sample through a matched filter analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram, and then analysed for departures from axisymmetry. Results: Sextans is found to be significantly less spatially extended and more centrally concentrated than early studies suggested. No statistically significant distortions or signs of tidal disturbances were found down to a surface brightness limit of {\textasciitilde}31.8 mag/arcsec2 in V-band. We identify an overdensity in the central regions that may correspond to previously reported kinematic substructure(s). In agreement with previous findings, old and metal-poor stars such as Blue Horizontal Branch stars cover a much larger area than stars in other evolutionary phases, and bright Blue Stragglers (BSs) are less spatially extended than faint ones. However, the different spatial distribution of bright and faint BSs appears consistent with the general age and metallicity gradients found in Sextans' stellar component. This is compatible with Sextans BSs having formed by evolution of binaries and not necessarily due to the presence of a central disrupted globular cluster, as suggested in the literature. We provide structural parameters for the various populations analysed and make publicly available the photometric catalogue of point-sources as well as a catalogue of literature spectroscopic measurements with updated membership probabilities.

We also detect kinematic anomalies, in the form of a `ring-like' feature with a considerably larger systemic line-of-sight velocity and lower metallicity than the rest of stars; even the photometrically selected component with a regular looking spatial distribution displays complex kinematics.

However, accurately characterizing the dark matter content of dwarf galaxies is challenging due to limited data and complex dynamics that are difficult to accurately model. In this paper, we apply spherical Jeans modelling to simulated stellar kinematic data of spherical, isotropic dwarf galaxies with the goal of identifying the future observational directions that can improve the accuracy of the inferred dark matter distributions in the Milky Way dwarf galaxies. We explore how the dark matter inference is affected by the location and number of observed stars as well as the line-of-sight velocity measurement errors. We use mock observation to demonstrate the difficulty in constraining the inner core/cusp of the dark matter distribution with data sets of fewer than 10 000 stars. We also demonstrate the need for additional measurements to make robust estimates of the expected dark matter annihilation signal strength. For the purpose of deriving robust indirect detection constraints, we identify Ursa Major II, Ursa Minor, and Draco as the systems that would most benefit from additional stars being observed.},

  abstract = {We describe the GALFORM semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology  and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30 per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique. Our more detailed methods do not change our earlier conclusion that just over half the stars in the Universe are expected to have formed since},

  abstract = {The results of a wide-field survey of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy are presented. Our aims were to obtain an accurate map of the outer structure of Sculptor and to determine the level of interaction between this system and the Galaxy. Photometry was obtained in two colors down to the magnitude limits of V=20 and I=19, covering a 3.1d{\texttimes}3.1d area centered on Sculptor. The resulting color-magnitude data were used as a mask to select candidate horizontal-branch (HB) and red giant branch stars for this system. Previous work has shown that the red HB stars are more concentrated than the blue HB stars. We have determined the radial distributions of these two populations and show that the overall Sculptor density profile is well described by a two-component model based on a combination of these radial distributions. In addition, spectra of the Ca II triplet region were obtained for over 700 candidate red giant stars over the 10 deg2 region using the 2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These spectra were used to remove foreground Galactic stars based on radial velocity and Ca II triplet strength. The final list of Sculptor members contains 148 stars, 7 of which are located beyond the nominal tidal radius. Both the photometric and spectroscopic data sets indicate no significant extratidal structure. These results support at most a mild level of interaction between this system and the Galaxy, and we have measured an upper mass limit for extratidal material to be 2.3\%+/-0.6\% of the Sculptor luminous mass. This lack of tidal interaction indicates that previous velocity dispersion measurements (and hence the amount of dark matter detected) in this system are not strongly influenced by the Galactic tidal field.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, several ultra faint objects (UFOs, MV {$\greaterequivlnt$} -3.5) have been discovered in the outer halo of the Milky Way. For some of these objects, it is not clear whether they are star clusters or (ultra faint) dwarf galaxies. In this work, we quantify the contribution of star clusters to the population of UFOs. We extrapolated the mass and Galactocentric radius distribution of the globular clusters using a population model, finding that the Milky Way contains about 3.3{\textasciicircum}\{+7.3\}\_\{-1.6\} star clusters with MV {$\greaterequivlnt$} -3.5 and Galactocentric radius {$\geq$}20 kpc. To understand whether dissolving clusters can appear as UFOs, we run a suite of direct N-body models, varying the orbit, the Galactic potential, the binary fraction and the black hole (BH) natal kick velocities. In the analyses, we consider observational biases such as luminosity limit, field stars and line-of-sight projection. We find that star clusters contribute to both the compact and the extended population of UFOs: clusters without BHs appear compact with radii {$\sim$}5 pc, while clusters that retain their BHs after formation have radii {$\greaterequivlnt$} 20 pc. The properties of the extended clusters are remarkably similar to those of dwarf galaxies: high-inferred mass-to-light ratios due to binaries, binary properties mildly affected by dynamical evolution, no observable mass segregation and flattened stellar mass function. We conclude that the slope of the stellar mass function as a function of Galactocentric radius and the presence/absence of cold streams can discriminate between dark matter-free and dark matter-dominated UFOs.},

  abstract = {We present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. Our model is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in these simulations with stellar populations predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical evolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity function (LF) and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well with observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that accreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 7 from less than five significant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with stellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals (107-108 Msolar). In contrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these major contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the number of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently stochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which amplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo hosts. The masses ({\textasciitilde} 108-109 Msolar) and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes (from 10 to 100 kpc) are consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a complex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells and other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth models. The central regions ({$<$}10 kpc) of our haloes are highly prolate (c/a {\textasciitilde} 0.3), although we find one example of a massive accreted thick disc. Metallicity gradients in our haloes are typically significant only where the halo is built from a small number of satellites. We contrast the ages and metallicities of halo stars with surviving satellites, finding broad agreement with recent observations.},

  abstract = {The ongoing interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and its largest satellite - the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) - creates a significant perturbation in the distribution and kinematics of distant halo stars, globular clusters and satellite galaxies, and leads to biases in MW mass estimates from these tracer populations. We present a method for compensating these perturbations for any choice of MW potential by computing the past trajectory of LMC and MW and then integrating the orbits of tracer objects back in time until the influence of the LMC is negligible, at which point the equilibrium approximation can be used with any standard dynamical modelling approach. We add this orbit-rewinding step to the mass estimation approach based on simultaneous fitting of the potential and the distribution function of tracers, and apply it to two data sets with the latest Gaia EDR3 measurements of 6D phase-space coordinates: globular clusters and satellite galaxies. We find that models with LMC mass in the range \$(1{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!2) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ better fit the observed distribution of tracers, and measure MW mass within 100 kpc to be \$(0.75{\textbackslash}pm 0.1){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, while neglecting the LMC perturbation increases it by {\textasciitilde}15 per cent.},

  abstract = {We present results from 13 cosmological simulations that explore the parameter space of the `Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments' (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass {$\lessequivlnt$} M{$\star$} (the `knee' of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.},

Our input galaxy models describe the stellar mass-halo mass relation, and the galaxy occupation fraction. The number of major and minor mergers depends on the type of dark matter; in particular, minor mergers are greatly suppressed in warm dark matter models. In addition, the number of mergers that bring in stars is strongly dependent on the galaxy occupation model. For example, minor mergers are negligible for stellar halo growth in models with a high mass threshold for galaxy formation (i.e. \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9.3\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at z = 0). Moreover, this threshold for galaxy formation can also determine the relative difference (if any) between the stellar haloes of satellite and field dwarfs. Using isolated simulations of dwarf-dwarf mergers, we show that the relative frequency of major and minor mergers predict very different stellar haloes: Typically, 'intermediate' dark matter merger ratios ({\textasciitilde}1:5) maximize the growth of distant stellar haloes. We discuss the observability of dwarf stellar haloes and find that the surface brightness of these features are incredibly faint. However, when several dwarfs are stacked together, models that form particularly rich stellar haloes could be detectable. Finally, we show that stellar streams in the Galactic halo overlapping in phase space with known dwarf satellites are likely remnants of their stripped stellar haloes. The mere existence of dwarf stellar haloes can already put constraints on some small-scale models, and thus observational probes should be a high priority.},

We investigate the frequency of major mergers between dwarf galaxies in the Local Group using the ELVIS suite of cosmological zoom-in dissipationless simulations of Milky Way- and M31-like host halos. We find that {\textasciitilde}10\% of satellite dwarf galaxies with M star {$>$} 106 M {$\odot$} that are within the host virial radius experienced a major merger of stellar mass ratio closer than 0.1 since z = 1, with a lower fraction for lower mass dwarf galaxies. Recent merger remnants are biased toward larger radial distance and more recent virial infall times, because most recent mergers occurred shortly before crossing within the virial radius of the host halo. Satellite-satellite mergers also occur within the host halo after virial infall, catalyzed by the large fraction of dwarf galaxies that fell in as part of a group. The merger fraction doubles for dwarf galaxies outside of the host virial radius, so the most distant dwarf galaxies in the Local Group are the most likely to have experienced a recent major merger. We discuss the implications of these results on observable dwarf merger remnants, their star formation histories, the gas content of mergers, and massive black holes in dwarf galaxies.},

The accurately flux calibrated wide field colour-magnitude diagrams can be used to constrain the ages of different stellar populations, and also their spatial distribution. The Sculptor dSph contains a predominantly ancient stellar population ({$>$}10 Gyr old) which can be easily resolved into individual stars. A galaxy dominated by an old population provides a clear view of ancient processes of galaxy formation unimpeded by overlying younger populations. By using spectroscopic metallicities of RGB stars in combination with our deep main sequence turn-off photometry we can constrain the ages of different stellar populations with particular accuracy. We find that the known metallicity gradient in Sculptor is well matched to an age gradient. This is the first time that this link with age has been directly quantified. This gradient has been previously observed as a variation in horizontal branch properties and is now confirmed to exist for main sequence turn-offs as well. It is likely the Sculptor dSph first formed an extended metal-poor population at the oldest times, and subsequent more metal-rich, younger stars were formed more towards the centre until the gas was depleted or lost roughly 7 Gyr ago. The fact that these clear radial gradients have been preserved up to the present day is consistent with the apparent lack of signs of recent tidal interactions.

The observed luminosity-radius-metallicity relations are found to be produced naturally inside dominant halos, with a mass-radius relation that resembles the predictions of the "cold" dark matter cosmological scenario. The critical condition for global gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation is that the virial velocity be below a critical value on the order of 100 km s-1. In any hierarchial scenario for galaxy formation, this condition leads to two distinct classes of galaxies as observed: (1) the diffuse dwarfs which mostly originate from typical density perturbations; and (2) the normal, brighter galaxies which can originate only from the highest density peaks. This provides a statistical biasing mechanism for the preferential formation of bright galaxies in denser regions (clusters and superclusters).},

These galaxies -- as measured, for example, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and in the Local Group -- show tight correlations of internal velocity, metallicity and surface brightness (or radius) with M*. They define a fundamental line which distinguishes them from the brighter galaxies of high surface brightness and metallicity. The idealized model assumes spherical collapse of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes to virial equilibrium and angular momentum conservation. The relations for bright galaxies are reproduced by assuming that M* is a constant fraction of the halo mass M. The upper bound to the low-luminosity LSBs coincides with the virial velocity of haloes in which supernova feedback could significantly suppress star formation, V \&lt; 100 km s-1. We argue that the energy fed to the gas obeys ESN{$\propto$}M* despite the radiative losses, and equate it with the binding energy of the gas to obtain M*/M{$\propto$}V2. This idealized model provides surprisingly good fits to the scaling relations of low-luminosity LSBs and dwarfs, which indicates that supernova feedback had a primary role in determining the fundamental line. The apparent lower bound for galaxies at V{$\sim$} 10 km s-1 may be caused by the cooling barrier at T{$\sim$} 104 K. Some fraction of the dark haloes may show no stars as a result of complete gas removal, either by supernova winds from neighbouring galaxies or by radiative feedback after cosmological reionization at zion. Radiative feedback may also explain the distinction between dwarf spheroidals (dE) and irregulars (dI), where the dEs, typically of V{$\leq$} 30 km s-1, form stars before zion and are then cleaned out of gas, whereas the dIs, with V \&gt; 30 km s-1, retain gas-rich discs with feedback-regulated star formation.},

  abstract = {The cold dark matter picture predicts an abundance of substructure within the Galactic halo. However, most substructures host no stars and can only be detected indirectly. Stellar streams present a promising probe of this dark substructure. These streams arise from tidally stripped star clusters or dwarf galaxies, and their low dynamical temperature and negligible self-gravity give them a sharp memory of gravitational perturbations caused by passing dark substructures. For this reason, perturbed stellar streams have been the subject of substantial study. While previous studies have been largely numerical, we show here that in the diffusion regime - where stream stars are subjected to many small velocity kicks - stream perturbations can be understood on a fully analytic level. In particular, we derive how the (three-dimensional) power spectrum of the substructure density field determines the power spectrum of the (one-dimensional) density of a stellar stream. Our analytic description supplies a clear picture of the behaviour of stream perturbations in response to a perturbing environment, which may include contributions from both dark and luminous substructure. In particular, stream perturbations grow in amplitude initially, settle into a steady state, and ultimately decay. By directly relating stellar stream perturbations to the surrounding matter distribution, this analytic framework represents a versatile new tool for probing the nature of dark matter through astrophysical observations.},

  abstract = {Dark matter halos grow by hierarchical clustering as they merge together to produce ever larger structures. During these merger processes, the smaller halo can potentially survive as a subhalo of the larger halo, so a galaxy-scale halo today likely possesses a rich abundance of substructure. This substructure can greatly boost the rate of dark matter annihilation within the host halo, but the precise magnitude of this boost is clouded by uncertainty about the survival prospects of these subhalos. In particular, tidal forces gradually strip material from the subhalos, reducing their annihilation signals and potentially destroying them. In this work, we use high-resolution idealized {$N$}-body simulations to develop and tune a model that can predict the impact of this tidal evolution on the annihilation rates within subhalos. This model predicts the time evolution of a subhalo's annihilation rate as a function of three physically motivated parameters of the host-subhalo system: the energy injected into subhalo particles per orbit about the host, the ratio of stretching to compressive tidal forces, and the radial distribution of tidal heating within the subhalo. Our model will improve the accuracy of predictions of the magnitude and morphology of annihilation signals from dark matter substructure. Additionally, our parametrization can describe the time evolution of other subhalo properties, so it has implications for understanding aspects of subhalo tidal evolution beyond the annihilation rate.},

We use a one-zone chemical evolution model to fit the overall abundance patterns of {$\alpha$} elements (which probe the core-collapse supernovae that occur shortly after star formation), s-process elements (which probe AGB nucleosynthesis at intermediate delay times), and iron-peak elements (which probe delayed Type Ia supernovae). Our best-fit model indicates that Sculptor dSph has an ancient SFH, consistent with previous estimates from deep photometry. However, we derive a total star formation duration of {\textasciitilde}0.9 Gyr, which is shorter than photometrically derived SFHs. We explore the effect of various model assumptions on our measurement and find that modifications to these assumptions still produce relatively short SFHs of duration {$\lessequivlnt$}1.4 Gyr. Our model is also able to compare sets of predicted nucleosynthetic yields for supernovae and AGB stars, and can provide insight into the nucleosynthesis of individual elements in Sculptor dSph. We find that observed [Mn/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] trends are most consistent with sub-M Ch Type Ia supernova models, and that a combination of "prompt" (delay times similar to core-collapse supernovae) and "delayed" (minimum delay times {$\greaterequivlnt$}50 Myr) r-process events may be required to reproduce observed [Ba/Mg] and [Eu/Mg] trends.},

  abstract = {The stellar masses of galaxies are measured using integrated light via several methods -- however, few of these methods were designed for low-mass (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}{\textbackslash}rm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$) "dwarf" galaxies, whose properties (e.g., stochastic star formation, low metallicity) pose unique challenges for estimating stellar masses. In this work, we quantify the precision and accuracy at which stellar masses of low-mass galaxies can be recovered using UV/optical/IR photometry. We use mock observations of 469 low-mass galaxies from a variety of models, including both semi-empirical models (GRUMPY, UniverseMachine-SAGA) and cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations (MARVELous Dwarfs and FIRE-2), to test literature color-\$M\_{\textbackslash}star/L\$ relations and multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) mass estimators. We identify a list of "best practices" for measuring stellar masses of low-mass galaxies from integrated photometry. These include updated prescriptions for stellar mass based on \$g-r\$ color and WISE 3.4 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m luminosity, which are less systematically biased than literature calibrations and can recover true stellar masses of low-mass galaxies with \${\textbackslash}sim0.1\$ dex precision. When using SED fitting to estimate stellar mass, we find that the form of the assumed star formation history can induce significant biases: parametric SFHs can underestimate stellar mass by as much as \${\textbackslash}sim0.4\$ dex, while non-parametric SFHs recover true stellar masses with insignificant offset (\$-0.03{\textbackslash}pm0.11\$ dex). However, we also caution that non-informative dust attenuation priors may introduce \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ uncertainties of up to \${\textbackslash}sim0.6\$ dex.},

  abstract = {We analyse in detail the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of two different stellar populations in Andromeda II dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We obtained their detailed surface density maps together with their radial density profiles. The two populations differ not only in age and metallicity, but also in their spatial distribution and kinematics. Old stars ({$\greaterequivlnt$}11 Gyr) follow a round distribution well fitted by truncated density profiles. These stars rotate around the projected optical major axis of the galaxy with line-of-sight velocities vlos(rh) = 16 {\textpm} 3 km s-1 and a velocity gradient of 2.06 {\textpm} 0.21 km s-1 arcmin-1. Intermediate-age stars ({$\lessequivlnt$}9 Gyr) concentrate in the centre of the galaxy and form an elongated structure extending along the projected optical major axis. This structure appears to rotate with a velocity gradient of 2.24 {\textpm} 0.22 km s-1 arcmin-1 and around the optical minor axis. The centres of rotation and kinetic position angles (PAkin) of both populations differ. For intermediate-age stars we obtained PAkin = 18{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 2{$^\circ$} and for the old ones PAkin = 63{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 3{$^\circ$} in good agreement with photometric PA measured from isopleths fitted to the photometry. We conclude that the two stellar populations may not be fully relaxed and thus be the result of a merger occurred at redshift z {$\sim$} 1.75.},

We introduce new software, BEACON, designed to detect chemo-kinematic patterns among stars of different stellar populations using their metallicity and velocity along the line of sight. Applying BEACON to Fornax, we have detected non-negligible rotation signals around main optical axes of the galaxy, characteristic for a triaxial system partially supported by rotation. The dominant rotation pattern is relatively strong ({$\sim$}12 km s-1), but the galaxy also shows additional weaker albeit complex rotation patterns. Using the information available from the star formation history of Fornax, we have also derived the average age of the different chemo-kinematic components found by BEACON, which has allowed us to obtain its kinematic history. Our results point to a possible major merger suffered by Fornax at redshift z {$\sim$} 1, in agreement with the previous works.},

Results are based on the largest and most complete catalogue of stars in Fornax, with more than 3.5 {\texttimes} 105 stars covering the main body of the galaxy up to V {$\sim$} 24. We find a differentiated structure in Fornax depending on the stellar ages. Old stars ({$\greaterequivlnt$}10 Gyr) follow an elliptical distribution well fitted by King profiles with relatively large core radius (rc = 760 {\textpm} 60 pc). On another hand, young populations ({$\lessequivlnt$}3 Gyr) concentrate in the central region of the galaxy (rc = 210 {\textpm} 10 pc), and are better fitted by S{\'e}rsic profiles with 0.8 {$<$} n {$<$} 1.2, indicating some discy shape. These stars show strong asymmetries and substructures not aligned with the main optical axes of Fornax. This together with the observed differences between metallicity and age distribution maps strongly suggests accretion of material with different angular momentum.

Simultaneously, we show that the quoted discrepancy does not need for different form of dark matter as advocated by other authors. We finally show how our model can reobtain the rotation curve of remarkable outliers like IC 2574, a 8 kpc cored profile having a challenging, and extremely low rising rotation curve, and UGC 5721 a cusp-like rotation curve galaxy.

  abstract = {We study the cusp/core problem using a secondary infall model that takes into account the effect of ordered and random angular momentum, dynamical friction, and baryons adiabatic contraction (AC). The model is applied to structures on galactic scales (normal and dwarfs spiral galaxies) and on clusters of galaxies scales. Our analysis suggest that angular momentum and dynamical friction are able, on galactic scales, to overcome the competing effect of AC eliminating the cusp. The slope of density profile of inner halos flattens with decreasing halo mass and the profile is well approximated by a Burkert's profile. In order to obtain the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, starting from the profiles obtained from our model, the magnitude of angular momentum and dynamical friction must be reduced with respect to the values predicted by the model itself. The rotation curves of four lower sideband galaxies from Gentile et al. are compared to the rotation curves obtained by the model in the present paper obtaining a good fit to the observational data. The time evolution of the density profile of a galaxy of 108-109 M sun shows that after a transient steepening, due to the AC, the density profile flattens to {$\alpha$} sime 0. On cluster scales we observe a similar evolution of the dark matter (DM) density profile but in this case the density profile slope flattens to {$\alpha$} sime 0.6 for a cluster of sime1014 M sun. The total mass profile, differently from that of DM, shows a central cusp well fitted by an NFW model.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study how the dark matter density profiles of dwarf galaxies in the mass range 108-1010 M{$\odot$} are modified by the interaction of the dwarf galaxy with neighbouring structures, and by the changing baryon fraction in dwarf galaxies. With this aim, and referring to an earlier paper by Del Popolo, we determine the density profiles of the dwarf galaxies, taking into account the effect of tidal interaction with neighbouring structures, the effects of ordered and random angular momentum, dynamical friction, the response of dark matter haloes to the condensation of baryons and the effects produced by the presence of baryons. As already shown in the earlier paper, the slope of the density profile of inner haloes flattens with decreasing halo mass, and the profile is well approximated by a Burkert profile. We thus treat the angular momentum generated by tidal torques and the baryon fraction as a parameter in order to understand how the latter influences the density profiles. The analysis shows that dwarf galaxies that have suffered a smaller tidal torque (and consequently have smaller angular momentum) are characterized by steeper profiles with respect to dwarf galaxies subject to higher torque. Similarly, dwarf galaxies that have a smaller baryon fraction also have steeper profiles than those that have a larger baryon fraction. When tidal torquing is shut down and baryons are not present, the density profile is very well approximated by an Einasto profile, similarly to dwarf galaxies obtained in dissipationless N-body simulations. Then, we apply the result of the previous analysis to the dark matter halo rotation curves of three different dwarfs: NGC 2976, which is known to have a flat inner core; NGC 5949, which has a profile intermediate between a cored and a cuspy one; and NGC 5963, which has a cuspy profile. After calculating the baryon fraction, which is {$\simeq$}0.1 for the three galaxies, we fitted the rotation curves, changing the value of the angular momentum. NGC 2976 has a higher value of ordered angular momentum ({$\lambda\simeq$} 0.04) than NGC 5949 ({$\lambda\simeq$} 0.025). For NGC 5963, a very steep profile can be obtained with a low value of {$\lambda$} ({$\lambda\simeq$} 0.02) and also by decreasing the value of the random angular momentum. For NGC 2976, the tidal interaction with M81 could also have influenced the inner part of the density profile. Finally, we show how the inner density profile correlates with the tidal index for dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies given by Karachentsev et al.},

The PLC technique is calibrated by applying it to random distributions of points matching the observed global two-dimensional surface density distributions of the five galaxies. Comparison of these results shows that stars are locally distributed at random in four of these dwarf spheroidals under study, and no aggregates of stars, above the noise, are identified (excluding the obvious globular clusters). Special attention is given to the putative cluster 6 of Fornax, which we can explain as a random fluctuation of the stellar surface density. Deep CCD data of the central regions of Ursa Minor and Draco are used to place limits on possible massive black holes in these systems. No excess of stars is found in the centre of Draco, giving a limit on any central black hole of {$<$}3x10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_solar. For Ursa Minor, a non-random clump of stars is identified near the centre of the galaxy. If this clump were the signature of a black hole, as postulated by Strobel \& Lake, the black hole mass would be less than {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_solar. This is insufficient to explain the apparently high mass-to-light ratio of Ursa Minor, but significant enough to warrant further investigation.},

After investigating 8 {\texttimes} 106 possible orbits consistent with the latest proper motions, we adopt an orbital history in which the LMC and SMC have only recently become a strongly interacting binary pair. We find that their first close encounter {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr ago provides the necessary tidal forces to disrupt the disk of the SMC and thereby create the MS. The model also reproduces the on-sky bifurcation of the two filaments of the MS, and we suggest that a bound association with the MW is required to reproduce the bifurcation. Additional H I structures are created during the tidal evolution of the SMC disk, including the Magellanic Bridge, the "Counter-Bridge," and two branches of leading material. Insights into the chemical evolution of the LMC are also provided, as a substantial fraction of the material stripped away from the SMC is engulfed by the LMC. Lastly, we compare three different N-body realizations of the stellar component of the SMC, which we model as a pressure-supported spheroid motivated by recent kinematical observations. We find that an extended spheroid is better able to explain the stellar periphery of the SMC, and the tidal evolution of the spheroid may imply the existence of a stellar stream akin to the gaseous MS.},

  abstract = {We use dark matter only and full hydrodynamical Constrained Local Universe Simulations of the formation of the Local Group to study the density profile of subhaloes of the simulated Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. We show that the Einasto model provides the best description of the subhaloes' density profile, as opposed to the more commonly used Navarro, Frenk \& White profile or any generalization of it. We further find that the Einasto shape parameter nE is strongly correlated with the total subhalo mass, pointing towards the notion of a non-universality of the subhaloes' density profile. We observe that the effect of mass-loss due to tidal stripping, in both the dark matter only and the hydrodynamical run, is the reduction of the shape parameter nE between the infall and the present time. Assuming now that the dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) of our Galaxy follow the Einasto profile and using the maximum and minimum values of nE from our hydrodynamical simulation as a gauge, we can improve the observational constraints on the Rmax-Vmax pairs obtained for the brightest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. When considering only the subhaloes with -13.2 {$\lessequivlnt$} MV {$\lessequivlnt$} -8.8, i.e. the range of luminosity of the classical dwarfs, we find that all our simulated objects are consistent with the observed dSphs if their haloes follow the Einasto model with 1.6 {$\lessequivlnt$} nE {$\lessequivlnt$} 5.3. The numerically motivated Einasto profile for the observed dSphs will alleviate the recently presented `massive failures' problem.},

  abstract = {We use a suite of 31 simulated galaxies drawn from the MaGICC project to investigate the effects of baryonic feedback on the density profiles of dark matter haloes. The sample covers a wide mass range: 9.4 {\texttimes} 109 {$<$} Mhalo/ M{$\odot$} {$<$} 7.8 {\texttimes} 1011, hosting galaxies with stellar masses in the range 5.0 {\texttimes} 105 {$<$} M*/ M{$\odot$} {$<$} 8.3 {\texttimes} 1010, i.e. from dwarf to L*. The galaxies are simulated with blastwave supernova feedback and, for some of them, an additional source of energy from massive stars is included. Within this feedback scheme we vary several parameters, such as the initial mass function, the density threshold for star formation, and energy from supernovae and massive stars. The main result is a clear dependence of the inner slope of the dark matter density profile, {$\alpha$} in {$\rho$} {$\propto$} r{$\alpha$}, on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, M*/Mhalo. This relation is independent of the particular choice of parameters within our stellar feedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp versus core formation. When M*/Mhalo is low, {$\lessequivlnt$}0.01 per cent, energy from stellar feedback is insufficient to significantly alter the inner dark matter density, and the galaxy retains a cuspy profile. At higher stellar-to-halo mass ratios, feedback drives the expansion of the dark matter and generates cored profiles. The flattest profiles form where M*/Mhalo {$\sim$} 0.5 per cent. Above this ratio, stars formed in the central regions deepen the gravitational potential enough to oppose the supernova-driven expansion process, resulting in cuspier profiles. Combining the dependence of {$\alpha$} on M*/Mhalo with the empirical abundance matching relation between M* and Mhalo provides a prediction for how {$\alpha$} varies as a function of stellar mass. Further, using the Tully-Fisher relation allows a prediction for the dependence of the dark matter inner slope on the observed rotation velocity of galaxies. The most cored galaxies are expected to have Vrot {$\sim$} 50 km s-1, with {$\alpha$} decreasing for more massive disc galaxies: spirals with Vrot {$\sim$} 150 km s-1 have central slopes {$\alpha$} {$\leq$} -0.8, approaching again the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This novel prediction for the dependence of {$\alpha$} on disc galaxy mass can be tested using observational data sets and can be applied to theoretical modelling of mass profiles and populations of disc galaxies.},

The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) represents a challenge for some globular cluster (GC) formation models, because an exceptionally high fraction of its stellar mass is locked in its GC system. In order to shed light on our understanding of GC formation, we aim to constrain the amount of stellar mass that Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW). Methods. Exploiting the flexibility of effective multi-component N-body simulations and relying on state-of-the-art estimates of Fornax's orbital parameters, we study the evolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally justified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr. Results. We find that, though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of stellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most eccentric orbit considered. Conclusions. We conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal stripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass of the GC system of the Fornax dSph and we discuss quantitatively the implications for GC formation scenarios.},

We show that the median and mean profiles of halo samples of a given peak height exhibit significant deviations from the universal analytic profiles discussed previously in the literature, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, at radii r {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.5R 200m. In particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median density profiles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply than predicted. The steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r {$\approx$} R 200m, and its absolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate, reaching slopes of -4 and steeper. Importantly, we find that the outermost density profiles at r {$>$}{\textasciitilde} R 200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are rescaled by R 200m. This self-similarity indicates that radii defined with respect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure and evolution of the outer profiles. However, the inner density profiles are most self-similar when radii are rescaled by R 200c. We propose a new fitting formula that describes the median and mean profiles of halo samples selected by their peak height or mass accretion rate with accuracy {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 10\% at all radii, redshifts, and masses we studied, r {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 9R vir, 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 6, and M vir {$>$} 1.7 {\texttimes} 1010 h -1 M {$\odot$}. We discuss observational signatures of the profile features described above and show that the steepening of the outer profile should be detectable in future weak-lensing analyses of massive clusters. Such observations could be used to estimate the mass accretion rate of cluster halos.},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are powerful tools in the study of galactic evolution. As the most numerous galaxies in the universe, they probe a diverse range of environments: some exist in near-isolation, allowing us to study how a galaxy's evolution depends on its intrinsic properties. Others have been accreted by larger galaxies and show the impact of environmental processes such as tidal stripping. Because dwarf galaxies have shallow potential wells, these processes leave strong signatures in their star formation histories (SFHs). We use state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the evolution of dwarf galaxies in Local Group analogues. Their SFHs are remarkably diverse, but also show robust average trends with stellar mass and environment. Low- mass isolated dwarfs (10{\textasciicircum}5 {$<$} M{$\ast$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}6) form all of their stars in the first few Gyr, whereas their more massive counterparts have extended star formation histories, with many of the most massive dwarfs (10{\textasciicircum}7 {$<$} M{$\ast$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}9) continuing star formation until the present day. Satellite dwarfs exhibit similar trends at early and intermediate times, but with substantially suppressed star formation in the last {$\sim$} 5 Gyr, likely as a result of gas loss due to tidal and ram-pressure stripping after entering the haloes of their primaries. These simple mass and environmental trends are in good agreement with the derived SFHs of Local Group dwarfs whose photometry reaches the oldest main sequence turnoff. SFHs of galaxies with less deep data show deviations from these trends, but this may be explained, at least in part, by the large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter, the limited sample size, and the large uncertainties of the inferred SFHs.},

After correcting for asymmetric drift, the circular velocity slowly rises to a maximum value of V\_c{$\sim$}eq 55 \{km s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} at R{$\sim$}eq 2.8 kpc and possibly flattens outwards. In spite of the SMC undergoing strong gravitational interactions with its neighbours, its H I rotation curve is akin to that of many isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxies. We decompose the rotation curve and explore different dynamical models to deal with the unknown 3D shape of the mass components (gas, stars, and dark matter). We find that, for reasonable mass-to-light ratios, a dominant dark matter halo with mass M\_DM(R{$<$}4 kpc) {$\sim$}eq 1-1.5 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{$\odot$} is always required to successfully reproduce the observed rotation curve, implying a large baryon fraction of 30 per cent-40 per cent.

  abstract = {We examine the star formation history and stellar feedback effects of dwarf galaxies under the influence of extragalactic ultraviolet radiation. Previous work has indicated that the background UV flux can easily ionize the gas within typical dwarf galaxies, delaying or even preventing cooling and star formation within them. Many dwarf galaxies within the Local Group are, however, observed to contain multiple generations of stars, the oldest of which formed in the early epochs of cosmic evolution, when the background UV flux was intense. In order to address this paradox, we consider the dynamical evolution of gas in dwarf galaxies using a one-dimensional, spherically symmetric, Lagrangian numerical scheme to compute the effects of radiative transfer and photoionization. We include a physically motivated star formation recipe and consider the effects of feedback. This scheme allows us to follow the history of the gas and of star formation within dwarf galaxies, as influenced by both external and internal UV radiation. Our results indicate that star formation in the severe environment of dwarf galaxies is a difficult and inefficient process. In potentials with total mass less than a few times 106 Msolar and velocity dispersion less than a few kilometers per second, residual gas is efficiently photoionized by cosmic background UV radiation. Since the density scale height of the gas within these galaxies is comparable to their size, gas may be tidally removed from them, leaving behind starless residual dark matter clumps. For intermediate-mass systems, such as the dSphs around the Galaxy, star formation can proceed within early cosmic epochs despite the intense background UV flux. Triggering processes such as merger events, collisions, and tidal disturbance can lead to density enhancements, reducing the recombination timescale, allowing gas to cool and star formation to proceed. However, the star formation and gas retention efficiency may vary widely in galaxies with similar dark matter potentials because they depend on many factors, such as the baryonic fraction, external perturbation, initial mass function, and background UV intensity. We suggest that the presence of very old stars in these dwarf galaxies indicates that their initial baryonic-to-dark matter content was comparable to the cosmic value. This constraint suggests that the initial density fluctuation of baryonic matter may be correlated with that of the dark matter. For the more massive dwarf elliptical galaxies, the star formation efficiency and gas retention rate are much higher. Their mass-to-light ratio is regulated by star formation feedback and is expected to be nearly independent of their absolute luminosity. The results of our theoretical models reproduce the observed (M/L)-Mv correlation.},

Dwarf spheroids are dark-matter-dominated low luminosity galaxies in the nearby Universe and their origin is one of the outstanding puzzles of how galaxies form. Previous models are relevant only to dwarf spheroidals orbiting close to a giant galaxy like the Milky Way or Andromeda, and are ruled out as general theories because of the existence of dwarfs in the outskirts of the Local Group. In the new model simulations, encounters between dwarf galaxies in small groups excite a 'resonant stripping' process that transforms them into dwarf spheroidals before they are accreted by systems like the Milky Way. Within this framework, dwarf spheroidals should form and interact in pairs or small groups, leaving detectable long stellar streams and tails.},

Chief among these is the Magellanic Stream, an interwoven tail of filaments trailing the Clouds in their orbit around the Milky Way.

The Stream is thought to represent the result of tidal interactions between the Clouds and ram-pressure forces exerted by the Galactic corona, and its kinematic properties reflect the dynamical history of the pair of dwarf galaxies closest to the Milky Way. The Stream is a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations of accreting gas and cloud/corona interactions. If the Stream survives these interactions and arrives safely in the Galactic disk, its cargo of over a billion solar masses of gas has the potential to maintain or elevate the Galactic star-formation rate. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge of the Stream, including its chemical composition, physical conditions, origin, and fate. We also review the dynamics of the Magellanic System, including the proper motions and orbital history of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, the first-passage and second-passage scenarios, and the evidence for a Magellanic Group of galaxies.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for generating equilibrium models of spherical systems of collisionless particles that are finite in extent, but whose central regions resemble dark matter haloes from cosmological simulations. This method involves iteratively removing unbound particles from a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile truncated sharply at some radius. The resulting models are extremely stable, and thus provide a good starting point for N-body simulations of isolated haloes. We provide a code to generate such models for NFW and a variety of other common density profiles. We then develop an analytic approximation to this truncated distribution function. Our method proceeds by analogy with the King model, truncating and shifting the original distribution function of an infinitely extended NFW profile in energy space. We show that the density profiles of our models closely resemble the tidally truncated density profiles seen previously in studies of satellite evolution. Pursuing this analogy further with a series of simulations of tidal mass-loss, we find that our models provide a good approximation to the full distribution function of tidally stripped systems, thus allowing theoretically motivated phase-space calculations for such systems.},

  abstract = {The ability to accurately predict the evolution of tidally stripped haloes is important for understanding galaxy formation and testing the properties of dark matter. Most studies of substructure evolution make predictions based on empirical models of tidal mass-loss that are calibrated using numerical simulations. This approach can be accurate in the cases considered, but lacks generality and does not provide a physical understanding of the processes involved. Recently, we demonstrated that truncating NFW distribution functions sharply in energy results in density profiles that resemble those of tidally stripped systems, offering a path to constructing physically motivated models of tidal mass-loss. In this work, we review calculations of mass-loss based on energy truncation alone, and then consider what secondary effects may modulate mass-loss beyond this. We find that a combination of dependence on additional orbital parameters and variations in individual particle energies over an orbit results in a less abrupt truncation in energy space as a subhalo loses mass. Combining the energy truncation approach with a simple prediction for the mass-loss rate, we construct a full model of mass-loss that can accurately predict the evolution of a subhalo in terms of a single parameter {$\eta$}eff. This parameter can be fully determined from the initial orbital and halo properties, and does not require calibration with numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Accurate models of the structural evolution of dark matter subhaloes, as they orbit within larger systems, are fundamental to understanding the detailed distribution of dark matter at the present day. Numerical simulations of subhalo evolution support the idea that the mass-loss associated with tidal stripping is most naturally understood in energy space, with the particles that are the least bound being removed first. Starting from this premise, we recently proposed a zero-parameter 'energy-truncation model' for subhalo evolution. We tested this model with simulations of tidal stripping of satellites with initial NFW profiles, and showed that the energy-truncation model accurately predicts both the mass-loss and density profiles. In this work, we apply the model to a variety of Hernquist, Einasto, and King profiles. We show that it matches the simulation results quite closely in all cases, indicating that it may serve as a universal model to describe tidally stripped collision-less systems. A key prediction of the energy-truncation model is that the central density of dark matter subhaloes is conserved as they lose mass; this has important implications for dark matter annihilation calculations, and for other observational tests of dark matter.},

  abstract = {In order to backward integrate the orbits of Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies, much effort has been invested in recent years to constrain their initial phase-space coordinates. Yet equally important are the assumptions on the potential that the dwarf galaxies experience over time, especially given the fact that the MW is currently accreting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In this work, using a dark-matter-only zoom-in simulation, we test whether the use of common parametric forms of the potential is adequate to successfully backward integrate the orbits of the subhaloes from their present-day positions. We parametrize the recovered orbits and compare them with those from the simulations. We find that simple symmetric parametric forms of the potential fail to capture the complexities and the inhomogeneities of the true potential experienced by the subhaloes. More specifically, modelling a recent massive accretion like that of the LMC as a sum of two spherical parametric potentials leads to substantial errors in the recovered parameters of the orbits. These errors rival those caused due to (a) a 30 per cent uncertainty in the virial mass of the MW and (b) not modelling the potential of the recently accreted massive satellite. Our work suggests that (i) the uncertainties in the parameters of the recovered orbits of some MW dwarfs may be underestimated and that (ii) researchers should characterize the uncertainties inherent to their choice of integration techniques and assumptions of the potential against cosmological zoom-in simulations of the MW, which include a recently accreted LMC.},

We measure homogeneous distances to all systems via isochrone fitting and find good agreement (\${\textbackslash}le\$ 2\%) for the 18 UFDs that have literature RR Lyrae distances. From the ensemble of SFHs, we find: (i) an average quenching time (here defined as the lookback time by which 80\% of the stellar mass formed, \${$\tau\_$}\{80\}\$) of 12.48 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.18 Gyr ago (\$z = 4.6\_\{-0.5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.6\}\$), which is compatible with reionization-based quenching scenarios; and (ii) modest evidence of a delay (\${\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 800 Myr) in quenching times of UFDs thought to be satellites of the LMC or on their first infall, relative to long-term Galactic satellites, which is consistent with previous findings. We show that robust SFH measurement via the ancient main sequence turnoff (MSTO) requires a minimum effective luminosity (i.e., luminosity within the observed field of view) of \$M\_V {\textbackslash}leq -2.5\$, which corresponds to \${\textbackslash}sim\$100 stars around the MSTO. We also find that increasing the S/N above \${\textbackslash}sim\$100 at the MSTO does not improve SFH precision, which remains dominated by stochastic effects associated with the number of available stars. A main challenge driving the precision of UFD SFHs is limitations in the accuracy of foreground dust maps. We make all photometry catalogs public as the first data release of a larger HST archival program targeting all dwarf galaxies within \${\textbackslash}sim\$1.3 Mpc.},

  abstract = {Fuzzy dark matter (FDM), consisting of ultralight bosons, is an intriguing alternative to cold dark matter. Numerical simulations solving the Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson (SP) equation, which governs FDM dynamics, show that FDM halos consist of a central solitonic core (representing the ground state of the SP equation), surrounded by a large envelope of excited states. Wave interference gives rise to density fluctuations of order unity throughout the envelope and causes the soliton to undergo density oscillations and execute a confined random walk in the central region of the halo. The resulting gravitational potential perturbations are an efficient source of dynamical heating. Using high-resolution numerical simulations of a 6.6 {\texttimes} 109 M {$\odot$} FDM halo with boson mass m b = 8 {\texttimes} 10-23 eV, we investigate the impact of this dynamical heating on the structure and kinematics of spheroidal dwarf galaxies of a fixed mass but different initial sizes and ellipticities. The galaxies are set up in equilibrium in the time-and-azimuthally averaged halo potential and evolved for 10 Gyr in the live FDM halo. We find that they continuously increase their sizes and central velocity dispersions. In addition, their kinematic structures become strongly radially anisotropic, especially in the outskirts. Dynamical heating also causes initially ellipsoidal galaxies to become more spherical over time from the inside out and gives rise to distorted, nonconcentric isodensity contours. These telltale characteristics of dynamical heating of dwarf galaxies in FDM halos can potentially be used to constrain the boson mass.},

  abstract = {We present the evolution of the structure of relaxed cold dark matter (CDM) haloes in the cosmology from the Planck satellite. Our simulations cover five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. Because of the increased matter density and power spectrum normalization the concentration-mass relation in the Planck cosmology has a {$\sim$}20 per cent higher normalization at redshift z = 0 compared to Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe cosmology. We confirm that CDM haloes are better described by the Einasto profile; for example, at scales near galaxy half-light radii CDM haloes have significantly steeper density profiles than implied by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) fits. There is a scatter of {$\sim$}0.2 dex in the Einasto shape parameter at fixed halo mass, adding further to the diversity of CDM halo profiles. The evolution of the concentration-mass relation in our simulations is not reproduced by any of the analytic models in the literature. We thus provide a simple fitting formula that accurately describes the evolution between redshifts z = 5 and 0 for both NFW and Einasto fits. Finally, the observed concentrations and halo masses of spiral galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts are in good agreement with our simulations, suggesting only mild halo response to galaxy formation on these scales.},

  abstract = {One of the most important unresolved issues for galaxy formation theory is to understand the origin of exponential galaxy discs. We use a disc galaxy evolution model to investigate whether galaxies with exponential surface brightness profiles can be produced in a cosmologically motivated framework for disc galaxy formation. Our model follows the accretion, cooling and ejection of baryonic mass, as a function of radius, inside growing dark matter haloes. The surface density profile of the disc is determined by detailed angular momentum conservation, starting from the distribution of specific angular momentum as found in cosmological simulations. Exponential and quasi-exponential discs can be produced by our model through a combination of supernova-driven galactic outflows (which preferentially remove low angular momentum material), intrinsic variation in the angular momentum distribution of the halo gas and the inefficiency of star formation at large radii. We use observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) New York University Value Added Catalog (NYU-VAGC) to show that the median S{\'e}rsic index of late-type galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For blue galaxies, low-mass galaxies have n {\textasciitilde}= 1.3, while high-mass galaxies have n {\textasciitilde}= 4, with a transition mass of Mstar {\textasciitilde}= 2.5 {\texttimes} 1010Msolar. Our model with energy-driven outflows correctly reproduces this trend, whereas our models with momentum-driven outflows and no outflows overpredict the S{\'e}rsic indices in low-mass galaxies. We show that the observed fraction of `bulge-less' exponential galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For Milky Way mass galaxies (Vrot {\textasciitilde}= 220kms-1, Mstar {\textasciitilde}= 1011Msolar), less than 0.1 per cent of blue galaxies are bulge-less, whereas for M33 mass galaxies (Vrot {\textasciitilde}= 120kms-1, Mstar {\textasciitilde}= 1010Msolar) bulge-less and quasi-bulge-less galaxies are more common, with 45 per cent of blue galaxies having the S{\'e}rsic index n {$<$} 1.5. These results suggest that the difficulty of hierarchical formation models to produce bulge-less Milky Way mass galaxies is, in fact, not a problem. However, the problem of producing M33-like galaxies remains, and will provide a key test for hierarchical galaxy formation models, and feedback models in particular.},

  abstract = {We measure the circular velocity curve v c(R) of the Milky Way with the highest precision to date across Galactocentric distances of 5 {$\leq$} R {$\leq$} 25 kpc. Our analysis draws on the six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of {$\greaterequivlnt$}23,000 luminous red giant stars, for which we previously determined precise parallaxes using a data-driven model that combines spectral data from APOGEE with photometric information from WISE, 2MASS, and Gaia. We derive the circular velocity curve with the Jeans equation assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential. At the location of the Sun we determine the circular velocity with its formal uncertainty to be vc(R{$\odot$} ) = (229.0+/- 0.2) km s-1 with systematic uncertainties at the {$\sim$}2\%-5\% level. We find that the velocity curve is gently but significantly declining at (-1.7 {\textpm} 0.1) km s-1 kpc-1, with a systematic uncertainty of 0.46 km s-1 kpc-1, beyond the inner 5 kpc. We exclude the inner 5 kpc from our analysis due to the presence of the Galactic bar, which strongly influences the kinematic structure and requires modeling in a nonaxisymmetric potential. Combining our results with external measurements of the mass distribution for the baryonic components of the Milky Way from other studies, we estimate the Galaxy's dark halo mass within the virial radius to be Mvir = (7.25+/- 0.26){\textbackslash}cdot 1011 M{$\odot$} and a local dark matter density of {$\rho$} dm(R{$\odot$} ) = 0.30+/- 0.03 GeV cm-3.},

  abstract = {We examine the effects of stellar feedback and bursty star formation on low-mass galaxies (Mstar = 2 {\texttimes} 106 - 5 {\texttimes} 1010 M{$\odot$}) using the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. While previous studies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we investigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration, size evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows drive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales via two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming, producing young stars that migrate {$\sim$}1 kpc within their first 100 Myr, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the global potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce several dramatic effects. First, galaxies' effective radii can fluctuate by factors of {$>$}2 over {$\sim$}200 Myr, and these rapid size fluctuations can account for much of the observed scatter in the radius at fixed Mstar. Second, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat stellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This age-dependent radial migration mixes---and even inverts---intrinsic age and metallicity gradients. Thus, the galactic-archaeology approach of calculating radial star formation histories from stellar populations at z = 0 can be severely biased. These effects are strongest at Mstar {$\approx$} 107-9.6 M{$\odot$}, the same regime where feedback most efficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of stellar kinematics in low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback models and test baryonic solutions to small-scale problems in {$\Lambda$}CDM.},

  abstract = {Fuzzy dark matter of ultralight axions has gained attention, largely in light of the galactic scale problems associated with cold dark matter. But the large de Broglie wavelength, believed to possibly alleviate these problems, also leads to fluctuations that place constraints on ultralight axions. We adapt and extend a method, previously devised to describe the effect of gaseous fluctuations on cold dark matter cusps, in order to determine the imprints of ultralight axion haloes on the motion of classical test particles. We first evaluate the effect of fluctuations in a statistically homogeneous medium of classical particles, then in a similar system of ultralight axions. In the first case, one recovers the classical two body relaxation time (and diffusion coefficients) from white noise density fluctuations. In the second situation, the fluctuations are not born of discreteness noise but from the finite de Broglie wavelength; correlation therefore exists over this scale, while white noise is retained on larger scales, elucidating the correspondence with classical relaxation. The resulting density power spectra and correlation functions are compared with those inferred from numerical simulations, and the relaxation time arising from the associated potential fluctuations is evaluated. We then apply our results to estimate the heating of discs embedded in axion dark haloes. We find that this implies an axion mass m {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}\{-22\} eV. We finally apply our model to the case of the central cluster of Eridanus II, confirming that far stronger constraints on m may in principle be obtained, and discussing the limitations associated with the assumptions leading to these.},

  abstract = {Star formation in galaxies is triggered by a combination of processes, including gravitational instabilities, spiral wave shocks, stellar compression, and turbulence compression. Some of these persist in the far outer regions, where the column density is far below the threshold for instabilities, making the outer disk cutoff somewhat gradual. We show that in a galaxy with a single exponential gas profile the star formation rate can have a double exponential, with a shallow one in the inner part and a steep one in the outer part. Such double exponentials have been observed recently in the broadband intensity profiles of spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies. The break radius in our model occurs slightly outside the threshold for instabilities, provided the Mach number for compressive motions remains of order unity to large radii. The ratio of the break radius to the inner exponential scale length increases for higher surface brightness disks because the unstable part extends farther out. This is also in agreement with observations. Galaxies with extended outer gas disks that fall more slowly than a single exponential, such as 1/R, can have their star formation rate scale approximately as a single exponential with radius, even out to 10 disk scale lengths. H{$\alpha$} profiles should drop much faster than the star formation rate as a result of the rapidly decreasing ambient density.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of cuspy cold dark matter (CDM) haloes in the gravitational potential of a massive host. Tidal mass-losses reshape CDM haloes, leaving behind bound remnants whose characteristic densities are set by the mean density of the host at the pericentre of their respective orbit. The evolution to the final bound remnant state is essentially complete after {\textasciitilde}5 orbits for nearly circular orbits, while reaching the same remnant requires, for the same pericentre, {\textasciitilde}25 and {\textasciitilde}40 orbits for eccentric orbits with 1:5 and 1:20 pericentre-to-apocentre ratios, respectively. The density profile of tidal remnants is fully specified by the fraction of mass lost, and approaches an exponentially truncated Navarro-Frenk-White profile in the case of heavy mass-loss. Resolving tidal remnants requires excellent numerical resolution; poorly resolved subhaloes have systematically lower characteristic densities and are more easily disrupted. Even simulations with excellent spatial and time resolution fail when the final remnant is resolved with fewer than 3000 particles. We derive a simple empirical model that describes the evolution of the mass and the density profile of the tidal remnant applicable to a wide range of orbital eccentricities and pericentric distances. Applied to the Milky Way, our results suggest that 108-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\$ haloes accreted \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ ago on 1:10 orbits with pericentric distance \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ should have been stripped to 0.1-1 per cent of their original mass. This implies that estimates of the survival and structure of such haloes (the possible hosts of ultra-faint Milky Way satellites) based on direct cosmological simulations may be subject to substantial revision.},

  abstract = {The clumpiness of dark matter on sub-kpc scales is highly sensitive to the tidal evolution and survival of subhaloes. In agreement with previous studies, we show that N-body realisations of cold dark matter subhaloes with centrally-divergent density cusps form artificial constant-density cores on the scale of the resolution limit of the simulation. These density cores drive the artificial tidal disruption of subhaloes. We run controlled simulations of the tidal evolution of a single subhalo where we repeatedly reconstruct the density cusp, preventing artificial disruption. This allows us to follow the evolution of the subhalo for arbitrarily large fractions of tidally stripped mass. Based on this numerical evidence in combination with simple dynamical arguments, we argue that cuspy dark matter subhaloes cannot be completely disrupted by smooth tidal fields. Modelling stars as collisionless tracers of the underlying potential, we furthermore study the tidal evolution of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using a model of the Tucana III dwarf as an example, we show that tides can strip dwarf galaxies down to sub-solar luminosities. The remnant micro-galaxies would appear as co-moving groups of metal-poor, low-mass stars of similar age, embedded in sub-kpc dark matter subhaloes.},

Given this close passage, we fit the Tucana III stream in the combined presence of the Milky Way and the LMC. We find that the predicted proper motions depend on the assumed mass of the LMC and that the LMC can induce a substantial proper motion perpendicular to the stream track. A detection of this misalignment will directly probe the extent of the LMC's influence on our Galaxy, and has implications for nearly all methods which attempt to constraint the Milky Way potential. Such a measurement will be possible with the upcoming Gaia DR2, allowing for a measurement of the LMC's mass.},

We argue that such a mismatch cannot arise due to any realistic static Milky Way potential and then explore the perturbative effects of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that the LMC can produce precisely, the observed motion-track mismatch and we therefore use the Orphan stream to measure the mass of the Cloud. We simultaneously fit the Milky Way and LMC potentials and infer that a total LMC mass of 1.38{\textasciicircum}\{+0.27\}\_\{-0.24\} {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} \{M\_{$\odot$} \} is required to bend the Orphan stream, showing for the first time that the LMC has a large and measurable effect on structures orbiting the Milky Way. This has far-reaching consequences for any technique which assumes that tracers are orbiting a static Milky Way. Furthermore, we measure the Milky Way mass within 50 kpc to be 3.80{\textasciicircum}\{+0.14\}\_\{-0.11\}{\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{$\odot$}.

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to model the tidal evolution of dark matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies embedded in cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White subhaloes. Tides gradually peel off stars and dark matter from a subhalo, trimming it down according to their initial binding energy. This process strips preferentially particles with long orbital times, and comes to an end when the remaining bound particles have crossing times shorter than a fraction of the orbital time at pericentre. The properties of the final stellar remnant thus depend on the energy distribution of stars in the progenitor subhalo, which in turn depends on the initial density profile and radial segregation of the initial stellar component. The stellar component may be completely dispersed if its energy distribution does not extend all the way to the subhalo potential minimum, although a bound dark remnant may remain. These results imply that 'tidally limited' galaxies, defined as systems whose stellar components have undergone substantial tidal mass-loss, neither converge to a unique structure nor follow a single tidal track. On the other hand, tidally limited dwarfs do have characteristic sizes and velocity dispersions that trace directly the characteristic radius (rmx) and circular velocity (Vmx) of the subhalo remnant. This result places strong upper limits on the size of satellites whose unusually low velocity dispersions are often ascribed to tidal effects. In particular, the large size of kinematically cold 'feeble giant' satellites like Crater 2 or Antlia 2 cannot be explained as due to tidal effects alone in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter scenario.},

With a stellar mass of \$16{\textasciicircum}\{+6\}\_\{-5\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and a half-light radius of \$3{\textbackslash}pm1\$ pc, it is either the darkest galaxy ever discovered or the faintest self-gravitating star cluster known to orbit the Galaxy. Its line-of-sight velocity dispersion suggests the presence of dark matter, although current measurements are inconclusive because of the unknown contribution to the dispersion of potential binary stars. We use N-body simulations to show that, if self-gravitating, the system could not survive in the Milky Way tidal field for more than a single orbit (roughly 0.4 Gyr), which strongly suggests that the system is stabilized by the presence of large amounts of dark matter. If UMa3/U1 formed at the centre of a {\textasciitilde}\$10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ cuspy LCDM halo, its velocity dispersion would be predicted to be of order {\textasciitilde}1 km/s. This is roughly consistent with the current estimate, which, neglecting binaries, places \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm los\}\$ in the range 1 to 4 km/s. Because of its dense cusp, such a halo should be able to survive the Milky Way tidal field, keeping UMa3/U1 relatively unscathed until the present time. This implies that UMa3/U1 is in all likelihood the faintest and densest dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, with important implications for alternative dark matter models, and for the minimum halo mass threshold for luminous galaxy formation in the LCDM cosmology.},

  abstract = {The cuspy central density profiles of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes make them highly resilient to disruption by tides. Self-interactions between dark matter particles, or the cycling of baryons, may result in the formation of a constant-density core that would make haloes more susceptible to tidal disruption. We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW)-like `cored' subhaloes in the tidal field of a massive host, and identify the criteria and time-scales for full disruption. Our results imply that the survival of Milky Way satellites places constraints on the sizes of dark matter cores. We find that no subhaloes with cores larger than 1~per\,cent of their initial NFW scale radius can survive for a Hubble time on orbits with pericentres \$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim\} 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$. A satellite like Tucana~3, with pericentre \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 3.5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$, must have a core size smaller than \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 2{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\$ to survive just three orbital periods on its current orbit. The core sizes expected in self-interacting dark matter models with a velocity-independent cross-section~of \$1{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm{\textasciicircum}2\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ seem incompatible with ultrafaint satellites with small pericentric radii, such as Tuc~3, Seg~1, Seg~2, Ret~2, Tri~2, and Wil~1, as these should have fully disrupted if accreted on to the Milky Way \$\{{\textbackslash}gtrsim\} 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ ago. These results suggest that many satellites have vanishingly small core sizes, consistent with CDM cusps. The discovery of further Milky Way satellites on orbits with small pericentric radii would strengthen these conclusions and allow for stricter upper limits on the core sizes.},

  abstract = {A fundamental prediction of the Lambda cold dark matter cosmology is the centrally divergent cuspy density profile of dark matter haloes. Density cusps render cold dark matter haloes resilient to tides, and protect dwarf galaxies embedded in them from full tidal disruption. The hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way may therefore give rise to a population of "microgalaxies"; i.e., heavily stripped remnants of early accreted satellites, which can reach arbitrarily low luminosity. Assuming that the progenitor systems are dark matter dominated, we use an empirical formalism for tidal stripping to predict the evolution of the luminosity, size, and velocity dispersion of such remnants, tracing their tidal evolution across multiple orders of magnitude in mass and size. The evolutionary tracks depend sensitively on the progenitor distribution of stellar binding energies. We explore three cases that likely bracket most realistic models of dwarf galaxies: one where the energy distribution of the most tightly bound stars follows that of the dark matter, and two where stars are defined by either an exponential density or surface brightness profile. The tidal evolution in the size--velocity dispersion plane is quite similar for these three models, although their remnants may differ widely in luminosity. Microgalaxies are therefore best distinguished from globular clusters by the presence of dark matter; either directly, by measuring their velocity dispersion, or indirectly, by examining their tidal resilience. Our work highlights the need for further theoretical and observational constraints on the stellar energy distribution in dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract = {We study the response of mono-energetic stellar populations with initially isotropic kinematics to impulsive and adiabatic changes to an underlying dark matter potential. Half-light radii expand and velocity dispersions decrease as enclosed dark matter is removed. The details of this expansion and cooling depend on the time scale on which the underlying potential changes. In the adiabatic regime, the product of half-light radius and average velocity dispersion is conserved. We show that the stellar populations maintain centrally isotropic kinematics throughout their adiabatic evolution, and their densities can be approximated by a family of analytical radial profiles. Metallicity gradients within the galaxy flatten as dark matter is slowly removed. In the case of strong impulsive perturbations, stellar populations develop power-law-like density tails with radially biased kinematics. We show that the distribution of stellar binding energies within the dark matter halo substantially widens after an impulsive perturbation, no matter the sign of the perturbation. This allows initially energetically separated stellar populations to mix, to the extent that previously chemo-dynamically distinct populations may masquerade as a single population with large metallicity and energy spread. Finally, we show that in response to an impulsive perturbation, stellar populations that are deeply embedded in cored dark matter halos undergo a series of damped oscillations before reaching a virialised equilibrium state, driven by inefficient phase mixing in the harmonic potentials of cored halos. This slow return to equilibrium adds substantial systematic uncertainty to dynamical masses estimated from Jeans modeling or the virial theorem.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of stellar mass segregation driven by collisional relaxation within the potential well of a smooth dark matter halo. This effect is of particular relevance for old stellar systems with short crossing times, where small collisional perturbations accumulate over many dynamical time scales. We run collisional \$N\$-body simulations tailored to the ambiguous stellar systems Ursa Major 3/Unions 1, Delve 1 and Eridanus 3, modelling their stellar populations as two-component systems of high- and low-mass stars, respectively. For Ursa Major 3/Unions 1 (Delve 1), assuming a dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of 10, we find that after 10 Gyr of evolution, the radial extent of its low-mass stars will be twice as large (40 per cent larger) than that of its high-mass stars. We show that weak tides do not alter this relative separation of half-light radii, whereas for the case of strong tidal fields, mass segregation facilitates the tidal stripping of low-mass stars. We further find that as the population of high-mass stars contracts and cools, the number of dynamically formed binaries within that population increases. Our results call for caution when using stellar mass segregation as a criterion to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies, and suggest that mass segregation increases the abundance of massive binaries in the central regions of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract = {The radial profile of the Sculptor dwarf elliptical galaxy has been determined from automated star counts of UK Schmidt Telescope Unit (UKSTU) plates. The ellipticity (e = 0.34 +/- 0.04) and position angle (P.A.(1950.0) = 95.4{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} +/- 4.3{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum}) are in agreement with those determined by Hodge (1961b). These profiles have been compared with King (1966) models with a range of tidal and core radii. None have been found to give an excellent fit. The best fit achieved has r\_t\_ = 95' and r\_c\_ = 8.9', and has a standard deviation of {$\sigma$} = 0.28 and {$\chi$}{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} = 0.71 (indicating a 95+ \% confidence limit). Accepting these as roughly the correct values for the core and tidal radii, and using other data from the literature, the mass of the Galaxy has been estimated as M\_G\_{\textasciitilde}1.5 +/- 1.1 X 10{\textasciicircum}11{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_. However, the data deviate from this model significantly at large radii, there is an observed overdensity above that expected for the King model beyond R\_maj\_ = 50'. This overdensity is roughly a 2{$\sigma$} effect above the determined background level, and accounts for {\textasciitilde}13\% of the stars counted. This compares well with the results of Innanen and Papp (1979) that {\textasciitilde}10\% of Sculptor's variable stars are found beyond R\_maj\_=53' (Hodge's 1961b value for r\_t\_). Exponential law fits have also been made, following the suggestion (Faber and Lin 1983) that the halo dwarfs are as well fit by exponential laws as are many disk systems. The mean best fit has an exponential scale of {$\gamma$}= -0.053 +/- 0.001 arcmin{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, with a standard deviation of {$\sigma$}= 0.51 and {$\chi$}{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} = 3.8 (still a 95\% + confidence limit). Given the distance modulus of Kunkel and Demers (1977), this implies a physical scale length of r\_e\_{\textasciitilde}0.43 kpc. While the data show the same excess with respect to the exponential law fits as found for the King model fits, this excess is not more severe than is seen in many disk systems. The current data, therefore, do not argue against the hypothesis that the halo dwarfs are the results of ram-pressure stripping of dI systems by the Galactic halo.},

  abstract = {The two-dimensional structure of the Sculptor dwarf elliptical galaxy has been investigated using automated starcounts from United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope Unit (UKSTU) plates. The overall shape of the 2-D contours is similar to that obtained by Hodge (1961b). The existence of nonsymmetric structure in Sculptor has been probed by fitting the starcount data with smooth, symmetric, concentric elliptical contours, then subtracting these fits from the actual data and examining the residual maps. Significant asymmetries are found in the data from all plates, with a maximum density contrast of {\textasciitilde} + 30\% above what is expected for a symmetric fit. All the structure clearly detected is at distances less than or on the order of the core radius. These structures have a physical size of {\textasciitilde}150 pc, and a core crossing time of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8{\textasciicircum} yr. This would seem to imply that they are either bound, or are very young structures. It is possible, however, that they are remnant high-energy star groups, of the sort conjectured by Hodge and Michie (1969), left over from the formation epoch of the system. Calculations following work by Tremaine (1981) indicate that the structures seen should have a decay time due to interaction with the Sculptor core of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10{\textasciicircum} yr, which is roughly the apparent age of the bulk of Sculptor stars (DaCosta 1984). An estimate of the current ratio of kinetic to potential energy for these structures reinforces the supposition that they are currently dissipating in the tidal field of the Sculptor core.},

  abstract = {In simulations of the standard cosmological model ({$\Lambda$}CDM), dark matter halos are aspherical. However, so far the asphericity of an individual galaxy's halo has never been robustly established. We use the Jeans equations to define a quantity that robustly characterizes a deviation from rotational symmetry. This quantity is essentially the gravitational torque and it roughly provides the ellipticity projected along the line of sight. We show that the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), with a single epoch of observations combined with those of the Gaia Space Telescope, can distinguish the {$\Lambda$}CDM value of the torque from zero for each Sculptor-like dwarf galaxy with a confidence between 0 and 5{$\sigma$}, depending on the orientation of each halo. With two epochs of observations, TMT will achieve a 5{$\sigma$} discovery of torque and thus asphericity for most such galaxies, thus providing a new and powerful test of the {$\Lambda$}CDM model.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations within a cold dark matter (DM) cosmology form haloes whose density profiles have a steep inner slope ('cusp'), yet observations of galaxies often point towards a flat central 'core'. We develop a convolutional mixture density neural network model to derive a probability density function (PDF) of the inner density slopes of DM haloes. We train the network on simulated dwarf galaxies from the NIHAO and AURIGA projects, which include both DM cusps and cores: line-of-sight velocities and 2D spatial distributions of their stars are used as inputs to obtain a PDF representing the probability of predicting a specific inner slope. The model recovers accurately the expected DM profiles: \${\textbackslash}sim 82\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the galaxies have a derived inner slope within {\textpm}0.1 of their true value, while \${\textbackslash}sim 98\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ within {\textpm}0.3. We apply our model to four Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies and find results consistent with those obtained with the Jeans modelling based code GRAVSPHERE: the Fornax dSph has a strong indication of possessing a central DM core, Carina and Sextans have cusps (although the latter with large uncertainties), while Sculptor shows a double peaked PDF indicating that a cusp is preferred, but a core cannot be ruled out. Our results show that simulation-based inference with neural networks provide a innovative and complementary method for the determination of the inner matter density profiles in galaxies, which in turn can help constrain the properties of the elusive DM.},

  abstract = {Context. The third Gaia data release is published in two stages. The early part, Gaia EDR3, gives very precise astrometric and photometric properties for nearly two billion sources together with seven million radial velocities from Gaia DR2. The full release, Gaia DR3, will add radial velocities, spectra, light curves, and astrophysical parameters for a large subset of the sources, as well as orbits for solar system objects. Aims: Before the publication of the catalogue, many different data items have undergone dedicated validation processes. The goal of this paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness, accuracy, and precision for the Gaia EDR3 data and to provide recommendations for the use of the catalogue data. Methods: The validation processes include a systematic analysis of the catalogue contents to detect anomalies, either individual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis and comparisons to the previous release as well as to external data and to models. Results: Gaia EDR3 represents a major step forward, compared to Gaia DR2, in terms of precision, accuracy, and completeness for both astrometry and photometry. We provide recommendations for dealing with issues related to the parallax zero point, negative parallaxes, photometry for faint sources, and the quality indicators.},

They are based on more than 2200 low-resolution spectra collected with VIMOS at Very Large Telescope (VLT). The targets are faint (20 {$\lessequivlnt$} V {$\lessequivlnt$} 21.5 mag), but the accuracy at the faintest limit is {$\leq$}9 km s-1. These data were complemented with RV measurements either based on spectra collected with FORS2 and FLAMES/GIRAFFE at VLT or available in the literature. We ended up with a sample of 2748 stars and among them, 1389 are candidate Carina stars. We found that the intermediate-age stellar component shows a well-defined rotational pattern around the minor axis. The western and the eastern side of the galaxy differ by +5 and -4 km s-1 when compared with the main RV peak. The old stellar component is characterized by a larger RV dispersion and does not show evidence of the RV pattern. We compared the observed RV distribution with N-body simulations for a former disky dwarf galaxy orbiting a giant Milky Way-like galaxy. We rotated the simulated galaxy by 60{$^\circ$} with respect to the major axis, we kept the observer on the orbital plane of the dwarf and extracted a sample of stars similar to the observed one. Observed and predicted \{V\}\{rot\}/{$\sigma$} ratios across the central regions are in remarkable agreement. This evidence indicates that Carina was a disky dwarf galaxy that experienced several strong tidal interactions with the Milky Way. Owing to these interactions, Carina transformed from a disky to a prolate spheroid and the rotational velocity transformed into random motions.},

This seems at odds with the relatively high frequency of pairings among dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. We use literature data to show that {$\sim$}30 per cent of all the satellites of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies brighter than MV = -8 are found in likely physical pairs of comparable luminosity. Besides the previously recognized pairings of the Magellanic Clouds and of NGC 147/NGC 185, other candidate pairs include the Ursa Minor and Draco dwarf spheroidals, as well as the And I/And III satellites of M31. These pairs are much closer than expected by chance if the radial and angular distributions of satellites were uncorrelated; in addition, they have very similar line-of-sight velocities and luminosities that differ by less than three magnitudes. In contrast, the same criteria pair fewer than 4 per cent of satellites in N-body/semi-analytic models that match the radial distribution and luminosity function of Local Group satellites. If confirmed in studies of larger samples, the high frequency of dwarf galaxy pairings may provide interesting clues to the formation of faint galaxies in the current cosmological paradigm.},

  abstract = {The shallow faint-end slope of the galaxy mass function is usually reproduced in {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) galaxy formation models by assuming that the fraction of baryons that turn into stars drops steeply with decreasing halo mass and essentially vanishes in haloes with maximum circular velocities Vmax {$<$} 20-30 km s-1. Dark-matter-dominated dwarfs should therefore have characteristic velocities of about that value, unless they are small enough to probe only the rising part of the halo circular velocity curve (i.e. half-mass radii, r1/2 {$\ll$} 1 kpc). Many dwarfs have properties in disagreement with this prediction: they are large enough to probe their halo Vmax but their characteristic velocities are well below 20 km s-1. These 'cold faint giants' (an extreme example is the recently discovered Crater 2 Milky Way satellite) can only be reconciled with our {$\Lambda$}CDM models if they are the remnants of once massive objects heavily affected by tidal stripping. We examine this possibility using the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group. Assuming that low-velocity-dispersion satellites have been affected by stripping, we infer their progenitor masses, radii, and velocity dispersions, and find them in remarkable agreement with those of isolated dwarfs. Tidal stripping also explains the large scatter in the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation in the dwarf galaxy regime: tides remove preferentially dark matter from satellite galaxies, lowering their accelerations below the amin {\textasciitilde} 10-11 m s-2 minimum expected for isolated dwarfs. In many cases, the resulting velocity dispersions are inconsistent with the predictions from Modified Newtonian Dynamics, a result that poses a possibly insurmountable challenge to that scenario.},

  abstract = {According to the current cosmological paradigm, ``Lambda Cold Dark Matter'' (LambdaCDM), only {\textasciitilde}20\% of the gravitating matter in the universe is made up of ordinary (i.e. baryonic) matter, while the rest consists of invisible dark matter (DM) particles, which existence can be inferred from their gravitational influence on baryonic matter and light. Despite the large success of the LambdaCDM model in explaining the large scale structure of the Universe and the conditions of the early Universe, there has been debate on whether this model can fully explain the observations of low mass (dwarf) galaxies. The Local Group (LG), which hosts most of the known dwarf galaxies, is a unique laboratory to test the predictions of the LambdaCDM model on small scales. I analyze the kinematics of LG members, including the Milky{\textasciitilde}Way-Andromeda (MW-M31) pair and dwarf galaxies, in order to constrain the mass of the LG. I construct samples of LG analogs from large cosmological N-body simulations, according to the following kinematics constraints: (a) the separation and relative velocity of the MW-M31 pair; (b) the receding velocity of dwarf galaxies in the outskirts of the LG. I find that these constraints yield a median total mass of 2*10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} solar masses for the MW and M31, but with a large uncertainty. Based on the mass and the kinematics constraints, I select twelve LG candidates for the APOSTLE simulations project. The APOSTLE project consists of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the LG candidates, using the EAGLE galaxy formation model. I show that dwarf satellites of MW and M31 analogs in APOSTLE are in good agreement with observations, in terms of number, luminosity and kinematics. There have been tensions between the observed masses of LG dwarf spheroidals and the predictions of N-body simulations within the LambdaCDM framework; simulations tend to over-predict the mass of dwarfs. This problem is known as the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem. I find that the enclosed mass within the half-light radii of Galactic classical dwarf spheroidals, is in excellent agreement with the simulated satellites in APOSTLE, and that there is no too-big-to-fail problem in APOSTLE simulations. A few factors contribute in solving the problem: (a) the mass of haloes in hydrodynamical simulations are lower compared to their N-body counterparts; (b) stellar mass-halo mass relation in APOSTLE is different than the ones used to argue for the too-big-to-fail problem; (c) number of massive satellites correlates with the virial mass of the host, i.e. MW analogs with virial masses above {\textasciitilde} 3*10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} solar masses would have faced too-big-to-fail problems; (d) uncertainties in observations were underestimated in previous works. Stellar mass-halo mass relation in APOSTLE predicts that all isolated dwarf galaxies should live in haloes with maximum circular velocity (V\_max) above 20 km/s. Satellite galaxies, however, can inhabit lower mass haloes due to tidal stripping which removes mass from the inner regions of satellites as they orbit their hosts. I examine all satellites of the MW and M31, and find that many of them live in haloes less massive than V\_max=20 km/s. I additionally show that the low mass population is following a different trend in stellar mass-size relation compared to the rest of the satellites or field dwarfs. I use stellar mass-halo mass relation of APOSTLE field galaxies, along with tidal stripping trajectories derived in Penarrubia et al., in order to predict the properties of the progenitors of the LG satellites. According to this prediction, some satellites have lost a significant amount of dark matter as well as stellar mass. Cra{\textasciitilde}II, And{\textasciitilde}XIX, XXI, and XXV have lost 99 per-cent of their stellar mass in the past. I show that the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation of dwarf galaxies in the LG is at odds with MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predictions, whereas tidal stripping can explain the observations very well. I compare observed velocity dispersion of LG satellites with the predicted values by MOND. The observations and MOND predictions are inconsistent, in particular in the regime of ultra faint dwarf galaxies.},

By means of N-body simulations, we follow the evolution of possible progenitor galaxies of Bootes for a variety of orbits in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way. The progenitors considered cover the range from dark matter-free star clusters to massive, dark matter-dominated outcomes of cosmological simulations. For each type of progenitor and orbit, we compare the observable properties of the remnant after 10 Gyr with those of Bootes observed today. Our study suggests that the progenitor of Bootes must have been, and remains now, dark matter-dominated. In general, our models are unable to reproduce the observed high velocity dispersion in Bootes without dark matter. Our models do not support time-dependent tidal effects as a mechanism able to inflate significantly the internal velocity dispersion. As none of our initially spherical models is able to reproduce the elongation of Bootes, our results suggest that the progenitor of Bootes may have had some intrinsic flattening. Although the focus of this paper is the Bootes dwarf spheroidal, these models may be of general relevance to understanding the structure, stability and dark matter content of all dwarf spheroidal galaxies.},

The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/.

  abstract = {We present deep optical observations of the stellar halo of NGC 300, an LMC-mass galaxy, acquired with the DEEP subcomponent of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey using the 4 m Blanco Telescope. Our resolved star analysis reveals a large, low surface brightness stellar stream (MV {$\sim$} -8.5; [Fe/H] = -1.4 {\textpm} 0.15) extending more than 40 kpc north from the galaxy's center. We also find other halo structures, including potentially an additional stream wrap to the south, which may be associated with the main stream. The morphology and derived low metallicities of the streams and shells discovered surrounding NGC 300 are highly suggestive of a past accretion event. Assuming a single progenitor, the accreted system is approximately Fornax-like in luminosity, with an inferred mass ratio to NGC 300 of approximately 1:15. We also present the discovery of a metal-poor globular cluster (GC) (Rproj = 23.3 kpc; MV = -8.99 {\textpm} 0.16; [Fe/H] {$\approx$} -1.6 {\textpm} 0.6) in the halo of NGC 300, the furthest identified GC associated with NGC 300. The stellar structures around NGC 300 represent the richest features observed in a Magellanic Cloud analog to date, strongly supporting the idea that accretion and subsequent disruption is an important mechanism in the assembly of dwarf galaxy stellar halos.},

  abstract = {We present a suite of 15 cosmological zoom-in simulations of isolated dark matter haloes, all with masses of Mhalo {$\approx$} 1010\,M{$\odot$} at z~=~0, in order to understand the relationship among halo assembly, galaxy formation and feedback's effects on the central density structure in dwarf galaxies. These simulations are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (fire) project and are performed at extremely high resolution (mbaryon~=~500\,M{$\odot$}, mdm~=~2500\,M{$\odot$}). The resultant galaxies have stellar masses that are consistent with rough abundance matching estimates, coinciding with the faintest galaxies that can be seen beyond the virial radius of the Milky Way (M*/M{$\odot$} {$\approx$} 105~-~107). This non-negligible spread in stellar mass at z~=~0 in haloes within a narrow range of virial masses is strongly correlated with central halo density or maximum circular velocity Vmax, both of which are tightly linked to halo formation time. Much of this dependence of M* on a second parameter (beyond Mhalo) is a direct consequence of the Mhalo~{$\sim~$}1010\,M{$\odot$} mass scale coinciding with the threshold for strong reionization suppression: the densest, earliest-forming haloes remain above the UV-suppression scale throughout their histories while late-forming systems fall below the UV-suppression scale over longer periods and form fewer stars as a result. In fact, the latest-forming, lowest-concentration halo in our suite fails to form any stars. Haloes that form galaxies with M{$\star$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2 {\texttimes} 106\,M{$\odot$} have reduced central densities relative to dark-matter-only simulations, and the radial extent of the density modifications is well-approximated by the galaxy half-mass radius r1/2. Lower-mass galaxies do not modify their host dark matter haloes at the mass scale studied here. This apparent stellar mass threshold of M{$\star$} {$\approx$} 2 {\texttimes} 106 - 2 {\texttimes} 10- 4\,Mhalo is broadly consistent with previous work and provides a testable prediction of fire feedback models in {$\Lambda$}cold dark matter.},

  abstract = {We examine the nature of the progenitor of the giant stellar stream in M31 using as constraints new radial velocity measurements of stream red giant stars (presented in the companion paper by Guhathakurta and coworkers) along with other M31 data sets available in the literature. We find that the observations are best fitted by orbits that are highly eccentric and close to edge-on, with apocenter to pericenter ratios on the order of 25-30 and with apocenters at or only slightly beyond the southern edge of the current data. Among these orbits we are able to find a few that plausibly connect the stream with the northern spur or with the low surface brightness feature of high metallicity similar to that of the stream (originally reported by Ferguson and coworkers) to the east of M31's center. In the latter case, if the connection is real, then the eastern debris should lie well in front of M31, near the apocenter of the orbit. Both the width of the debris and velocity dispersion measurements imply a rough lower limit on the mass of the progenitor of 108 Msolar. We use this limit and our orbits to discuss which of M31's satellites could be plausibly associated with the stream. In addition, we predict that the width of the stream should increase beyond the southern edge of the current data around the apocenter of the orbit and that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion should exhibit significant variations along the stream.},

  abstract = {Andromeda II (And II) has been known for a few decades but only recently observations have unveiled new properties of this dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The presence of two stellar populations, the bimodal star formation history (SFH) and an unusual rotation velocity of And II put strong constrains on its formation and evolution. Following {\L}okas et al., we propose a detailed model to explain the main properties of And II involving (1) a gas-rich major merger between two dwarf galaxies at high redshift in the field and (2) a close interaction with M31 about 5 Gyr ago. The model is based on N-body/hydrodynamical simulations including gas dynamics, star formation and feedback. One simulation is designed to reproduce the gas-rich major merger explaining the origin of stellar populations and the SFH. Other simulations are used to study the effects of tidal forces and the ram-pressure stripping during the interaction between And II and M31. The model successfully reproduces the SFH of And II including the properties of stellar populations, its morphology, kinematics and the lack of gas. Further improvements to the model are possible via joint modelling of all processes and better treatment of baryonic physics.},

  abstract = {Surface photometry shows that most spiral and S0 galaxies have two main components: a spheroidal component, and an exponential disk component with radial surface-brightness distribution 1(R) = Ioe 5. The exponential disk is the subject of this paper. First, for the exponential disk in centrifugal equilibrium with surface density (R) = , we derive the circular-velocity field and the mass- angular momentum distribution (h); (h) is the total mass with angular momentum per unit mass less than h. (h) for the exponential disk is almost identical with (k) for a family of rigidly rotating spheres of uniform density. We then collect photometric data for the disks of thirty-six spiral and S0 galaxies, and find the following: (i) Twenty-eight of the thirty-six galaxies have approximately the same intensity scale 1o (21.65 B-mag per square second of arc), with a standard deviation of only 0.30 mag per square second of arc, despite a range of nearly 5 mag in absolute magnitude. This constancy of 1o produces the correlation between apparent magnitude and angular diameter found by Hubble. (ii) S0-Sbc systems have any value of the disk length scale between 1 and 5 kpc, while later-type systems have predominantly low values of a ({$<$}2 kpc). (iii) The relative brightness and size of the spheroidal and disk components are only weakly with morphological type. If conclusion (i) implies that s is approximately constant, then the disk's total mass and angular momentum satisfy 7/4 If (h) is invariant as a protogalaxy collapses to form a galaxy, then all protogalaxies destined to be S0 or spiral galaxies have a similar (h) (in dimensionless variables), at least for the range of h corresponding to the disk. If (k) is not invariant, then there exists a very efficient mechanism which establishes the characteristic ) (h) for these systems as they form. The exponential nature of the disk is not defined by i) alone; its cause remains uncertain.},

  abstract = {Supernova and multiple supernova events regulate several structural properties of dwarf galaxies. In particular, they govern the metal enrichment and the energy budget of the ISM; they might induce partial (blowout) or total (blowaway) gas removal from the galaxy; they also regulate the pressure of the ISM, and consequently the morphology of the galactic gaseous body. Significant amounts of dark matter may play an equally important role: the dark matter gravitational potential tends to concentrate baryons towards the centre, thus enhancing both the star formation rate and the metal production. Also, the dynamical properties of the ISM, and the occurrence of a blowout or blowaway, are shown to be determined by the dark matter content. We present detailed analytical/numerical models describing the evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIs), including the above and other effects. The main results are: (i) dwarfs with total masses M{$\lessequivlnt$}5{\texttimes}106 M{$\odot$} are blown away; those with gas masses up to {$\simeq$}109 M{$\odot$} lose mass in an outflow; (ii) metallicities are found to correlate tightly with dark matter content, and are consistent with a range of dark-to-visible mass ratios {$\varphi\approx$}0--30, with about 65 per cent of the dwarfs in the sample having {$\varphi\approx$}0--10; (iii) we predict a lower limit to the oxygen abundance in dIs of 12+log(O/H){$\approx$}7.2; (iv) outflows are not particularly important for the metallicity evolution of dwarf galaxies, and certainly less important than star formation for gas consumption; however, dwarfs with gas masses of a few {\texttimes}108 M{$\odot$} are shown to be the major pollutants of the IGM; (v) the ISM H i velocity dispersion correlates with metallicity and, independently of dark matter, scales as Z3.5. Specific comparisons with well-studied dIs, such as for example Leo A, yield excellent agreement with the data. Based on our results, we discuss a scenario in which late-type and early-type dwarfs had common progenitors in the past, but differences in their total mass forced these objects to follow different evolutionary paths. We therefore consider dI{$\rightarrow$}dE transitions occurring at present cosmic times as very unlikely.},

  abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here, we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in time-scales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial condition generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (GBP - GRP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, GBP, and GRP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, GBP, and GRP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

  abstract = {Context. We present the third data release of the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, Gaia DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of Gaia sources. Aims: We outline the content and the properties of Gaia DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release. Methods: The Gaia DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. Results: The Gaia DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G, GBP, and GRP pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, Gaia EDR3. Gaia DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges GRVS {$<$} 14 and 3100 {$<$} Teff {$<$} 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide GRVS magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community. The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. Gaia DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy. Conclusions: This data release represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in Gaia DR3 will unleash the full potential of Gaia's exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.},

  abstract = {The Wisconsin H{$\alpha$} Mapper has been used to set the first deep upper limits on the intensity of diffuse H{$\alpha$} emission from warm ionized gas in the Draco and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Assuming a velocity dispersion of 15 km s-1 for the ionized gas, we set limits of IH{$\alpha<$}=0.024 R and IH{$\alpha<$}=0.021 R for the Draco and Ursa Minor dSphs, respectively, averaged over our 1{$^\circ$} circular beam. Adopting a simple model for the ionized interstellar medium, these limits translate to upper bounds on the mass of ionized gas of {$<$}{\textasciitilde}10\% of the stellar mass, or {\textasciitilde}10 times the upper limits for the mass of neutral hydrogen. Note that the Draco and Ursa Minor dSphs could contain substantial amounts of interstellar gas, equivalent to all of the gas injected by dying stars since the end of their main star-forming episodes {$>$}{\textasciitilde}8 Gyr in the past, without violating these limits on the mass of ionized gas.},

We discuss the present observational data and their implications for theories of the formation and evolution of both dwarf and giant galaxies. The putative dark matter content of these low-surface-brightness systems is of particular interest, as is their chemical evolution. Surveys for new dwarf spheroidals hidden behind the stars of our Galaxy and those which are not bound to giant galaxies may give new clues as to the origins of this unique class of galaxy.

  abstract = {Satellite galaxies are predicted to generate gravitational density wakes as they orbit within the dark matter (DM) halos of their hosts, causing their orbits to decay over time. The recent infall of the Milky Way's (MW) most massive satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), affords us the unique opportunity to study this process in action. In this work, we present high-resolution (m dm = 4 {\texttimes} 104 M {$\odot$}) N-body simulations of the MW-LMC interaction over the past 2 Gyr. We quantify the impact of the LMC's passage on the density and kinematics of the MW's DM halo and the observability of these structures in the MW's stellar halo. The LMC is found to generate a pronounced wake, which we decompose in Transient and Collective responses, in both the DM and stellar halos. The wake leads to overdensities and distinct kinematic patterns that should be observable with ongoing and future surveys. Specifically, the Collective response will result in redshifted radial velocities of stars in the north and blueshifts in the south, at distances {$>$}45 kpc. The Transient response traces the orbital path of the LMC through the halo (50-200 kpc), resulting in a stellar overdensity with a distinct, tangential kinematic pattern that persists to the present day. The detection of the MW's halo response will constrain the infall mass of the LMC, its orbital trajectory, and the mass of the MW, and it may inform us about the nature of the DM particle itself.},

  abstract = {Indications of disequilibrium throughout the Milky Way (MW) highlight the need for compact, flexible, non-parametric descriptions of phase-space distributions of galaxies. We present a new representation of the current dark matter (DM) distribution and potential derived from N-body simulations of the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) system using basis function expansions (BFEs). We incorporate methods to maximize the physical signal in the representation. As a result, the simulations of 108 DM particles representing the distorted MW(MW+LMC) system can be described by {\textasciitilde}236(2067) coefficients. We find that the LMC induces asymmetric perturbations (odd l, m) to the MW's halo, which are inconsistent with oblate, prolate, or triaxial halos. Furthermore, the energy in high order even modes (l, m {$>$} 2) is similar to average triaxial halos found in cosmological simulations. As such, the response of the MW's halo to the LMC must be accounted for in order to recover the imprints of its assembly history. The LMC causes the outer halo ({$>$}30 kpc) to shift from the disk center of mass (COM) by {\textasciitilde}15-25 kpc at present day, manifesting as a dipole in the BFE and in the radial velocities of halo stars. The shift depends on the LMC's infall mass, the distortion of the LMC's halo and the MW halo response.Within 30 kpc, halo tracers are expected to orbit the COM of the MW's disk, regardless of LMC infall mass. The LMC's halo is also distorted by MW tides; we discuss the implications for its mass loss and the subsequent effects on current Magellanic satellites.},

  abstract = {We investigate the hypothesized tidal disruption of the Hercules ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). Previous tidal disruption studies of the Hercules UFD have been hindered by the high degree of foreground contamination in the direction of the dwarf. We bypass this issue by using RR Lyrae stars, which are standard candles with a very low field-volume density at the distance of Hercules. We use wide-field imaging from the Dark Energy Camera on CTIO to identify candidate RR Lyrae stars, supplemented with observations taken in coordination with the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey on the Bok Telescope. Combining color, magnitude, and light-curve information, we identify three new RR Lyrae stars associated with Hercules. All three of these new RR Lyrae stars lie outside its published tidal radius. When considered with the nine RR Lyrae stars already known within the tidal radius, these results suggest that a substantial fraction of Hercules' stellar content has been stripped. With this degree of tidal disruption, Hercules is an interesting case between a visibly disrupted dwarf (such as the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy) and one in dynamic equilibrium. The degree of disruption also shows that we must be more careful with the ways we determine object membership when estimating dwarf masses in the future. One of the three discovered RR Lyrae stars sits along the minor axis of Hercules, but over two tidal radii away. This type of debris is consistent with recent models that suggest Hercules' orbit is aligned with its minor axis.},

The 3.6 {$\mu$}m observations have been acquired with the Infrared Array Camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of the SMHASH program. Mid-infrared light curves for 42 RRLs were obtained, from which we measured Sculptor's distance modulus to be {$\mu$} = 19.60 {\textpm} 0.02 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.04 (photometric) mag (with {$\sigma$}sys = 0.09 mag), using the 3.6 {$\mu$}m empirical period-luminosity relations derived from the Galactic globular cluster M4, or {$\mu$} = 19.57 {\textpm} 0.02 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.04 (photometric) mag (with {$\sigma$}sys = 0.11 mag) using empirical relations in the same passband recently derived from the Large Magellanic Cloud globular cluster Reticulum. Both these measurements are in good agreement with values presented in previous works with Sculptor RRLs in optical bands, and are also consistent with recent near-infrared RR Lyrae results. Best agreement with the literature is found for the latter modulus which is equivalent to a distance of d = 82 {\textpm} 1 (statistical) {\textpm} 2 (photometric) kpc (with {$\sigma$}sys = 4 kpc). Finally, using a subsample of RRLs with spectroscopic metallicities, we demonstrate that these distance estimates are not affected by metallicity effects.},

  abstract = {Aims. We used RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia third data release (DR3) to explore the outskirts of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) and update the census of its variable star population. Methods. We adopted different tools based on the Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data (proper motions, Period--Wesenheit--Metallicity relations, spatial distribution, colour--magnitude diagram and stellar isochrone fitting) to discriminate between different types of variable stars, and to identify UMi members. Results. We found a total of 129 RR Lyrae stars and 10 Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) that belong to UMi. In this paper we report 47 new RR Lyrae stars (46 bona fide and 1 candidate) and 5 new ACs (4 bona fide and 1 candidate), including new possible members in the extreme periphery of the galaxy at a distance of {$\sim$}12 half-light radii. We reclassified 13 RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study pipeline for Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS Cep\&RRL), using data from the literature and Gaia astrometry and photometry. Specifically, we assigned these 13 DR3 RR Lyrae stars to ten Anomalous Cepheids and three doublemode RR Lyrae (RRd), respectively. From the average luminosity of the RR Lyrae stars we derive for UMi a distance modulus of (m - M)0 = 19.23 {\textpm} 0.11 mag, in excellent agreement with the literature. Finally, we investigated whether some of UMi's variable stars might be members of the ultra-faint stellar cluster Mu{\~n}oz 1 that lies at a projected distance of 45' from UMi's centre. Based on the properties of the variable stars (distances, colours, and metallicities), we find it unlikely that they belong to the cluster.},

The suite contains 48 Galaxy-size haloes, each within high-resolution volumes that span 2-5 Mpc in size, and each resolving thousands of systems with masses below the atomic cooling limit. Half of the ELVIS galaxy haloes are in paired configurations similar to the Milky Way (MW) and M31; the other half are isolated, mass-matched analogues. We find no difference in the abundance or kinematics of substructure within the virial radii of isolated versus paired hosts. On Mpc scales, however, LG-like pairs average almost twice as many companions and the velocity field is kinematically hotter and more complex. We present a refined abundance matching relation between stellar mass and halo mass that reproduces the observed satellite stellar mass functions of the MW and M31 down to the regime where incompleteness is an issue, M* {$\sim$} 5 {\texttimes} 105 M{$\odot$}. Within a larger region spanning approximately 3 Mpc, the same relation predicts that there should be {$\sim$}1000 galaxies with M* {$>$} 103 M{$\odot$} awaiting discovery. We show that up to 50 per cent of haloes within 1 Mpc of the MW or M31 could be systems that have previously been within the virial radius of either giant. By associating never accreted haloes with gas-rich dwarfs, we show that there are plausibly 50 undiscovered dwarf galaxies with H I masses {$>$}105 M{$\odot$} within the local volume. The radial velocity distribution of these predicted gas-rich dwarfs can be used to inform follow-up searches based on ultracompact high-velocity clouds found in the ALFALFA survey.},

  abstract = {The existence of two kinematically and chemically distinct stellar subpopulations in the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies offers the opportunity to constrain the density profile of their matter haloes by measuring the mass contained within the well-separated half-light radii of the two metallicity subpopulations. Walker and Pe{\~n}arrubia have used this approach to argue that data for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their inner regions and rule out `cuspy' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high statistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor. We test the validity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment) {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all have NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct metallicity subpopulations reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a method analogous to that of Walker and Pe{\~n}arrubia to a sample of 50 simulated dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although multiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based. The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different asphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the density profile are inferred depending on the angle from which the galaxy is viewed.},

  abstract = {A number of Local Group dwarf galaxies are known to have two spatially segregated stellar metallicity populations, a centrally concentrated metal-rich population, and a more extended metal-poor population. In this work we discuss mechanisms that lead to the formation of two spatially segregated metallicity populations. Using a set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of Local Group-like environments, we select a sample of satellite and field galaxies, spanning the stellar mass range 106-109 M{$\odot$}, that exhibit bimodality in their metallicity distributions. Among those, we identify a subsample with a strong spatial segregation in the two populations. We find three distinct mechanisms for their formation. In field dwarfs and in a small fraction of satellites, a merger causes the metal-poor stars to migrate to larger radii and encourages the available gas to sink to the centre of the dwarf. Most of the gas is subsequently blown out of the halo through star formation feedback, but the remaining gas is consumed in the formation of a metal-rich population. In the exclusive case of satellites that have retained some of their gas at infall, it is the compression of this gas by ram pressure near pericentre that triggers the formation of metal-rich stars, whilst simultaneously preventing star formation at larger radii through stripping. Additionally, in a small number of field and satellite dwarfs, interactions with gaseous filaments and other galaxies can result in the formation of a metal-rich population. Regardless of the formation mechanism, a history of mergers typically enhances the spatial segregation.},

(2007, Science, 316, 1166) that 3 rotating TDGs do show significant evidence for being dark matter dominated is inconsistent with the current concordance cosmological theory unless yet another dark matter component is postulated. We confirm that the TDG rotation curves are consistent with Newtonian dynamics only if either an additional dark matter component is postulated, or if all 3 TDGs happen to be viewed nearly edge-on, which is unlikely given the geometry of the tidal debris. We also find that the observed rotation curves are very naturally explained without any free parameters within the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) framework if inclinations are adopted as derived by Bournaud et al. We explore different inclination angles and two different assumptions about the external field effect. The results do not change significantly, and we conclude therefore that Newtonian dynamics has severe problems while MOND does exceedingly well in explaining the observed rotation curves of the 3 TDGs studied by Bournaud et al.},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are characterized by properties which range from low surface brightness to the high surface brightness blue compact objects. The stochastic self-propagating star formation (SSPSF) model predicts that small systems can undergo a fluctuation which will completely stop propagation of star formation; the small galaxies will be restricted to star formation in a bursting mode of short-lived episodes during SSPSF. The bursting mode produces a star formation rate which varies with time leading to the diverse properties of dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamical evolution of idealized stellar systems by averaging results from many N-body simulations, each having modest numbers of stars. For isolated systems with stars of uniform mass, we discuss aspects of evolution up to the point of core collapse: relaxation and its N-dependence, the evolution of the density profile, the development of the velocity dispersion and anisotropy, and the rate of stellar escape.We find that the continuum models (gas and Fokker--Planck) agree quite accurately with N-body simulations in which N is of order of a few hundred. Small deviations from these models are present at small radii and at radii from the half-mass radius outwards. They are probably associated with binary activity and with the development of anisotropy, respectively. As expected, the N-body systems are strongly anisotropic in the outer half of the mass, while in the core the velocity distribution is isotropic to good approximation. Anisotropy has a very important influence on the rate of escape of stars.We also estimate quite reliable values for the coefficient \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ in the Coulomb logarithm ln\$({\textbackslash}gamma N)\$ and the conductivity coefficient C in the gas model of Lynden-Bell \&amp; Eggleton. These are \${\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}simeq 0.11\$ and \$C {\textbackslash}simeq 0.104\$, respectively.},

  abstract = {The giant southern stream (GSS) is the most prominent tidal debris feature in M31's stellar halo and covers a significant fraction of its southern quadrant. The GSS is a complex structure composed of a relatively metal-rich, high-surface-brightness "core" and a lower metallicity, lower-surface-brightness "envelope." We present spectroscopy of red giant stars in six fields in the vicinity of M31's GSS (including four new fields and improved spectroscopic reductions for two previously published fields) and one field on stream C, an arc-like feature seen in star-count maps on M31's southeast minor axis at R {\textasciitilde} 60 kpc. These data are part of our ongoing Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo survey of M31 using the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II 10 m telescope. Several GSS-related findings and measurements are presented here. We present the innermost kinematical detection of the GSS core to date (R = 17 kpc). This field also contains the inner continuation of a second kinematically cold component that was originally seen in a GSS core field at R {\textasciitilde} 21 kpc. The velocity gradients of the GSS and the second component in the combined data set are parallel over a range of {$\Delta$}R = 7 kpc, suggesting that this may represent a bifurcation in the line-of-sight velocities of GSS stars. We present the first kinematical detection of substructure in the GSS envelope (S quadrant, R {\textasciitilde} 58 kpc). Using kinematically identified samples, we show that the envelope debris has a {\textasciitilde}0.7 dex lower mean photometric metallicity and possibly higher intrinsic velocity dispersion than the GSS core. The GSS is also identified in the field of the M31 dwarf spheroidal satellite And I; the GSS in this field has a metallicity distribution identical to that of the GSS core. We confirm the previous finding of two kinematically cold components in stream C, and measure intrinsic velocity dispersions of {\textasciitilde}10 and {\textasciitilde}4 km s-1. This compilation of the kinematical (mean velocity, intrinsic velocity dispersion) and chemical properties of stars in the GSS core and envelope, coupled with published surface-brightness measurements and wide-area star-count maps, will improve constraints on the orbit and internal structure of the dwarf satellite progenitor.},

To this aim, the following steps are followed: (1) first, we re-write the formalism for converting synthetic stellar spectra into tables of bolometric corrections. The resulting formulas can be applied to any photometric system, provided that the zero-points are specified by means of either ABmag, STmag, VEGAmag, or a standard star system that includes well-known spectrophotometric standards. Interstellar absorption can be considered in a self-consistent way. (2) We assemble an extended and updated library of stellar intrinsic spectra. It is mostly based on ``non-overshooting'' ATLAS9 models, suitably extended to both low and high effective temperatures. This offers an excellent coverage of the parameter space of T\_eff, log g, and [M/H]. We briefly discuss the main uncertainties and points still deserving more improvement. (3) From the spectral library, we derive tables of bolometric corrections for Johnson-Cousins-Glass, HST/WFPC2, HST/NICMOS, Washington, and ESO Imaging Survey systems (this latter consisting on the WFI, EMMI, and SOFI filter sets). (4) These tables are used to convert several sets of Padova isochrones into the corresponding absolute magnitudes and colours, thus providing a useful database for several astrophysical applications.

  abstract = {Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are commonly found in close proximity to the Milky Way and other massive spiral galaxies. As such, their projected stellar ellipticity and extended light distributions are often thought to owe to tidal forces. In this paper, we study the projected stellar ellipticities and faint stellar outskirts of tidally isolated ultra-faints drawn from the 'Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy Formation's Edge' (EDGE) cosmological simulation suite. Despite their tidal isolation, our simulated dwarfs exhibit a wide range of projected ellipticities (0.03 \&lt; {$\varepsilon$} \&lt; 0.85), with many possessing anisotropic extended stellar haloes that mimic tidal tails, but owe instead to late-time accretion of lower mass companions. Furthermore, we find a strong causal relationship between ellipticity and formation time of a UFD, which is robust to a wide variation in the feedback model. We show that the distribution of projected ellipticities in our suite of simulated EDGE dwarfs matches well with a sample of 19 Local Group dwarf galaxies and a sample of 11 isolated dwarf galaxies. Given ellipticity in EDGE arises from an ex-situ accretion origin, the agreement in shape indicates the ellipticities of some observed dwarfs may also originate from a non-tidal scenario. The orbital parameters of these observed dwarfs further support that they are not currently tidally disrupting. If the baryonic content in these galaxies is still tidally intact, then the same may be true for their dark matter content, making these galaxies in our Local Group pristine laboratories for testing dark matter and galaxy formation models.},

  abstract = {Dwarf satellite galaxies undergo strong tidal forces produced by the main galaxy potential. These forces disturb the satellite and produce asymmetries in its stellar distribution, tidal tail formation, and modifications of the velocity dispersion profiles. Most of these features are observed in the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which is one of the closest satellites of the Milky Way. These features show that UMi is being tidally disrupted and is probably not in virial equilibrium. The high-velocity dispersion of UMi would also be a reflection of this tidal disruption and is not the signature of the large dark matter content that would be deduced if virial equilibrium is assumed. In order to avoid the uncertainty produced when virial equilibrium is assumed in systems in strong tidal fields, we present a new method of calculating the mass-to-luminosity ratio of disrupted dwarf galaxies. This method is based on numerical simulations and only takes into account the shape of the dwarf density profile and the tidal tail brightness, but it does not depend on the kinematics of the dwarf. Applying this method to UMi, we obtain a mass-to-luminosity relation of 12, which is lower than the value obtained assuming virial equilibrium (M/L=60). In addition, if UMi has a large dark matter content, it will be impossible to reproduce a tidal tail as luminous as the one observed.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent studies suggesting that the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) could be significantly more massive than previously thought, we explore whether the approximation of an inertial Galactocentric reference frame is still valid in the presence of such a massive LMC. We find that previous estimates of the LMC's orbital period and apocentric distance derived assuming a fixed Milky Way (MW) are significantly shortened for models where the MW is allowed to move freely in response to the gravitational pull of the LMC. Holding other parameters fixed, the fraction of models favoring first infall is reduced. Due to this interaction, the MW center of mass within the inner 50 kpc can be significantly displaced in phase-space in a very short period of time that ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 Gyr by as much as 30 kpc and 75 km s-1. Furthermore, we show that the gravitational pull of the LMC and response of the MW are likely to significantly affect the orbit and phase space distribution of tidal debris from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). Such effects are larger than previous estimates based on the torque of the LMC alone. As a result, Sgr deposits debris in regions of the sky that are not aligned with the present-day Sgr orbital plane. In addition, we find that properly accounting for the movement of the MW around its common center of mass with the LMC significantly modifies the angular distance between apocenters and tilts its orbital pole, alleviating tensions between previous models and observations. While these models are preliminary in nature, they highlight the central importance of accounting for the mutual gravitational interaction between the MW and LMC when modeling the kinematics of objects in the MW and Local Group.},

  abstract = {As part of a research program exploring how and why dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies depart from the fundamental plane defined by luminous elliptical (E) galaxies, we have analyzed archival Hubble Space Telescope F606W images of a sample of 18 dE galaxy candidates in the Coma Cluster. We model the full radial extent of their light profiles by simultaneously fitting a point-spread function (PSF) convolved S{\'e}rsic R1/n model and, when necessary, either a central point source or a central PSF-convolved Gaussian. Nucleation was detected in all but two of our final sample of 15 dE galaxies. When detected, the luminosities of the central component, Lnuc, scale with the host galaxy luminosity Lgal such that Lnuc=104.76+/-0.10(Lgal/107)0.87+/-0.26. We confirm that the light profiles of the underlying host galaxies display systematic departures from an exponential model that are correlated with the model-independent host galaxy luminosity and are not due to biasing from the nuclear component. The Pearson correlation coefficient between logn and central galaxy surface brightness {$\mu$}0 (excluding the flux from extraneous central components) is -0.83 at a significance level of 99.99\%. Excluding one outlier, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the logarithm of the S{\'e}rsic index n and the host galaxy magnitude is -0.77 at a significance of 99.9\%. We explain the observed relationship between dE galaxy luminosity and the inner logarithmic profile slope {$\gamma$}' as a by-product of the correlation between luminosity and S{\'e}rsic index n. Including, from the literature, an additional 232 dE and E galaxies spanning 10 mag in absolute magnitude M, the dE galaxies are shown to display a continuous sequence with the brighter E galaxies, such that {$\mu$}0 brightens linearly with M until core formation causes the most luminous (MB{$<$}{\textasciitilde}-20.5) E galaxies to deviate from this relation. The different behavior of dE and E galaxies in the M-{$<\mu>$}e (and M-{$\mu$}e) diagram and the {$<\mu>$}e-logRe diagram has nothing to do with core formation and is in fact expected from the continuous and linear relation between M and {$\mu$}0, and M and logn.

Auriga adopts the Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony and includes a comprehensive galaxy formation physics model following the coupled cosmic evolution of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes which has been shown to produce numerically well-converged galaxy properties for Milky Way-mass systems. We describe the first public data release of this augmented suite of Auriga simulations, which includes raw snapshots, group catalogues, merger trees, initial conditions, and supplementary data, as well as public analysis tools with worked examples of how to use the data. To demonstrate the value and robustness of the simulation predictions, we analyse a series of low-redshift global properties that compare well with many observed scaling relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the star-forming (SF) main sequence, and H I gas fraction/disc thickness. Finally, we show that SF gas discs appear to build rotation and velocity dispersion rapidly for \$zrsim 3\$ before they 'settle' into ever-increasing rotation-dispersion ratios (\$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$). This evolution appears to be in rough agreement with some kinematic measurements from H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ observations, and demonstrates an application of how to utilize the released data.},

  abstract = {Ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies are dominated by dark matter, the distribution of which may be inferred from the kinematics of that galaxy's stellar population. Star-by-star observations are available for the satellite UFD galaxies of the Milky Way, making them uniquely good laboratories in which to test cosmological predictions at the smallest scales. However, the kinematics of these galaxies are complicated by the presence of binary stars, which alter the stellar velocity distribution. In particular these binary stars increase the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion, which is related to the total galactic mass by the virial theorem. Without correctly eliminating or accounting for binary stars we may therefore overestimate the masses of UFD galaxies or even confuse globular clusters for UFD galaxies. Here we write down the probability density function for the observed line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of a stellar population containing both visual and spectroscopic binary stars, which we then use to determine the effect of those binary stars on the observed LOS velocity dispersion. For the coldest UFD galaxies the fractional increase in LOS velocity dispersion is of order one and for the coldest globular clusters is of order 100. However, if the stellar initial mass function is bottom light, as it may be for UFD galaxies and globular clusters, then both of these values increase by half a dex.},

  abstract = {The highly elliptical, 16-year-period orbit of the star S2 around the massive black hole candidate Sgr A* is a sensitive probe of the gravitational field in the Galactic centre. Near pericentre at 120 AU {$\approx$} 1400 Schwarzschild radii, the star has an orbital speed of {$\approx$}7650 km s-1, such that the first-order effects of Special and General Relativity have now become detectable with current capabilities. Over the past 26 years, we have monitored the radial velocity and motion on the sky of S2, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics instruments on the ESO Very Large Telescope, and since 2016 and leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018, with the four-telescope interferometric beam-combiner instrument GRAVITY. From data up to and including pericentre, we robustly detect the combined gravitational redshift and relativistic transverse Doppler effect for S2 of z = {$\Delta\lambda$} / {$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 200 km s-1/c with different statistical analysis methods. When parameterising the post-Newtonian contribution from these effects by a factor f , with f = 0 and f = 1 corresponding to the Newtonian and general relativistic limits, respectively, we find from posterior fitting with different weighting schemes f = 0.90 {\textpm} 0.09{\textbar}stat {\textpm} 0.15{\textbar}sys. The S2 data are inconsistent with pure Newtonian dynamics. This paper is dedicated to Tal Alexander, who passed away about a week before the pericentre approach of S2.},

All of the new dwarfs, with the exception of Leo T, have no detected H I. The majority of dwarf galaxies within {\textasciitilde}270 kpc of the Milky Way or Andromeda are undetected in H I ({$<$}104 M {$\odot$} for Milky Way dwarfs), while those further than {\textasciitilde}270 kpc are predominantly detected with masses {\textasciitilde}105 to 108 M {$\odot$}. Analytical ram-pressure arguments combined with velocities obtained via proper motion studies allow for an estimate of the halo density of the Milky Way at several distances. This halo density is constrained to be greater than 2{\texttimes} 10-4-3 {\texttimes} 10-4 cm-3 out to distances of at least 70 kpc. This is broadly consistent with theoretical models of the diffuse gas in a Milky Way-like halo and is consistent with this component hosting a large fraction of a galaxy's baryons. Accounting for completeness in the dwarf galaxy count, gasless dwarf galaxies could have provided at most 2.1 {\texttimes} 108 M {$\odot$} of H I gas to the Milky Way, which suggests that most of our Galaxy's star formation fuel does not come from accreted small satellites in the current era.},

  abstract = {The gas-deficient dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies present an evolutionary puzzle that we explore in 40 early-type and late-type dwarfs in the Local Group and nearby field. Although dSph's experienced star formation over extended time spans in their youths, today all but one are completely free of detectable interstellar material, even in the Fornax dSph, where stars formed in the last 100 Myr. Combining photometric and spectroscopic stellar metallicity estimates for red giant branches with high-sensitivity H I 21 cm line data from the literature, we show that the well-established offset in luminosity-metallicity relationships for dSph's and dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies exists also when confining the comparison to their old stellar populations: dSph's have higher mean stellar metallicities for a fixed optical luminosity. Evidently star formation in younger dSph's was more vigorous than in the youthful dIrr's, leading to more efficient enrichment. Dwarf galaxies, whose locus in the luminosity-metallicity diagram is consistent with that of dSph's, even when baryonic luminosities are considered, are the ``transition-type dwarfs'' Phoenix, DDO 210, LGS 3, Antlia, and KKR 25. These dwarfs have mixed dIrr/dSph morphologies, low stellar masses, low angular momentum, and H I contents of at most a few 106 Msolar. Unlike dIrr's many transition-type dwarfs would closely resemble dSph's if their gas were removed, as required to become a dSph; they are likely dSph progenitors. As gas removal is the key factor for such a transition, we consider the empirical evidence in favor and against various gas removal processes. We suggest that internal gas removal mechanisms are inadequate and favor ram-pressure stripping to clean the bulk of interstellar matter from galaxies to make dSph's. A combination of initial conditions and environment seems to support the formation of dSph's: nearby dSph's appear to form from small galaxies with active early star formation, whose evolution halts due to externally induced gas loss. Transition-type dwarfs, then, are dSph's that kept their interstellar medium and therefore should replace dSph's in isolated locations where stripping is ineffective.},

  abstract = {My Thesis on "Stellar Population Studies in Nearby Galaxies" covers the development of new tools for stellar population studies, study of young Magellanic Cloud (MC) clusters and their surroundings study of old and intermediate-age populations in two dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. The new tools for population studies include the removal of extinction considering its dependence on stellar temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity (e.g., Grebel \& Roberts 1995), and the determination of age, metallicity, reddening, and distance through simultaneous isochrone fitting to multi-colour photometry (Grebel et al. 1994a). The young SMC cluster NGC 330 is considered a cornerstone for understanding stellar evolution in metal-poor environments. I investigate why previous [Fe/H] determinations for this cluster differ by more than 1 dex and show that they can be largely reconciled when using the same reddening. Different star formation mechanisms seem to have been at work for clusters of similar age. Large-scale star formation processes in the field appear to have triggered the collapse of the molecular clouds that formed NGC 330 and NGC 2004 in the LMC, while the surrounding field of NGC 1818 in the LMC is older than the cluster itself (Grebel 1996). Previous studies found several bright blue stars in young MC clusters to be giants spectroscopically and to lie in the blue Hertzsprung gap suggesting that stellar evolutionary theories may need to be revised and that large age spreads exist in these clusters. We argue (Grebel et al. 1996) that these stars probably are core H burning main-sequence stars that appear as blue stragglers resulting from binary evolution and/or rapid rotation. Many are Be stars and likely rapid rotators. Blue stragglers are also present in NGC 1818, NGC 2004, and NGC 2100 and possibly in all young clusters in the MCs. This suggests that (1) previously inferred large spreads in star formation times are much smaller, (2) ages of young MC clusters may have been systematically underestimated by mistaking blue stragglers for the main-sequence turnoff, and (3) the upper slopes of the IMFs may need to be re-evaluated (Grebel et al. 1996). With an efficient photometric survey method for emission-line stars (Grebel et al. 1992, 1994b, Grebel 1996) we investigated the Be star content of young MC clusters. In NGC 330 also variable Be stars and binaries were identified. NGC 330 and the slightly older NGC 1818 are very rich in Be stars (Grebel 1996), while NGC 2004 has a lower Be star content despite similar metallicity and age. H-alpha luminosity and infrared excess are well correlated though they do not seem to depend on spectral class, while H-alpha luminosity and ultraviolet excess are only weakly correlated. For the Sculptor and Fornax dSph galaxies we established the existence of subpopulations distinct in metallicity and in age (Grebel et al. 1994a). In Sculptor old and metal-poor populations dominate. In Fornax, we find a mixture of intermediate-age field populations and an age gradient with galactocentric radius. The lack of a distinguishable old field population, the metallicity spread in Fornax's globular clusters, and their larger age indicate that they may not have formed in Fornax itself. On the other hand, the suggested 1 Gyr-old subgiants may instead represent a sparsely populated horizontal branch of the missing old field population. Fornax's intermediate-age field population formed over a period of about 10 Gyr and shows considerable enrichment, while Sculptor's populations are comparatively well-confined in ages and abundances. The impact on evolutionary scenarios of the Local Group is discussed. This work was supported by a Student Fellowship of the European Southern Observatory, by the Collaborative Visitors Program of the Space Telescope Science Institute, and by a Graduate Fellowship of the German Research Foundation (DFG-Graduiertenkolleg "Magellanic Clouds").

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the abundance and structural evolution of dark matter subhaloes is crucial for understanding galaxy formation, modelling galaxy clustering, and constraining the nature of dark matter. Due to the non-linear nature of subhalo evolution, cosmological N-body simulations remain its primary method of investigation. However, it has recently been demonstrated that such simulations are still heavily impacted by artificial disruption, diminishing the information content on small scales, and reducing the reliability of all simulation-calibrated semi-analytical models. In this paper, we utilize the recently released DASH library of high-resolution, idealized simulations of the tidal evolution of subhaloes, which are unhindered by numerical overmerging due to discreteness noise or force softening, to calibrate an improved, more accurate model of the evolution of the density profiles of subhaloes that undergo tidal heating and stripping within their host halo. By testing previous findings that the structural evolution of a tidally truncated subhalo depends solely on the fraction of mass stripped, independent of the details of the stripping, we identify an additional dependence on the initial subhalo concentration. We provide significantly improved fitting functions for the subhalo density profiles and structural parameters (Vmax and rmax) that are unimpeded by numerical systematics and applicable to a wide range of parameter space. This model will be an integral component of a future semi-analytical treatment of substructure evolution, which can be used to predict key quantities, such as the evolved subhalo mass function and annihilation boost factors, and validate such calculations performed with cosmological simulations.},

Three of the streams, ranging between 3 and 15 kpc in distance and spanning between 37{$^\circ$} and 84{$^\circ$} on the sky, are very narrow and are most probably tidal streams originating in extant or disrupted globular clusters. The fourth stream is much broader, roughly 45 kpc distant, at least 53{$^\circ$} in length, and is most likely the tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy. As each of the streams spans multiple constellations, we extend tradition and designate them the Acheron, Cocytos, Lethe, and Styx streams. At the same distance and apparently embedded in the Styx stream is a {\textasciitilde}1 kpc wide concentration of stars with an apparently similar color-magnitude distribution, which we designate Bootes III. Given its very low surface density, its location within the stream, and its apparently disturbed morphology, we argue that Bootes III may be the progenitor of Styx and in possibly the final throes of tidal dissolution. While the current data do not permit strong constraints, preliminary orbit estimates for the streams do not point to any likely progenitors among the known globular clusters and dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract = {We introduce the LYRA project, a new high-resolution galaxy formation model built within the framework of the cosmological hydrodynamical moving mesh code AREPO. The model resolves the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) down to 10 K. It forms individual stars sampled from the initial mass function (IMF), and tracks their lifetimes and death pathways individually. Single supernova (SN) blast waves with variable energy are followed within the hydrodynamic calculation to interact with the surrounding ISM. In this paper, we present the methods and apply the model to a \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ isolated halo. We demonstrate that the majority of SNe are Sedov resolved at our fiducial gas mass resolution of \$4{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ . We show that our SN feedback prescription self-consistently produces a hot phase within the ISM that drives significant outflows, reduces the gas density, and suppresses star formation. Clustered SNe play a major role in enhancing the effectiveness of feedback, because the majority of explosions occur in low-density material. Accounting for variable SN energy allows the feedback to respond directly to stellar evolution. We show that the ISM is sensitive to the spatially distributed energy deposition. It strongly affects the outflow behaviour, reducing the mass loading by a factor of 2-3, thus allowing the galaxy to retain a higher fraction of mass and metals. LYRA makes it possible to use a comprehensive multiphysics ISM model directly in cosmological (zoom) simulations of dwarf and higher mass galaxies.},

UNIONS is addressing some of the most fundamental questions in astronomy, including the properties of dark matter, the growth of structure in the Universe from the very smallest galaxies to large-scale structure, and the assembly of the Milky Way. It is set to become the major ground-based legacy survey for the northern hemisphere for the next decade and provides an essential northern complement to the static-sky science of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time. UNIONS supports the core science mission of the \{{\textbackslash}it Euclid\} space mission by providing the data necessary in the northern hemisphere for the calibration of the wavelength dependence of the \{{\textbackslash}it Euclid\} point-spread function and derivation of photometric redshifts in the North Galactic Cap. This region contains the highest quality sky for \{{\textbackslash}it Euclid\}, with low backgrounds from the zodiacal light, stellar density, extinction, and emission from Galactic cirrus. Here, we describe the UNIONS survey components, science goals, data products, and the current status of the overall program.},

  abstract = {Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star, and globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of globular clusters depends on their orbital pericentre and total energy, and that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with numerous orbits. This calibration starts from the bulge to Kraken, Gaia Sausage Enceladus, Sagittarius stellar systems, and finally to the new coming dwarfs, either or not linked to the vast-polar structure. The most eccentric globular clusters, and dwarfs have their half-light radius scaling as the inverse of their binding energy, and this over more than two decades. This means that earlier arriving satellites are smaller due to the tidal effects of the MW. Therefore, most halo inhabitants appear to have their structural parameters shaped by MW tides, and also by ram-pressure for the most recent arrivals, the dwarf galaxies. The correlations found in this study can be used as tools to further investigate the origin of globular clusters and dwarfs, as well as the assembly history of our Galaxy.},

  abstract = {We study how structural properties of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies are linked to their orbits in the Milky Way halo. From the inner to the outer halo, orbital energy increases and stellar-systems gradually move out of internal equilibrium: in the inner halo, high-surface brightness globular clusters are at pseudo-equilibrium, while further away, low-surface brightness clusters and dwarfs appear more tidally disturbed. Dwarf galaxies are the latest to arrive into the halo as indicated by their large orbital energies and pericentres, and have no time for more than one orbit. Their (gas-rich) progenitors likely lost their gas during their recent arrival in the Galactic halo. If dwarfs are at equilibrium with their dark matter (DM) content, the DM density should anticorrelate with pericentre. However, the transformation of DM dominated dwarfs from gas-rich rotation-supported into gas-poor dispersion-supported systems is unlikely accomplished during a single orbit. We suggest instead that the above anticorrelation is brought by the combination of ram-pressure stripping and of Galactic tidal shocks. Recent gas removal leads to an expansion of their stellar content caused by the associated gravity loss, making them sufficiently fragile to be transformed near pericentre passage. Out of equilibrium dwarfs would explain the observed anticorrelation of kinematics-based DM density with pericentre without invoking DM density itself, questioning its previous estimates. Ram-pressure stripping and tidal shocks may contribute to the dwarf velocity dispersion excess. It predicts the presence of numerous stars in their outskirts and a few young stars in their cores.},

  abstract = {The growing number of Milky Way satellites detected in recent years has introduced a new focus for stellar abundance analysis. Abundances of stars in satellites have been used to probe the nature of these systems and their chemical evolution. However, for most satellites, only centrally located stars have been examined. This paper presents an analysis of three stars in the Tucana V system, one in the inner region and two at {$\sim$}10- (7--10 half-light radii) from the center. We find a remarkable chemical diversity between the stars. One star exhibits enhancements in rapid neutron-capture elements (an r-I star), and another is highly enhanced in C, N, and O but with low neutron-capture abundances (a CEMP-no star). The metallicities of the stars analyzed span more than 1 dex from [Fe/H] = -3.55 to -2.46. This, combined with a large abundance range of other elements like Ca, Sc, and Ni, confirms that Tuc V is an ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy. The variation in abundances, highlighted by [Mg/Ca] ratios ranging from +0.89 to -0.75, among the stars demonstrates that the chemical enrichment history of Tuc V was very inhomogeneous. Tuc V is only the second UFD galaxy in which stars located at large distances from the galactic center have been analyzed, along with Tucana II. The chemical diversity seen in these two galaxies, driven by the composition of the noncentral member stars, suggests that distant member stars are important to include when classifying faint satellites and that these systems may have experienced more complex chemical enrichment histories than previously anticipated.},

It is shown that if the density fluctuations at this epoch are proportional to N-n (where N is the number of particles in a disturbance), then n must exactly, or very closely, equal the value 23 in order that such fluctuations develop into protogalaxies. This result is independent of the value of the threshold epoch, and of the equation of state for the very early universe. Arguments of a speculative nature are then presented which indicate that the threshold epoch occurs at the Planck density. It is also proposed that the initial conditions of galaxy formation are metric fluctuations at the threshold epoch of classical cosmology. The evidence in favor of this theory is (i) the density fluctuation obeys the n=23 rule, and (ii) the spin fluctuation gives an eventual angular momentum of the order N43ℏ, in reasonable agrement with that of the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {We investigate the orbital evolution of satellite galaxies using numerical simulations. It has long been believed that orbits suffer circularization due to dynamical friction from the galactic halo during orbital decay. This circularization was confirmed by numerous simulations in which dynamical friction was added as an external force. However, some of the recent N-body simulations have demonstrated that circularization is much slower than expected from approximate calculations. We find that the dominant reason for this discrepancy is the assumption that the Coulomb logarithm log{$\Lambda$} is constant, which has been used in practically all recent calculations. Since the size of the satellite is relatively large, an accurate determination of the outer cutoff radius is crucial to obtaining a good estimate for the dynamical friction. An excellent agreement between N-body simulations and approximate calculations is observed when the outer cutoff radius is taken to be the distance of the satellite to the center of the galaxy. When the satellite is at the perigalacticon, the distance to the center is smaller, and therefore log{$\Lambda$} becomes smaller. As a result, the dynamical friction becomes less effective. We apply our result to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that the expected lifetime of the LMC is twice as long as that which would be predicted with previous calculations. Previous studies predict that the LMC will merge into the Milky Way after 7 Gyr, while we find that the merging will take place 14 Gyr from now. Our result suggests that generally, satellites formed around a galaxy have longer lifetimes than previous estimates.},

We present and analyze the APOGEE chemical abundance patterns of each galaxy to draw robust conclusions about their star formation histories, by quantifying the relative abundance trends of multiple elements (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, Ni, and Ce), as well as by fitting chemical evolution models to the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance plane for each galaxy. Results show that the chemical signatures of the starburst in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) observed by Nidever et al. in the {$\alpha$}-element abundances extend to C+N, Al, and Ni, with the major burst in the SMC occurring some 3-4 Gyr before the burst in the LMC. We find that Sgr and Fnx also exhibit chemical abundance patterns suggestive of secondary star formation epochs, but these events were weaker and earlier ({\textasciitilde}5-7 Gyr ago) than those observed in the MCs. There is no chemical evidence of a second starburst in GSE, but this galaxy shows the strongest initial star formation as compared to the other four galaxies. All dwarf galaxies had greater relative contributions of AGB stars to their enrichment than the MW. Comparing and contrasting these chemical patterns highlight the importance of galaxy environment on its chemical evolution.},

  abstract = {We investigate the evolution of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) halos using N-body simulations of tidal stripping of substructure halos within a static host potential. We find that halos modeled following the Navarro, Frenk, \& White (NFW) mass profile lose mass continuously because of tides from the massive host, leading to the total disruption of satellite halos with small tidal radii. Although mass is predominantly stripped from the outer regions, tidal heating also causes the halo to expand and the central density to decrease after each pericentric passage, when mass loss preferentially occurs. As a result, simple models based on the tidal-limit approximation underestimate significantly the tidal mass loss over several orbits. The equilibrium structure of stripped NFW halos depends mainly on the fraction of mass lost and can be expressed in terms of a simple correction to the original NFW profile. We apply these results to substructure in the Milky Way and conclude that the dark matter halos surrounding its dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites have circular velocity curves that peak well beyond the luminous radius at velocities significantly higher than expected from the stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Our modeling suggests that the true tidal radii of dSphs lie well beyond the putative tidal cutoff observed in the surface brightness profile, suggesting that the latter are not really tidal in origin but rather features in the light profile of limited dynamical relevance. For Draco in particular, our modeling implies that its tidal radius is much larger than derived by Irwin \& Hatzidimitriou, lending support to the interpretation of recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey data by Odenkirchen et al. Similarly, our model suggests that Carina's halo has a peak circular velocity of order {\textasciitilde}55 km s-1, which may help explain how this small galaxy has managed to retain enough gas to undergo several bursts of star formation. Our results imply a close correspondence between the most massive substructure halos expected in a CDM universe and the known satellites of the Milky Way and suggest that only substructure halos with peak circular velocities below 35 km s-1 lack readily detectable luminous counterparts.},

  abstract = {Elucidating dark matter density profiles in Galactic dwarf satellites is essential to understanding not only the quintessence of dark matter, but also the evolution of the satellites themselves. In this work, we present the current constraints on dark matter densities in Galactic ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) and diffuse galaxies. Applying our constructed nonspherical mass models to the currently available kinematic data of the 25 UFDs and two diffuse satellites, we find that whereas most of the galaxies have huge uncertainties on the inferred dark matter density profiles, Eridanus II, Segue I, and Willman 1 favor cuspy central profiles even when considering effects of a prior bias. We compare our results with the simulated subhalos on the plane between the dark matter density at 150 pc and the pericenter distance. We find that the most observed satellites and the simulated subhalos are similarly distributed on this plane, except for Antlia 2, Crater 2, and Tucana 3, which are less than one-tenth of the density. Despite considerable tidal effects, the subhalos detected by commonly used subhalo finders have difficulty explaining such a huge deviation. We also estimate the dynamical mass-to-light ratios of the satellites and confirm the ratio is linked to stellar mass and metallicity. Tucana 3 deviates largely from these relations, while it follows the mass-metallicity relation. This indicates that Tucana 3 has a cored dark matter halo, despite a significant uncertainty in its ratios.},

  abstract = {Radial surface brightness profiles of spiral galaxies are classified into three types: (I) single exponential, or the light falls off with one exponential to a break before falling off (II) more steeply, or (III) less steeply. Profile breaks are also found in dwarf disks, but some dwarf Type IIs are flat or increasing out to a break before falling off. Here we re-examine the stellar disk profiles of 141 dwarfs: 96 dwarf irregulars (dIms), 26 Blue Compact Dwarfs (BCDs), and 19 Magellanic-type spirals (Sms). We fit single, double, or even triple exponential profiles in up to 11 passbands: GALEX FUV and NUV, ground-based UBVJHK and H{$\alpha$}, and Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m. We find that more luminous galaxies have brighter centers, larger inner and outer scale lengths, and breaks at larger radii; dwarf trends with MB extend to spirals. However, the V-band break surface brightness is independent of break type, MB, and Hubble type. Dwarf Type II and III profiles fall off similarly beyond the breaks but have different interiors and IIs break {$\sim$}twice as far as IIIs. Outer Type II and III scale lengths may have weak trends with wavelength, but pure Type II inner scale lengths clearly decrease from the FUV to visible bands whereas Type III inner scale lengths increase with redder bands. This suggests the influence of different star formation histories on profile type, but nonetheless the break location is approximately the same in all passbands. Dwarfs continue trends between profile and Hubble types such that later-type galaxies have more Type II but fewer Type I and III profiles than early-type spirals. BCDs and Sms are over-represented as Types III and II, respectively, compared to dIms.},

Like spirals, dwarf galaxies have three types of radial surface brightness profiles: (I) single exponential throughout the observed extent (the minority), (II) down-bending (the majority), and (III) up-bending. We find that the colors of (1) Type I dwarfs generally become redder with increasing radius, unlike spirals which have a blueing trend that flattens beyond {$\sim$}1.5 disk scale lengths, (2) Type II dwarfs come in six different ``flavors,'' one of which mimics the ``U'' shape of spirals, and (3) Type III dwarfs have a stretched ``S'' shape where the central colors are flattish, become steeply redder toward the surface brightness break, then remain roughly constant beyond, which is similar to spiral Type III color profiles, but without the central outward bluing. Faint (-9 {$>$} MB {$>$} -14) Type II dwarfs tend to have continuously red or ``U'' shaped colors and steeper color slopes than bright (-14 {$>$} MB {$>$} -19) Type II dwarfs, which additionally have colors that become bluer or remain constant with increasing radius. Sm dwarfs and BCDs tend to have at least some blue and red radial color trend, respectively. Additionally, we determine stellar surface mass density ({$\Sigma$}) profiles and use them to show that the break in {$\Sigma$} generally remains in Type II dwarfs (unlike Type II spirals) but generally disappears in Type III dwarfs (unlike Type III spirals). Moreover, the break in {$\Sigma$} is strong, intermediate, and weak in faint dwarfs, bright dwarfs, and spirals, respectively, indicating that {$\Sigma$} may straighten with increasing galaxy mass. Finally, the average stellar surface mass density at the surface brightness break is roughly 1-2 M{$\odot$} pc-2 for Type II dwarfs but higher at 5.9 M{$\odot$} pc-2 or 27 M{$\odot$} pc-2 for Type III BCDs and dIms, respectively.},

  abstract = {This thesis attempts to untangle, as best as possible, the importance of internally-driven evolutionary mechanisms relative to externally-driven effects, in shaping the structure and properties of the smallest observable galaxies. All galaxies are influenced by internal processes, such as feedback from star formation and the infall of gas or lack thereof, as well as environmental processes, like tides and ram pressure stripping. The smallest galaxies - dwarfs - are highly susceptible to all such processes, and their resulting structure is the summation of all prior events. I use nearby dwarf galaxies of the Local Group as test cases, focusing on those which are separated from the massive galaxies (like the Milky Way) and can be considered as "isolated''. These dwarfs are observed as part of the Solitary Local (Solo) Dwarf Galaxy Survey. Solo dwarfs will have spent the majority of their time as isolated systems, hence their properties should generally reflect their "intrinsic nature", unperturbed and unaffected by interactions with other systems. This survey was designed to focus on the old stellar populations present in these galaxies, in order to characterize their faint and extended structures. These old stellar populations should carry the hallmarks of the dwarfs' histories. By comparing the observed properties of Solo dwarfs with dwarfs currently in close proximity to a large host galaxy (i.e., the M 31 and Milky Way satellites), it should be possible to determine what aspects of the properties of dwarfs are most affected by environmentally-driven processes. The Local Group is the ideal regime in which to study these faint features, as the dwarfs' close proximity to us presents an opportunity to fully characterize these galaxies. However, the number of dwarfs in the Local Group is limited, with several galaxies (e.g. IC 10 or Sag dSph) being the unique example of their "type" locally observable. This limited sample emphasizes the need for careful, homogeneous observations and analysis, such that comparisons between this small, yet highly diverse, snapshot of galaxies accurately reflects the true nature of these dwarfs. I have homogeneously analyzed the 12 closest Solo dwarfs observable from the northern hemisphere, resulting in a consistently derived dataset. I determine fundamental properties, like distances, and characterize the structure of the dwarfs. I explore the possibility that the dwarfs may be more consistent with a two component profile, rather than one, finding that they are largely well characterized by a single S{\'e}rsic profile. I then compare these isolated dwarfs with the well-studied satellites of the Milky Way and M 31, primarily using two other homogeneous surveys; the MegaCam Survey of Outer Halo Objects and the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey respectively. Examining each property (e.g. ellipticity, central surface brightness, or S{\'e}rsic radius) individually, we find no statistically significant differences between each group. However, when considering parameters in combination (e.g. absolute magnitude as a function of S{\'e}rsic radius), we see increased scatter in the satellite population, indicative of the impact of a massive host galaxy on the dwarfs, likely via tidal effects. The comparison between satellites and isolated dwarfs hones in on the impact of a massive galaxy in close proximity. Of course, processes within and surrounding the dwarf itself can also alter the dwarf. I look at the star formation histories and gas content of the dwarfs to explore the connection between internal and external processes in these small galaxies. Finally, I search for substructure in the form of satellites of dwarf galaxies, globular clusters and extended tidal features, all which inform about the dwarf's isolation, environment and history. Collectively, I generate comprehensive and detailed inspections of Local Group dwarfs and aim to understand them as products of their environment.},

  abstract = {We present detailed chemical abundances for 99 red-giant branch stars in the centre of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which have been obtained from high-resolution VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy. The abundances of Li, Na, {$\alpha$}-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca Ti), iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), and r- and s-process elements (Ba, La, Nd, Eu) were all derived using stellar atmosphere models and semi-automated analysis techniques. The iron abundances populate the whole metallicity distribution of the galaxy with the exception of the very low metallicity tail, -2.3 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -0.9. There is a marked decrease in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] over our sample, from the Galactic halo plateau value at low [Fe/H] and then, after a "knee", a decrease to sub-solar [{$\alpha$}/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. This is consistent with products of core-collapse supernovae dominating at early times, followed by the onset of supernovae type Ia as early as {$\sim$}12 Gyr ago. The s-process products from low-mass AGB stars also participate in the chemical evolution of Sculptor on a timescale comparable to that of supernovae type Ia. However, the r-process is consistent with having no time delay relative to core-collapse supernovae, at least at the later stages of the chemical evolution in Sculptor. Using the simple and well-behaved chemical evolution of Sculptor, we further derive empirical constraints on the relative importance of massive stars and supernovae type Ia to the nucleosynthesis of individual iron-peak and {$\alpha$}-elements. The most important contribution of supernovae type Ia is to the iron-peak elements: Fe, Cr, and Mn. There is, however, also a modest but non-negligible contribution to both the heavier {$\alpha$}-elements: S, Ca and Ti, and some of the iron-peak elements: Sc and Co. We see only a very small or no contribution to O, Mg, Ni, and Zn from supernovae type Ia in Sculptor. The observed chemical abundances in Sculptor show no evidence of a significantly different initial mass function, compared to that of the Milky Way. With the exception of neutron-capture elements at low [Fe/H], the scatter around mean trends in Sculptor for [Fe/H] {$>$} -2.3 is extremely low, and compatible with observational errors. Combined with the small scatter in the age-elemental abundances relation, this calls for an efficient mixing of metals in the gas in the centre of Sculptor since {$\sim$}12 Gyr ago.

Our kinematical sample is among the largest for any M31 satellite and extends out to two effective radii (r eff = 5.3" = 1.1 kpc). We find a mean systemic velocity of -192.4 {\textpm} 0.5 km s-1 and an average velocity dispersion of {$\sigma$} v = 7.8 {\textpm} 1.1 km s-1. While the rotation velocity along the major axis of And II is nearly zero ({$<$}1 km s-1), the rotation along the minor axis is significant with a maximum rotational velocity of v max = 8.6 {\textpm} 1.8 km s-1. We find a kinematical major axis, with a maximum rotational velocity of v max = 10.9 {\textpm} 2.4 km s-1, misaligned by 67{$^\circ$} to the isophotal major axis. And II is thus the first dwarf galaxy with evidence for nearly prolate rotation with a v max/{$\sigma$} v = 1.1, although given its ellipticity of epsilon = 0.10, this object may be triaxial. We measured metallicities for a subsample of our data, finding a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.39 {\textpm} 0.03 dex and an internal metallicity dispersion of 0.72 {\textpm} 0.03 dex. We find a radial metallicity gradient with metal-rich stars more centrally concentrated, but do not observe a significant difference in the dynamics of the two metallicity populations. And II is the only known dwarf galaxy to show minor axis rotation, making it a unique system whose existence offers important clues on the processes responsible for the formation of dSphs.},

The results presented are the first spectroscopic MDFs for dwarf systems surrounding a host galaxy other than the Milky Way (MW). Our sample consists of individual metallicity measurements for 1243 red giant branch member stars spread across these six systems. We determine metallicities based on the strength of the Ca II triplet lines using the empirical calibration of Carrera et al., which is calibrated over the metallicity range -4 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$}+0.5. We find that these M31 satellites lie on the same luminosity-metallicity relationship as the MW dwarf satellites. We do not find a trend between the internal metallicity spread and galaxy luminosity, contrary to previous studies. The MDF widths of And II and And VII are similar to the MW dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of comparable luminosity; however, our four brightest M31 dwarf satellites are more luminous than any of the MW dSphs and have broader MDFs. The MDFs of our six M31 dwarf satellites are consistent with the leaky box model of chemical evolution, although our metallicity errors allow a wide range of evolution models. We find a significant radial gradient in metallicity in only two of our six systems, NGC 185 and Andromeda II, and flat radial metallicity gradients in the rest of our sample with no observed correlation between rotational support and radial metallicity gradients. Although the average properties and radial trends of the M31 dwarf galaxies agree with their MW counterparts at similar luminosity, the detailed MDFs are different, particularly at the metal-rich end.},

The structure and kinematics of all Galactic components -- disc, bar/bulge and halo -- are now mapped in great detail not only in the Solar neighbourhood, but across a large part of the Milky Way. The dramatic improvements in the coverage and precision of observations revealed various disequilibrium processes, such as perturbations in the Galactic disc and the deformations of the outer halo, which are partly attributed to the interaction with satellite galaxies. The knowledge of the gravitational potential at all scales has also advanced considerably, but we are still far from having a consistent view on the key properties of the Galaxy, such as the bar pattern speed or the mass profile and shape of the dark halo. The complexity and interplay of several dynamical processes makes the interpretation of observational data challenging, and it is fair to say that more theoretical effort is needed to fully reap the fruit of the Gaia revolution.},

  abstract = {Context. Obtaining reliable distance estimates to gas clouds within the Milky Way is challenging in the absence of certain tracers. The kinematic distance approach has been used as an alternative, and it is derived from the assumption of circular trajectories around the Galactic centre. Consequently, significant errors are expected in regions where gas flow deviates from purely circular motions. Aims. We aim to quantify the systematic errors that arise from the kinematic distance method in the presence of a Galactic potential that is non-axisymmetric. We investigated how these errors differ in certain regions of the Galaxy and how they relate to the underlying dynamics. Methods. We performed 2D isothermal hydrodynamical simulation of the gas disk with the moving-mesh code AREPO, adding the capability of using an external potential provided by the AGAMA library for galactic dynamics. We introduced a new analytic potential of the Milky Way, taking elements from existing models and adjusting parameters to match recent observational constraints. Results. In line with results of previous studies, we report significant errors in the kinematic distance estimate for gas close to the Sun along sight lines towards the Galactic centre and anti-centre and associated with the Galactic bar. Kinematic distance errors are low within the spiral arms, as gas resides close to local potential minima and the resulting line-of-sight velocity is similar to what is expected for an axisymmetric potential. Interarm regions exhibit large deviations at any given Galactic radius, and this is caused by the gas being sped up or slowed down as it travels into or out of spiral arms. In addition, we identify 'zones of avoidance' in the lv-diagram, where the kinematic distance method is particularly unreliable and should only be used with caution, and we find a power-law relation between the kinematic distance error and the deviation of the projected line-of-sight velocity from circular motion.},

Here we summarize the current state of our knowledge of the interstellar medium (ISM), including atomic, molecular and ionized gas, along with their dust properties and metals. We also discuss star formation feedback, gas accretion, and mergers with other dwarfs that connect the ISM to the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. We highlight one of the most persistent mysteries: the nature of pervasive gas that is yet undetected as either molecular or cold hydrogen, the ``dark gas''. Here are a few highlights: 1. Significant quantities of HI are in far-outer gas disks. 2. Cold HI in dIrrs would be molecular in the Milky Way, making the chemical properties of star-forming clouds significantly different. 3. Stellar feedback has a much larger impact in dIrrs than in spiral galaxies. 4. The escape fraction of ionizing photons is significant, making dIrrs a plausible source for reionization in the early Universe. 5. Observations suggest a significantly higher abundance of hydrogen (H\$\_2\$ or cold HI) associated with CO in star-forming regions than that traced by the CO alone.},

We also include JHK imaging of 42 of these galaxies. The sample spans a large range in galactic parameters. Ellipse fit axial ratios, inclinations, and position angles are derived, integrated photometry and azimuthally averaged surface photometry profiles are determined, and exponential fits give the central surface brightnesses, scale lengths, and isophotal and half-power radii. These data are used to address the shapes of Im galaxies, look for clues to past interactions in large-scale peculiarities, examine the nature and consequences of bars, study color gradients and large-scale color variations, and compare the exponential disk profiles of the young and old stellar components. For example, color gradients exhibit a great variety and not all passbands are correlated. Bars are associated with higher star formation rates. Many irregulars show a double-exponential radial light profile that is steeper in the outer parts, and these are reproduced by a new model of star formation that is discussed in a companion paper. Some galaxies, primarily BCDs, have double exponentials that are steeper (and bluer) in the inner parts, presumably from centralized star formation. Im-type galaxies have thicker, less prominent dust layers than spiral galaxies because of their lower average surface densities and midplane extinctions.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have revealed streams of gas and stars in the halo of the Milky Way that are the debris from interactions between our Galaxy and some of its dwarf companion galaxies; the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Magellanic clouds. Analysis of the material has shown that much of the halo is made up of cannibalized satellite galaxies, and that dark matter is distributed nearly spherically in the Milky Way. It remains unclear, however, whether cannibalized substructures are as common in the haloes of galaxies as predicted by galaxy-formation theory. Here we report the discovery of a giant stream of metal-rich stars within the halo of the nearest large galaxy, M31 (the Andromeda galaxy). The source of this stream could be the dwarf galaxies M32 and NGC205, which are close companions of M31 and which may have lost a substantial number of stars owing to tidal interactions. The results demonstrate that the epoch of galaxy building still continues, albeit at a modest rate, and that tidal streams may be a generic feature of galaxy haloes.},

Following convention, we propose to call it the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Its properties are similar to those of the eight other dwarf spheroidal companions to the Milky Way, and it is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest of them- the Fornax system. The Sagittarius dwarf is elongated towards the plane of the Milky Way, suggesting that it is undergoing some tidal disruption before being absorbed by the Milky Way.},

Global and central mass-to-light ratios were calculated for these galaxies. They range from {\textasciitilde}=10 for Fornax and Sculptor to more than 200 for Draco. It appears plausible that Draco, Ursa Minor, Carina and Sextans contain significant amounts of dark matter, at least under the standard assumptions for the dynamics of these galaxies. However, the errors associated with these estimates remain - often forbiddingly - large, dominated (in most cases) by the errors in the luminosity and velocity dispersion. The possibility of the presence of extra-tidal stars in at least some of the dSphs is also discussed, together with the effect of the Galactic tidal field on the dSphs' morphology. Both Sextans and Sculptor appear to be good candidates for systems in the process of tidal disruption.},

Other dynamical consequences are briefly discussed, and the mass of our Galaxy is found to be 220 billion solar masses times the M/L ratio of Sculptor.

  abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) appear to be some of the most dark matter (DM)-dominated objects in the Universe. Their dynamical masses are commonly derived using the kinematics of stars under the assumption of equilibrium. However, these objects are satellites of massive galaxies (e.g. the Milky Way) and thus can be influenced by their tidal fields. We investigate the implication of the assumption of equilibrium focusing on the Sculptor dSph by means of ad hoc N-body simulations tuned to reproduce the observed properties of Sculptor following the evolution along some observationally motivated orbits in the Milky Way gravitational field. For this purpose, we used state-of-the-art spectroscopic and photometric samples of Sculptor's stars. We found that the stellar component of the simulated object is not directly influenced by the tidal field, while \{{$\approx$} \} 30 - 60\{\{ per cent\}\} of the mass of the more diffuse DM halo is stripped. We conclude that, considering the most recent estimate of the Sculptor proper motion, the system is not affected by the tides and the stellar kinematics represents a robust tracer of the internal dynamics. In the simulations that match the observed properties of Sculptor, the present-day dark-to-luminous mass ratio is {$\approx$}6 within the stellar half-light radius ({$\approx$}0.3 kpc) and {$>$}50 within the maximum radius of the analysed data set ({$\approx$}1.5{$^\circ$}, {$\approx$}2 kpc).},

  abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach{\'o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r {$\sim$} 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

  abstract = {The 'core-cusp' problem is considered a key challenge to the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm. Haloes in dark matter only simulations exhibit 'cuspy' profiles, where density continuously increases towards the centre. However, the dark matter profiles of many observed galaxies (particularly in the dwarf regime) deviate strongly from this prediction, with much flatter central regions ('cores'). We use NewHorizon (NH), a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, to investigate core formation, using a statistically significant number of galaxies in a cosmological volume. Haloes containing galaxies in the upper (M{$\star$} {$\geq$} 1010.2 M{$\odot$}) and lower (M{$\star$} {$\leq$} 108 M{$\odot$}) ends of the stellar mass distribution contain cusps. However, Haloes containing galaxies with intermediate (108 M{$\odot$} {$\leq$} M{$\star$} {$\leq$} 1010.2 M{$\odot$}) stellar masses are generally cored, with typical halo masses between 1010.2 M{$\odot$} and 1011.5 M{$\odot$}. Cores form through supernova-driven gas removal from halo centres, which alters the central gravitational potential, inducing dark matter to migrate to larger radii. While all massive (M{$\star$} {$\geq$} 109.5 M{$\odot$}) galaxies undergo a cored-phase, in some cases cores can be removed and cusps reformed. This happens if a galaxy undergoes sustained star formation at high redshift, which results in stars (which, unlike the gas, cannot be removed by baryonic feedback) dominating the central gravitational potential. After cosmic star formation peaks, the number of cores, and the mass of the Haloes they are formed in, remain constant, indicating that cores are being routinely formed over cosmic time after a threshold halo mass is reached. The existence of cores is, therefore, not in tension with the standard paradigm.},

  abstract = {We present the discovery of rotation in quenched, low-mass early-type galaxies that are isolated. This finding challenges the claim that (all) rotating dwarf early-type galaxies in clusters were once spiral galaxies that have since been harassed and transformed into early-type galaxies. Our search of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data within the Local Volume (z~\&lt;~0.02) has yielded a sample of 46 galaxies with a stellar mass M{$\star$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 5~{\texttimes}~109\,M{$\odot$} (median M{$\star~\sim~$}9.29~{\texttimes}~108\,M{$\odot$}), a low H{$\alpha$} equivalent width EWH{$\alpha~\&$}lt;~2 {\AA}, and no massive neighbour (M{$\star$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 3~{\texttimes}~1010 M{$\odot$}) within a velocity interval of {$\Delta$}V~=~500\,km\,s-1 and a projected distance of {$\sim$}1~Mpc. Nine of these galaxies were subsequently observed with Keck Echellette Spectrograph and Imager and their radial kinematics are presented here. These extend out to the half-light radius Re in the best cases, and beyond Re/2 for all. They reveal a variety of behaviours similar to those of a comparison sample of early-type dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster observed by Toloba et~al. Both samples have similar frequencies of slow and fast rotators, as well as kinematically decoupled cores. This, and especially the finding of rotating quenched low-mass galaxies in isolation, reveals that the early-type dwarfs in galaxy clusters need not be harassed or tidally stirred spiral galaxies.},

A comparison of different simulations suggests that the dominant uncertainty in our results is systematic and is smaller than 10-30per cent at all masses, depending on the halo definition used. In particular, our `Hubble volume' simulations of {$\tau$}CDM and {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmologies allow the abundance of massive clusters to be predicted with uncertainties well below those expected in all currently planned observational surveys. We show that for a range of CDM cosmologies and for a suitable halo definition, the simulated mass function is almost independent of epoch, of cosmological parameters and of the initial power spectrum when expressed in appropriate variables. This universality is of exactly the kind predicted by the familiar Press-Schechter model, although this model predicts a mass function shape that differs from our numerical results, overestimating the abundance of `typical' haloes and underestimating that of massive systems.},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are valuable laboratories for dynamical studies related to dark matter and galaxy evolution, yet it is currently unknown just how physically extended their stellar components are. Satellites orbiting the Galaxy's potential may undergo tidal stripping by the host, or alternatively, may themselves have accreted smaller systems whose debris populates the dwarf's own stellar halo. Evidence of these past interactions, if present, is best searched for in the outskirts of the satellite. However, foreground contamination dominates the signal at these large radial distances, making observation of stars in these regions difficult. In this work, we introduce an updated algorithm for application to Gaia data that identifies candidate member stars of dwarf galaxies, based on spatial, colour-magnitude and proper motion information, and which allows for an outer component to the stellar distribution. Our method shows excellent consistency with spectroscopically confirmed members from the literature despite having no requirement for radial velocity information. We apply the algorithm to all {\textasciitilde}60 Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites, and we find nine dwarfs (Bo{\"o}tes 1, Bo{\"o}tes 3, Draco 2, Grus 2, Segue 1, Sculptor, Tucana 2, Tucana 3, and Ursa Minor) that exhibit evidence for a secondary, low-density outer profile. We identify many member stars which are located beyond 5 half-light radii (and in some cases, beyond 10). We argue these distant stars are likely tracers of dwarf stellar haloes or tidal streams, though ongoing spectroscopic follow-up will be required to determine the origin of these extended stellar populations.},

We show that, outside of 300 pc from the centre, the S{\'e}rsic profile parameters vary continuously from ``normal'' to ``dwarf'' ellipticals. The ``dichotomy'' is indeed restricted to the very central part, where differences also exist among ``normal'' ellipticals (E). Bright, nucleated dE's closely resemble ``normal'' E's also in their clustering and flattening properties. They may be genuine ellipticals, having no present-day late-type dwarf precursor from which they could have been manufactured. The non-nucleated dE's ("dwarf spheroidals") may be a different breed.},

  abstract = {We establish the connection between the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and the dwarf galaxy candidates discovered in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) by building a dynamical model of the MC satellite populations, based on an extensive suite of tailor-made numerical simulations. Our model takes into account the response of the Galaxy to the MCs infall, the dynamical friction experienced by the MCs and the disruption of the MC satellites by their hosts. The simulation suite samples over the uncertainties in the MC's proper motions, the masses of the MW and the Clouds themselves, and allows for flexibility in the intrinsic volume density distribution of the MC satellites. As a result, we can accurately reproduce the DES satellites' observed positions and kinematics. Assuming that Milky Way (MW) dwarfs follow the distribution of sub-haloes in {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter, we further demonstrate that, of 14 observed satellites, the MW halo contributes fewer than 4(8) of these with 68(95) per cent confidence and that 7(12) DES dwarfs have probabilities greater than 0.7(0.5) of belonging to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Marginalizing over the entire suite, we constrain the number of Magellanic satellites in the range -7 {$<$} MV {$<$} -1 which exceed the DES surface brightness threshold at {$\sim$}70, and the mass of the LMC around 1011 M{$\odot$}. The data also strongly support a first-infall scenario for the LMC. Finally, we give predictions for the line-of-sight velocities and the proper motions of the satellites discovered in the vicinity of the LMC.},

We build stellar population models, predicting colours, spectra and chemical abundances. We compare our predictions with observed values of metallicity and colours for LSBs, and find excellent agreement with all observables. In particular, integrated colours, colour gradients, surface brightness and metallicity match very well to the observed values of LSBs for models with ages larger than 7 Gyr and high values ({$\lambda$} \&gt; 0.05) for the spin parameter of the haloes. We also compute the global star formation rate (SFR) in the Universe due to LSBs, and show that it has a flatter evolution with redshift than the corresponding SFR for normal discs. We furthermore compare the evolution in redshift of [Zn/H] for our models to those observed in damped Lyman {$\alpha$} systems by Pettini et al. and show that damped Lyman {$\alpha$} system abundances are consistent with the predicted abundances at different radii for LSBs.

We find that existing observations are not sufficient to allow us to place precise limits on either the orbit or the initial state of the dwarf. Debris from the ongoing tidal stripping of the Sagittarius galaxy are expected to form moving groups in the halo of the Galaxy, and the discovery of such stars would strongly constrain the history and dynamical state of the dwarf Furthermore, if Sgr is presently being disrupted, we predict that its remains will be detectable as a moving group in the halo for more than 1 Gyr. Thus, if similar accretion events have occurred in the recent history of the Galaxy, their after effects may still be observable.},

We use imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) to measure the shapes of dwarf galaxies out to four effective radii for a sample of 6758 dwarfs at 0.005 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.2 and 107.0 {$<$} M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 109.6. We find that dwarfs are slightly triaxial, with (where the ellipsoid is characterized by three principal semiaxes constrained by C {$\leq$} B {$\leq$} A). At M{$\star$} {$>$} 108.5 M{$\odot$}, the galaxies grow from thick disk-like at one effective radius toward the spheroidal extreme at four effective radii. We also see that although blue dwarfs are, on average, characterized by thinner disks than red dwarfs, both blue and red dwarfs grow more spheroidal as a function of radius. This relation also holds true for a comparison between field and satellite dwarfs. This uniform trend toward relatively spheroidal shapes as a function of radius is consistent with an in situ formation mechanism for stellar outskirts around low-mass galaxies, in agreement with proposed models where star formation feedback produces round stellar outskirts around dwarfs.},

The first two epochs, the subject of past analyses, were obtained with ACS/HRC, and have been reanalyzed here. The new third epoch with WFC3/UVIS increases the time baseline and provides better control of systematics. The three-epoch data yield proper-motion random errors of only 1\%-2\% per field. For the LMC this is sufficient to constrain the internal proper-motion dynamics, as will be discussed in a separate paper. Here we focus on the implied center-of-mass proper motions: {$\mu$} W, LMC = -1.910 {\textpm} 0.020 mas yr-1, {$\mu$} N, LMC = 0.229 {\textpm} 0.047 mas yr-1, and {$\mu$} W, SMC = -0.772 {\textpm} 0.063 mas yr-1, {$\mu$} N, SMC = -1.117 {\textpm} 0.061 mas yr-1. We combine the results with a revised understanding of the solar motion in the Milky Way to derive Galactocentric velocities: v tot, LMC = 321 {\textpm} 24 km s-1 and v tot, SMC = 217 {\textpm} 26 km s-1. Our proper-motion uncertainties are now dominated by limitations in our understanding of the internal kinematics and geometry of the Clouds, and our velocity uncertainties are dominated by distance errors. Orbit calculations for the Clouds around the Milky Way allow a range of orbital periods, depending on the uncertain masses of the Milky Way and LMC. Periods {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 4 Gyr are ruled out, which poses a challenge for traditional Magellanic Stream models. First-infall orbits are preferred (as supported by other arguments as well) if one imposes the requirement that the LMC and SMC must have been a bound pair for at least several Gyr.},

Light curves in the V band were obtained for 226 RR Lyr stars and for 3 anomalous cepheids. One previously unknown anomalous cepheid was identified. We also discovered two variables located at the tip of the red giant branch of Sculptor. Out of 226 RR Lyr variables 134 were classified as RRab, 89 as RRc and one as RRd. The distribution of the periods for RRab stars shows a sharp cut-off at P=0.475 day. This implies that the bulk of Sculptor RR Lyr stars has metallicity [Fe/H]{$<$}=-1.7 on the Zinn-West scale. The average V magnitudes of RRab variables are correlated with their periods. This effect is most probably caused by the spread of metallicities exhibited by the variables. Based on the average V magnitudes of RR Lyr stars the apparent distance modulus of Sculptor was determined to be (m-M)\_V\_=19.71. We present a new color-magnitude diagram of Sculptor reaching V={\textasciitilde}21.4 and I={\textasciitilde}20.6. The observed width of the upper part of the red giant branch indicates a range of metallicities (-2.2{$<$}=[Fe/H]{$<$}=-1.6) for the Sculptor giants. The observed distribution of stars along the horizontal branch and the average metallicity imply that age of Sculptor is similar to that of the relatively young globular clusters from the outer galactic halo. The data on RR Lyr variables in four nearby dwarf galaxies are summarized and discussed briefly.},

We develop a model for tidal mass loss, based upon the phase-space distribution of particles, which accounts for how both tidal and Coriolis torques perturb the angular momentum of each particle in the system. This allows us to study how both the density profile and velocity anisotropy affect the degree of mass loss - we present basic results from such a study. Our model predicts that mass loss is a continuous process even in a static tidal field, a consequence of the fact that mass loss weakens the potential of the system making it easier for further mass loss to occur. We compare the predictions of our model with N-body simulations of idealized systems in order to check its validity. We find reasonable agreement with the N-body simulations except for in the case of very strong tidal fields, where our results suggest that a higher order perturbation analysis may be required. The continuous tidally induced mass loss predicted by our model can lead to substantial reduction in satellite mass in cases where the traditional treatment predicts no mass loss. As such, our results may have important consequences for the orbits and survival of low-mass satellites in dark matter haloes.},

Our calculations reproduce these observations as the result of a steep metallicity gradient within a single population, induced by dissipative collapse of the gas component.

  abstract = {The structural evolution of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) models is investigated combining ``low-resolution'' satellites from cosmological N-body simulations of parent halos with N=107 particles with high-resolution individual subhalos orbiting within a static host potential. We show that, as a result of mass loss, convergence in the central density profiles requires the initial satellites to be resolved with N=107 particles and parsec-scale force resolution. We find that the density profiles of substructure halos can be well fitted with a power-law central slope that is unmodified by tidal forces even after the tidal stripping of over 99\% of the initial mass and an exponential cutoff in the outer parts. The solution to the missing-satellites problem advocated by Stoehr et al. in 2002 relied on the flattening of the dark matter halo central density cusps by gravitational tides, enabling the observed satellites to be embedded within dark halos with maximum circular velocities as large as 60 km s-1. In contrast, our results suggest that tidal interactions do not provide the mechanism for associating the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Milky Way with the most massive substructure halos expected in a CDM universe. Motivated by the structure of our stripped satellites, we compare the predicted velocity dispersion profiles of Fornax and Draco to observations, assuming that they are embedded in CDM halos. We demonstrate that models with isotropic and tangentially anisotropic velocity distributions for the stellar component fit the data only if the surrounding dark matter halos have maximum circular velocities in the range 20-35 km s-1. If the dSphs are embedded within halos this large, then the overabundance of satellites within the concordance {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model is significantly alleviated, but this still does not provide the entire solution.},

The DM halo models are constructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to corelike profiles and the structural properties of the galaxy models are motivated by the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm of structure formation. The adopted force resolution allows robust density profile estimates in the inner {\textasciitilde}1\% of the virial radii of the simulated systems. We demonstrate that the central slopes and overall shapes of the remnant density profiles are virtually identical to those of the initial systems, suggesting that the remnants retain a remarkable memory of the density structure of their progenitors, despite the relaxation that accompanies merger activity. We also find that halo concentrations remain approximately constant through hierarchical merging involving identical systems and show that remnants contain significant fractions of their bound mass well beyond their formal virial radii. These conclusions hold for a wide variety of initial asymptotic density slopes, orbital energies, and encounter configurations, including sequences of consecutive merger events, simultaneous mergers of several systems, and mergers of halos with embedded cold baryonic components in the form of disks, spheroids, or both. As an immediate consequence, the net effect of gas cooling, which contracts and steepens the inner density profiles of DM halos, should be preserved through a period of dissipationless major merging. Our results imply that the characteristic universal shape of DM density profiles may be set early in the evolution of halos.},

However, its normalisation, slope, and scatter are highly uncertain at dwarf galaxy scales. In this paper, we present DarkLight, a new semi-empirical dwarf galaxy formation model designed to robustly predict the SMHM relation for the smallest galaxies. DarkLight harnesses a correlation between the mean star formation rate of dwarfs and their peak rotation speed -- the \${\textbackslash}langle\$SFR\${\textbackslash}rangle\$-\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ relation -- that we derive from simulations and observations. Given the sparsity of data for isolated dwarfs with \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 20\$ km/s, we fit the \${\textbackslash}langle\$SFR\${\textbackslash}rangle\$-\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ relation to observational data for dwarfs above this velocity scale and to the high-resolution EDGE cosmological simulations below. Reionisation quenching is implemented via distinct \${\textbackslash}langle\$SFR\${\textbackslash}rangle\$-\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ relations before and after reionisation. We find that the SMHM scatter is small at reionisation, \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.2 dex, but rises to \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.5 dex (\$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$) at a halo mass of \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\${\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ as star formation is quenched by reionisation but dark matter halo masses continue to grow. While we do not find a significant break in the slope of the SMHM relation, one can be introduced if reionisation occurs early (\$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm quench\} rsim 5\$). Finally, we find that dwarfs can be star forming today down to a halo mass of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 \${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We predict that the lowest mass star forming dwarf irregulars in the nearby universe are the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of quiescent isolated dwarfs.},

  abstract = {A critical challenge to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm is that there are fewer satellites observed around the Milky Way than found in simulations of dark matter substructure. We show that there is a match between the observed satellite counts corrected by the detection efficiency of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (for luminosities L {$\greaterequivlnt$}340 L{$\odot$} ) and the number of luminous satellites predicted by CDM, assuming an empirical relation between stellar mass and halo mass. The "missing satellites problem," cast in terms of number counts, is thus solved. We also show that warm dark matter models with a thermal relic mass smaller than 4 keV are in tension with satellite counts, putting pressure on the sterile neutrino interpretation of recent x-ray observations. Importantly, the total number of Milky Way satellites depends sensitively on the spatial distribution of satellites, possibly leading to a "too many satellites" problem. Measurements of completely dark halos below 1 08 M{$\odot$}, achievable with substructure lensing and stellar stream perturbations, are the next frontier for tests of CDM.},

  abstract = {New observations make it possible to re-examine the question of the density distribution in globular clusters. Jeans' law is based on insufficient observations and on an incorrect theory. On Palomar Schmidt plates the densities can be followed far enough out to define a limit to a globular cluster. The observed loca- tion of this limit agrees with the limit to be expected as a result of galactic tidal forces. The central regions of all globular clusters are similar, except for the effect of the tidal cutoff. An empirical formula has been found that represents the density from center to edge in globular clusters of all degrees of central concen- tration. The formula has three parameters, which is the minimum number permitted by the physical circum- stances. Globular clusters are therefore as similar in structure as they could possibly be. Galactic clusters and Sculptor-type dwarf galaxies also appear to follow the same density law. From dynamical considerations it would appear that all these stellar systems are subject to two types of relaxation, which produce nearly identical effects. The first relaxation is produced by the initial mixing of the system. Thereupon stellar encounters slowly change the density parameters without affecting the basic law. Relative to globular clusters, giant elliptical galaxies have an excess of brightness near the center. This difference can be explained as a result of relaxation, equipartition, and an excess of dwarf stars.},

The models are spatially limited, corresponding to the tidal cutoff imposed by the Milky Way. Their projected density distributions are similar to those observed in open clusters, globular clusters, and elliptical galaxies. Within each model the fractional escape rate is uniform throughout. The escape rate from a cluster depends on the number of stars and the strength of the tidal force field; when expressed in this way it is almost independent of core radius or central concentration. Quantitative application to actual clusters must await a discussion of models containing a realistic stellar mixture.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti abundances for 388 radial velocity member stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph), a satellite of the Milky Way (MW). This is the largest sample of individual {$\alpha$} element (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) abundance measurements in any single dSph. The measurements are made from Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrometer medium-resolution spectra (6400-9000 {\AA}, R {\textasciitilde} 6500). Based on comparisons to published high-resolution (R gsim 20,000) spectroscopic measurements, our measurements have uncertainties of {$\sigma$}[Fe/H] = 0.14 and {$\sigma$}[{$\alpha$}/Fe] = 0.13. The Sculptor [Fe/H] distribution has a mean lang[Fe/H]rang = -1.58 and is asymmetric with a long, metal-poor tail, indicative of a history of extended star formation. Sculptor has a larger fraction of stars with [Fe/H] {$<$} -2 than the MW halo. We have discovered one star with [Fe/H] = -3.80 {\textpm} 0.28, which is the most metal-poor star known anywhere except the MW halo, but high-resolution spectroscopy is needed to measure this star's detailed abundances. As has been previously reported based on high-resolution spectroscopy, [{$\alpha$}/Fe] in Sculptor falls as [Fe/H] increases. The metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.5) have lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe] than Galactic halo field stars of comparable metallicity. This indicates that star formation proceeded more gradually in Sculptor than in the Galactic halo. We also observe radial abundance gradients of -0.030 {\textpm} 0.003 dex arcmin-1 in [Fe/H] and +0.013 {\textpm} 0.003 dex arcmin-1 in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] out to 11 arcmin (275 pc). Together, these measurements cast Sculptor and possibly other surviving dSphs as representative of the dwarf galaxies from which the metal-poor tail of the Galactic halo formed.},

The uniformity of the relation is in contradiction to previous estimates of metallicity based on photometry. This relationship is roughly continuous with the stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation for galaxies as massive as M * = 1012 M {$\odot$}. Although the average metallicities of dwarf galaxies depend only on stellar mass, the shapes of their metallicity distributions depend on galaxy type. The metallicity distributions of dIrrs resemble simple, leaky box chemical evolution models, whereas dSphs require an additional parameter, such as gas accretion, to explain the shapes of their metallicity distributions. Furthermore, the metallicity distributions of the more luminous dSphs have sharp, metal-rich cut-offs that are consistent with the sudden truncation of star formation due to ram pressure stripping. The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M.

Separation of dwarf stars from foreground stars by color allows a robust estimation of the structural parameters of UMi. We examine earlier evidence of two lumps in the UMi stellar distribution. We detect a statistically significant asymmetry in the stellar distribution of UMi along the major axis. Structure in the stellar distribution of UMi might indicate a tidal origin for UMi's high observed mass-to-light ratio. We demonstrate a technique for obtaining the absolute magnitude of UMi from horizontal-branch star counts compared with M92; this method of luminosity estimation is independent of the distance to UMi. We obtain M\_V=-8.87+/-sigmaM\_V, where sigmaM\_V=0.14 if M92 is a perfect calibrator and sigmaM\_V{$<$}{\textasciitilde}0.35 is an upper bound on the error arising from differences in stellar populations.

Previous studies of dSph stellar distributions have concentrated principally on the spatial distribution of stars or on computation of a global velocity dispersion. A detailed understanding of the spatial behavior of the velocity distribution, however, is necessary to distinguish among competing theories of dSph dynamics. Here we apply a maximum-likelihood technique to fit the set of individual velocity measurements to a global distribution. Rather than calculating mean local velocity dispersions in regions where the data are sparse, this technique has the advantage of using the velocity measurements individually. We confirm earlier findings of a radial falloff in the velocity distribution of UMi, which is consistent with a mass-follows-light (MFL) King model. We also confirm an apparent radial rise in the velocity dispersion of Draco. However, these data do not suffice to distinguish among extended halo and MFL models. Finally, we perform simulations to determine the number of additional observations required to clearly differentiate between different dynamical models. Only {\textasciitilde}10-20 additional observations at 0.75 times the tidal radius would be required to distinguish clearly between an MFL distribution and an extended halo or disrupted remnant model with a flat or radially rising velocity dispersion. We describe a method for treating the effect of binary stars, which may be a source of contamination.},

Somewhat anomalously, it appears to contain morphological substructure in the form of a second peak in the stellar number density. It is often argued that this substructure must be transient, because it could not survive for the {\textasciitilde}12 Gyr age of the system, given the crossing time implied by UMi's 8.8 km s-1 internal velocity dispersion. In this Letter, however, we present evidence that the substructure has a cold kinematical signature and argue that UMi's clumpiness could indeed be a primordial artefact. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that substructure is incompatible with the cusped dark matter halos predicted by the prevailing cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm but is consistent with an unbound stellar cluster sloshing back and forth within the nearly harmonic potential of a cored dark matter halo. Thus, CDM appears to disagree with observation at the least massive, most dark matter-dominated end of the galaxy mass spectrum.},

  abstract = {We study the origin and properties of the population of unbound stars in the kinematic samples of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. For this purpose we have run a high-resolution N-body simulation of a two-component dwarf galaxy orbiting in a Milky Way potential. In agreement with the tidal stirring scenario of Mayer et al., the dwarf is placed on a highly eccentric orbit, its initial stellar component is in the form of an exponential disc and it has a NFW-like dark matter (DM) halo. After 10 Gyr of evolution the dwarf produces a spheroidal stellar component and is strongly tidally stripped so that mass follows light and the stars are on almost isotropic orbits. From this final state, we create mock kinematic data sets for 200 stars by observing the dwarf in different directions. We find that when the dwarf is observed along the tidal tails the kinematic samples are strongly contaminated by unbound stars from the tails. We also study another source of possible contamination by adding stars from the Milky Way. We demonstrate that most of the unbound stars can be removed by the method of interloper rejection proposed by den Hartog \& Katgert and recently tested on simulated DM haloes. We model the cleaned-up kinematic samples using solutions of the Jeans equation with constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and velocity anisotropy parameter. We show that even for such a strongly stripped dwarf the Jeans analysis, when applied to cleaned samples, allows us to reproduce the mass and M/L of the dwarf with accuracy typically better than 25 per cent and almost exactly in the case when the line of sight is perpendicular to the tidal tails. The analysis was applied to the new data for the Fornax dSph galaxy. We show that after careful removal of interlopers the velocity dispersion profile of Fornax can be reproduced by a model in which mass traces light with a M/L of 11 solar units and isotropic orbits. We demonstrate that most of the contamination in the kinematic sample of Fornax probably originates from the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {We conduct high-resolution collisionless N-body simulations to investigate the tidal evolution of dwarf galaxies on an eccentric orbit in the Milky Way (MW) potential. The dwarfs originally consist of a low surface brightness stellar disc embedded in a cosmologically motivated dark matter halo. During 10 Gyr of dynamical evolution and after five pericentre passages, the dwarfs suffer substantial mass loss and their stellar component undergoes a major morphological transformation from a disc to a bar and finally to a spheroid. The bar is preserved for most of the time as the angular momentum is transferred outside the galaxy. A dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy is formed via gradual shortening of the bar. This work thus provides a comprehensive quantitative explanation of a potentially crucial morphological transformation mechanism for dwarf galaxies that operates in groups as well as in clusters. We compare three cases with different initial inclinations of the disc and find that the evolution is fastest when the disc is coplanar with the orbit. Despite the strong tidal perturbations and mass loss, the dwarfs remain dark matter dominated. For most of the time, the one-dimensional stellar velocity dispersion, {$\sigma$}, follows the maximum circular velocity, Vmax, and they are both good tracers of the bound mass. Specifically, we find that Mbound {\textasciitilde} V3.5max and in agreement with earlier studies based on pure dark matter simulations. The latter relation is based on directly measuring the stellar kinematics of the simulated dwarf, and may thus be reliably used to map the observed stellar velocity dispersions of dSphs to halo circular velocities when addressing the missing satellites problem.},

The stellar component of the dwarf is initially in the form of a disc and the galaxy is placed on an eccentric orbit motivated by cold dark matter based cosmological simulations. We measure the orientation, density and velocity distribution of the stars in the tails. Due to the geometry of the orbit, in the vicinity of the dwarf, where the tails are densest and therefore most likely to be detectable, they are typically oriented towards the MW and not along the orbit. We report on an interesting phenomenon of `tidal tail flipping': on the way from the pericentre to the apocentre, the old tails following the orbit are dissolved and new ones pointing towards the MW are formed over a short time-scale. We also find a tight linear relation between the velocity of stars in the tidal tails and their distance from the dwarf. Using mock data sets, we demonstrate that if dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the vicinity of the MW are tidally affected their kinematic samples are very likely contaminated by tidally stripped stars which tend to artificially inflate the measured velocity dispersion. The effect is stronger for dwarfs on their way from the pericentre to the apocentre due to the formation of new tidal tails after pericentre. Realistic mass estimates of dSph galaxies thus require removal of these stars from kinematic samples.},

  abstract = {Predicting structural properties of dark matter haloes is one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the suite of MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. We find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter haloes and to make 1-2 per cent accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. For massive haloes, the average density profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter {$\alpha$} in the Einasto approximation. We show that haloes progress through three stages of evolution. They start as rare density peaks and experience fast and nearly radial infall that brings mass closer to the centre, producing a highly concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the {$\alpha$} parameter with a nearly constant core radius. Later haloes slide into the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. At this stage, the concentration does not depend on halo mass. Once the rate of accretion and merging slows down, haloes move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant.

  abstract = {We describe an algorithm for constructing N-body realizations of equilibrium spherical systems. A general form for the mass density {$\rho$}(r) is used, making it possible to represent most of the popular density profiles found in the literature, including the cuspy density profiles found in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We demonstrate explicitly that our models are in equilibrium. In contrast, many existing N-body realizations of isolated systems have been constructed under the assumption that the local velocity distribution is Maxwellian. We show that a Maxwellian halo with an initial {$\rho$}(r){\textasciitilde}r-1 central density cusp immediately develops a constant-density core. Moreover, after just one crossing time the orbital anisotropy has changed over the entire system, and the initially isotropic model becomes radially anisotropic. These effects have important implications for many studies, including the survival of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Comparing the evolution and mass-loss rate of isotropic Maxwellian and self-consistent Navarro, Frenk, \& White (NFW), satellites orbiting inside a static host CDM potential, we find that the former are unrealistically susceptible to tidal disruption. Thus, recent studies of the mass-loss rate and disruption timescales of substructure in CDM models may be compromised by using the Maxwellian approximation. We also demonstrate that a radially anisotropic, self-consistent NFW satellite loses mass at a rate several times higher than that of its isotropic counterpart on the same external tidal field and orbit.},

We reconstruct the proper motion, radial velocity, distance, on-sky track, and stellar density along the stream with spline models. The stream has a total luminosity of MV = -8.2 and metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.9, similar to classical Milky Way (MW) satellites like Draco. The stream shows drastic changes in its physical width varying from 200 pc to 1 kpc, but a constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 5 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$. Despite the large apparent variation in the stellar number density along the stream, the flow rate of stars along the stream is remarkably constant. We model the 6D stream track by a Lagrange-point stripping method with a flexible MW potential in the presence of a moving extended Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This allows us to constrain the mass profile of the MW within the distance range 15.6 {$<$} r {$<$} 55.5 kpc, with the best measured enclosed mass of \$(2.85{\textbackslash}pm 0.1){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ within 32.4 kpc.

We also detect that the LMC dark matter halo extends to at least 53 kpc. The fitting of the OC stream allows us to constrain the past LMC trajectory and the degree of dynamical friction it experienced. We demonstrate that the stars in the OC stream show large energy and angular momentum spreads caused by LMC perturbation.},

Within the red giant branch population, we find evidence for the presence of three distinct stellar subpopulations with different metallicities, spatial distributions, kinematics and ages. As in the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf spheroidals, the subpopulation with the lowest average metallicity is more extended and kinematically hotter than all other populations. However, we identify an inversion in the parallel ordering of metallicity, kinematics and characteristic length-scale in the two most metal-rich subpopulations, which therefore do not contribute to a global negative chemical gradient. Contrary to common trends in the chemical properties with radius, the metal richest population is more extended and mildly kinematically hotter than the main component of intermediate metallicity. More investigations are required to ascertain the nature of this inversion, but we comment on the mechanisms that might have caused it.},

  abstract = {Using collisionless N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, we construct realistic models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group. The dwarfs are initially composed of stellar discs embedded in dark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on an eccentric orbit typical for Milky Way subhaloes. After a few Gyr of evolution, the stellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidal forces. Observing the simulated dwarfs along the three principal axes of the stellar component, we create mock data sets and determine the corresponding half-light radii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. Using the estimator proposed by Wolf et al., we calculate the masses within half-light radii. The masses obtained in this way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of 2 when the line of sight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. We then divide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population and trace their evolution in time. The two populations, although strongly affected by tidal forces, retain different density profiles even after a few Gyr of evolution. We measure the half-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populations along different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the mass distribution in the dwarf galaxies following the method recently proposed by Walker \& Pe{\~n}arrubia. The inferred slopes are systematically over- or underestimated, depending on the line of sight. In particular, when the dwarf is seen along the longest axis of the stellar component, a significantly shallower density profile is inferred than the real one measured from the simulations. Given that most dSph galaxies in the Local Group are non-spherical in appearance and their orientation with respect to our line of sight is unknown, but most probably random, the method can be reliably applied only to a large sample of dwarfs when these systematic errors are expected to be diminished.},

The model satellites are disrupted after several perigalactic passages, but orbiting condensations in phase space can clearly be identified as remnants well after this event. An intrinsic ( M/L) true {$<$} 3 leads to long-lived model remnants that show, as seen from Earth, a tantalizingly close resemblance to observed dSph satellites with ( M/L) obs {$>$} 10 . The reason for large ( M/L) obs is that the remnants have non-isotropic velocity dispersions, are non-spherical and are not in dynamical equilibrium. The remnants fade with time (i.e. orbital phase) and ( M/L) obs increases indicating a correlation between brightness and ( M/L) obs as in the observed dSph sample. The observed correlation between central surface brightness and integrated absolute magnitude is also approximately reproduced by model remnants of different dynamical age. A possibly useful method for probing the line-of-sight extension of a dSph galaxy is suggested. If it is true that most if not all dSph satellites are tidally modified remnants without dark matter then it is plausible that their progenitors may have formed as satellite galaxies in tidal tails during possible early merging events.},

The formulae are an extension of the Press-Schechter model. The dependence of the merger rate on halo mass, epoch, the spectrum of initial density fluctuations and the density parameter {\textohm}0 is explicitly quantified. We calculate the distribution of halo formation times and survival times. We also describe a Monte Carlo method for constructing representative histories of merger events leading to formation of haloes of a prescribed mass.Applying these results to the age distribution of rich clusters of galaxies, we infer that a high value of the density parameter ({\textohm}0 {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.5) is required to reproduce the substantial fraction of rich clusters that exhibit significant substructure, if such substructure only persists for a time 0.2t0 after a merger, where t0 is the present age of the universe. We also investigate the rate of infall of satellite galaxies into galactic discs, by combining our Monte Carlo technique for halo mergers with an estimate of the time required for dynamical friction to erode the orbits of the baryonic cores of the accreted galaxies. We find that, even for {\textohm}0 = 1, the infall rate is low (provided that the satellite orbits are not too eccentric), and that we would expect only a modest fraction of stellar discs to be thickened or disrupted by this process.},

  abstract = {Draco and Ursa Minor both have published velocity dispersions of {\textasciitilde}10 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} implying large amounts of dark matter. Previous assumptions that the dark matter distribution followed the light led to central densities 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than in other dwarf galaxies. I construct models where the stellar distribution function is isothermal and use star counts to constrain the mass distribution. Even with these different assumptions, the dark matter densities are high. For a constant density halo, the best fit values are {$\rho$} {\textasciitilde}0.2 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum} and the lower limits are D {$\rho>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}. Draco is poorly fitted with a uniform density halo, but good fits are obtained using a dark matter distribution with a core radius. In this model, the apparent cut-off radius has nothing to do with galactic tides. For comparison, King's empirical formula was refitted. The derived tidal radii, r\_t\_, are only lower limits, r\_t.D\_ {$>$} 25 arcmin and r\_t.UM\_ {$>$} 35 arcmin. If the dark matter follows the light, then {$\rho\_$}0.D\_ {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.4 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum} and {$\rho\_$}0.UM\_ {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.2 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}. Both have M/L\_V\_ {$>$} 25 M\_sun\_/L\_sun\_. In all the models, the central column density of dark matter is as large as that of bright galaxies, i.e. 100-300M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-2{\textasciicircum}. Since the central surface brightnesses are low, Ursa Minor and Draco are excellent targets for dark matter searches.},

The last alternative is dissipational dark matter. In this case, the additional collapse factor owing to dissipation allows a later epoch of formation. If the dSph's are composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that mutually annihilate, Draco and Ursa Minor are below the threshold for detection with GRO. However, denser or closer lumps might be seen. If their halos are made of brown dwarfs, the dSph's are excellent targets for dark matter searches.},

  abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite observed the full sky in four mid-infrared bands in the 2.8--28 {$\mu$}m range. The primary mission was completed in 2010. The WISE team has done a superb job of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete data releases in a timely manner. However, the ``Atlas Image'' coadds that are part of the recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred. Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in ``matched-filtered'' images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function. This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users should be cautioned, however, that the W3- and W4-band coadds contain artifacts around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc.); eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me.},

  abstract = {P-splines are an attractive approach for modeling nonlinear smooth effects of covariates within the additive and varying coefficient models framework. In this article, we first develop a Bayesian version for P-splines and generalize in a second step the approach in various ways. First, the assumption of constant smoothing parameters can be replaced by allowing the smoothing parameters to be locally adaptive. This is particularly useful in situations with changing curvature of the underlying smooth function or with highly oscillating functions. In a second extension, one-dimensional P-splines are generalized to two-dimensional surface fitting for modeling interactions between metrical covariates. In a last step, the approach is extended to situations with spatially correlated responses allowing the estimation of geoadditive models. Inference is fully Bayesian and uses recent MCMC techniques for drawing random samples from the posterior. In a couple of simulation studies the performance of Bayesian P-splines is studied and compared to other approaches in the literature. We illustrate the approach by two complex application on rents for flats in Munich and on human brain mapping.},

  abstract = {We investigate surface brightness profiles (SBPs) of dwarf galaxies in field, group, and cluster environments. With deep BV I images from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network Supernova Program, SBPs of 38 dwarfs in the NGC 2784 group are fitted by a single-exponential or double-exponential model. We find that 53\% of the dwarfs are fitted with single-exponential profiles (``Type I''), while 47\% of the dwarfs show double-exponential profiles; 37\% of all dwarfs have smaller sizes for the outer part than the inner part (``Type II''), while 10\% have a larger outer than inner part (``Type III''). We compare these results with those in the field and in the Virgo cluster, where the SBP types of 102 field dwarfs are compiled from a previous study and the SBP types of 375 cluster dwarfs are measured using SDSS r-band images. As a result, the distributions of SBP types are different in the three environments. Common SBP types for the field, the NGC 2784 group, and the Virgo cluster are Type II, Type I and II, and Type I and III profiles, respectively. After comparing the sizes of dwarfs in different environments, we suggest that since the sizes of some dwarfs are changed due to environmental effects, SBP types are capable of being transformed and the distributions of SBP types in the three environments are different. We discuss possible environmental mechanisms for the transformation of SBP types. Based on data collected at KMTNet Telescopes and SDSS.},

  abstract = {Observing the first generation of stars, Population III (Pop III), is still a challenge even with the JWST due to their faintness. Instead, searching for fossil records of Pop III stars in nearby dwarf galaxies provides an alternative method for studying their physical properties. It is intriguing that a star recently discovered in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy, named AS0039, is considered to show the unique signature of a Pop III star. The detailed abundance patterns of AS0039 are well matched with those predicted by nucleosynthesis models for Pop III exploding as an energetic hypernova (HN), confirming its potential to provide insight into the properties of the first stars. This study aims to explore the environmental conditions required for the formation of such a unique star using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations on dwarf galaxies with a mass of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}8\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ at z = 0 while varying the fraction of Pop III stars that undergo HNe. Our simulations identify rapid gas inflow (\${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}{\textbackslash}sim 0.08\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) as a possible factor in facilitating the formation of stars similar to AS0039. Alternatively, the delayed formation of subsequent Population II (Pop II) stars in the gas-enriched environment may lead to low-metallicity stars like AS0039. Additionally, using the A-SLOTH code, we investigate the probability of finding remnants of Pop II stars with HN signatures in nearby dwarf satellite galaxies. We suggest that the most likely dwarf galaxies to contain HN signatures are massive satellites with a probability of 40 per cent in the range of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ to\} {\textbackslash} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}7 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ to\} {\textbackslash} 10{\textasciicircum}8\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, considering observational limitations.},

We consider 60 low-mass galaxies with high-quality H I and/or stellar rotation curves (including starbursting dwarfs, irregulars, and spheroidals), and estimate d\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$}\emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}(0) as \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$}, where \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} is the galaxy scale length. For gas-rich dwarfs, we find that \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} correlates with the central surface brightness \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$}, the mean atomic gas surface density {$\Sigma$}\textsubscript{gas{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and the star formation rate surface density {$\Sigma$}\textsubscript{SFR{$<$}sub/{$>$}. Starbursting galaxies, such as blue compact dwarfs (BCDs), generally have higher values of \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} than dwarf irregulars, suggesting that the starburst is closely related to the inner shape of the potential well. There are, however, some ``compact'' irregulars with values of \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} similar to BCDs. Unless a redistribution of mass takes place, BCDs must evolve into compact irregulars. Rotating spheroidals in the Virgo cluster follow the same correlation between \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} as gas-rich dwarfs. They have values of \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} comparable to those of BCDs and compact irregulars, pointing to evolutionary links between these types of dwarfs. Finally, we find that, as for spiral galaxies and massive starbursts, the star-formation activity in dwarfs can be parametrized as {$\Sigma$}\textsubscript{SFR{$<$}sub/{$>$} = \emph{{$\epsilon<$}i/{$>$} {$\Sigma$}\textsubscript{gas{$<$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{orb{$<$}sub/{$>$}, where \emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{orb{$<$}sub/{$>$} is the orbital time and \emph{{$\epsilon<$}i/{$>$} {$\simeq$} 0.02.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

We present the results of a high-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 20 000, {$\lambda$} = 5340-5620; 6120-6701) FLAMES/GIRAFFE abundance study at ESO/VLT of 81 photometrically selected, red giant branch stars in the central 25' of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We also carried out a detailed comparison of the effects of recent developments in abundance analysis (e.g., spherical models vs. plane-parallel) and the automation that is required to efficiently deal with such large data sets. We present abundances of {$\alpha$}-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), iron-peak elements (Fe, Ni, and Cr), and heavy elements (Y, Ba, La, Nd, and Eu). Our sample was randomly selected and is clearly dominated by the younger and more metal-rich component of Fornax, which represents the major fraction of stars in the central region. This means that the majority of our stars are 1-4 Gyr old, and thus represent the end phase of chemical evolution in this system. Our sample of stars has unusually low [ {$\alpha$}/Fe] , [Ni/Fe], and [Na/Fe] compared to the Milky Way stellar populations at the same [Fe/H]. The particularly important role of stellar winds from low-metallicity AGB stars in the creation of s-process elements is clearly seen from the high [Ba/Y]. Furthermore, we present evidence of an s-process origin of Eu.

  abstract = {We present a spectroscopic study of the tidal tails and core of the Milky Way satellite Tucana III, collectively referred to as the Tucana III stream, using the 2dF+AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the IMACS spectrograph on the Magellan Baade Telescope. In addition to recovering the brightest nine previously known member stars in the Tucana III core, we identify 22 members in the tidal tails. We observe strong evidence for a velocity gradient of 8.0+/- 0.4 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1 \{{\textbackslash}deg \}-1 over at least 3{$^\circ$} on the sky. Based on the continuity in velocity, we confirm that the Tucana III tails are real tidal extensions of Tucana III. The large velocity gradient of the stream implies that Tucana III is likely on a radial orbit. We successfully obtain metallicities for four members in the core and 12 members in the tails. We find that members close to the ends of the stream tend to be more metal-poor than members in the core, indicating a possible metallicity gradient between the center of the progenitor halo and its edge. The spread in metallicity suggests that the progenitor of the Tucana III stream is likely a dwarf galaxy rather than a star cluster. Furthermore, we find that with the precise photometry of the Dark Energy Survey data, there is a discernible color offset between metal-rich disk stars and metal-poor stream members. This metallicity-dependent color offers a more efficient method to recognize metal-poor targets and will increase the selection efficiency of stream members for future spectroscopic follow-up programs on stellar streams.},

Galaxy abundances are well determined over almost four orders of magnitude in stellar mass and are reasonably but not perfectly fit by a Schechter function with characteristic stellar mass m* = 6.7 {\texttimes} 1010Msolar and with faint-end slope {$\alpha$} = -1.155. For a standard cosmology and a standard stellar initial mass function, only 3.5 per cent of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp {$<$} 30h-1Mpc. Over the range 10h-1kpc {$<$} rp {$<$} 10h-1Mpc, it is extremely well represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation function is {$\xi$}*(r) = (r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84. Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of 5 for rp {$<$} 1h-1Mpc. This behaviour is approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy formation in the concordance {$\Lambda$}cold dark matter cosmology. Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude {$\sigma$}8 {\textasciitilde} 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger value adopted in the Millennium Simulation models with which we compare our data. This comparison also suggests that observations of stellar mass autocorrelations as a function of redshift might provide a powerful test for the nature of Dark Energy.},

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) contains results for 1.812 billion sources in the magnitude range G = 3-21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, the models, and the processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia EDR3, as well as the validation of these results performed within the astrometry task. Methods: The processing broadly followed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements to the modelling of observations. For the first time in the Gaia data processing, colour-dependent calibrations of the line- and point-spread functions have been used for sources with well-determined colours from DR2. In the astrometric processing these sources obtained five-parameter solutions, whereas other sources were processed using a special calibration that allowed a pseudocolour to be estimated as the sixth astrometric parameter. Compared with DR2, the astrometric calibration models have been extended, and the spin-related distortion model includes a self-consistent determination of basic-angle variations, improving the global parallax zero point. Results: Gaia EDR3 gives full astrometric data (positions at epoch J2016.0, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1.468 billion sources (585 millionwith five-parameter solutions, 882 million with six parameters), and mean positions at J2016.0 for an additional 344 million.Solutions with five parameters are generally more accurate than six-parameter solutions, and are available for 93\% of the sources brighter than the 17th magnitude. The median uncertainty in parallax and annual proper motion is 0.02-0.03 mas at magnitude G = 9-14, and around 0.5 mas at G = 20. Extensive characterisation of the statistical properties of the solutions is provided, including the estimated angular power spectrum of parallax bias from the quasars.},

  abstract = {We use the APOSTLE simulation suite to study the formation of galactic disks, in order to better understand the origin of their vertical structure. We select a disk-dominated Milky Way analogue galaxy from the simulation which experiences a minimum of external interaction with its environment as a generalizable test case. The simulated stellar disk is found to form upside-down from a gradually thinning, flared gaseous disk, where the rate of thinning is regulated by feedback from in-situ star formation. No significant sources of vertical heating are present in the disk, allowing the vertical structure of newly-formed stellar populations to be preserved over time. As a result, the properties of the stellar disk as a function of age accurately trace the properties of the gaseous disk as a function of time. This allows us to derive a physical model, in which the disk is isothermal, in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, and vertically supported by bulk motions rather than thermal pressure, which relates the present-day vertical age-velocity dispersion relation (AVR) at a given radius to the local star formation history as a simple power-law relation, with a best fit power law index \$n=1.82\$. This relation is then applied to the observed AVRs in the Milky Way from the recent literature, providing a predicted local star formation history for the Milky Way as a function of radius. We then compare this predicted history to others from the literature, in order to test whether our upside-down model from the simulation is consistent with the observed Galaxy. We also examine the observed ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersions for consistency with our model. While our predicted history is broadly consistent with other predictions, the range of possible histories in the literature makes a more definitive conclusion difficult.},

We propose an evolutionary model for the origin of And II involving a merger between two discy dwarf galaxies with different disc scalelengths. The dwarfs are placed on a radial orbit towards each other with their angular momenta inclined by 90 deg. The merger remnant forms a stable triaxial galaxy with rotation only around the longest axis whose origin is naturally explained as due to the symmetry of the initial configuration and the conservation of angular momentum components along the direction of the merger. The stars originating from the two dwarfs show significantly different surface density profiles while having very similar kinematics as required by the data. We also study an alternative scenario for the formation of And II, via tidal stirring of a discy dwarf. While intrinsic rotation occurs naturally in this model as a remnant of the initial rotation of the disc, it is mostly around the shortest axis of the stellar component. We conclude that the velocity distribution in And II is much more naturally explained by a scenario involving a past merger.},

Our member selection is more restrictive than the one based on metallicity indicators as it removes not only contamination due to Milky Way stars but also the unbound stars from the tidal tails. We model the cleaned data sets by adjusting the solutions of the Jeans equations to the profiles of the projected velocity dispersion and kurtosis. The data are well reproduced by models where mass follows light and the best-fitting stellar orbits are isotropic to weakly tangential, as expected from the tidal stirring scenario. The Fornax dwarf, with more than 2400 member stars, is a dSph galaxy with the most accurately determined mass to date: its 1{$\sigma$} error following from the sampling errors of the velocity moments is below 5 per cent.

We combine broad-band photometry, proper motions from Gaia, and our Pristine narrow-band and metallicity-sensitive photometry to efficiently weed out the Milky Way contamination. Such cleaning is particularly critical in this kinematic regime, as both the transverse and heliocentric velocities of Milky Way populations overlap with Hercules. Thanks to this method, three new member stars are identified, including one at almost 10rh of the satellite. All three have velocities and metallicities consistent with that of the main body. Combining this new data set with the entire literature cleaned out from contamination shows that Hercules does not exhibit a velocity gradient (d/d{$\chi$} \$= 0.1{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.2\}\$ km s-1 arcmin-1, 1.6 km s-1 arcmin-1 as a 3{$\sigma$} upper limit) and, as such, does not show evidence to undergo tidal disruption.},

  abstract = {The well-established correlations between the mass of massive black holes (BHs) in the nuclei of most studied galaxies and various global properties of their hosting galaxy lend support to the idea that dwarf galaxies and globular clusters could also host a BH in their centers. Direct kinematic detection of BHs in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies is seriously hindered by the small number of stars inside the gravitational influence region of the BH. The aim of this Letter is to establish an upper dynamical limit on the mass of the putative BH in the Ursa Minor (UMi) dSph galaxy. We present direct N-body simulations of the tidal disruption of the dynamical fossil observed in UMi, with and without a massive BH. We find that the observed substructure is incompatible with the presence of a massive BH of (2-3) {\texttimes} 104 M sun within the core of UMi. These limits are consistent with the extrapolation of the M BH-{$\sigma$} relation to the M BH {$<$} 106 M sun regime. We also show that the BH may be off-center with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy.},

  abstract = {Through numerical simulations, we study the dissolution timescale of the Ursa Minor cold stellar clump, due to the combination of phase-mixing and gravitational encounters with compact dark substructures in the halo of Ursa Minor. We compare two scenarios: one where the dark halo is made up by a smooth mass distribution of light particles and one where the halo contains 10\% of its mass in the form of substructures (subhalos). In a smooth halo, the stellar clump survives for a Hubble time provided that the dark matter halo has a large core. In contrast, when the point-mass dark substructures are added, the clump survives for barely {\textasciitilde}1.5 Gyr. These results suggest a strong test of the {$\Lambda$}-cold dark matter scenario at dwarf galaxy scale.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 F555W and F814W survey of 69 dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) in the Virgo and Fornax Clusters and Leo Group. The V-I colors of the dE globular clusters, nuclei, and underlying field-star populations are used to trace the dE star formation histories. We find that the dE globular cluster candidates are as blue as the metal-poor globular clusters of the Milky Way. The observed correlation of the dE globular cluster systems' V-I color with the luminosity of the host dE is strong evidence that the globular clusters were formed within the halos of dEs and do not have a pregalactic origin. Assuming that the majority of dE clusters are old, the mean globular cluster color-host galaxy luminosity correlation implies a cluster metallicity-galaxy luminosity relation of GC{$>$}{\textasciitilde}L0.22+/-0.05B, which is significantly shallower than the field-star metallicity-host galaxy luminosity relationship observed in Local Group dwarfs (FS{$>$}{\textasciitilde}L0.4). The dE stellar envelopes are 0.1-0.2 mag redder in V-I than their globular clusters and nuclei. This color offset implies separate star formation episodes within the dEs for the clusters and field stars, while the very blue colors of two dE nuclei trace a third star formation event in those dEs less than 1 Gyr ago.},

  abstract = {Well-motivated elementary particle candidates for the dark matter, such as the sterile neutrino, behave as warm dark matter (WDM). For particle masses of the order of a keV, free streaming produces a cutoff in the linear fluctuation power spectrum at a scale corresponding to dwarf galaxies. We investigate the abundance and structure of WDM haloes and subhaloes on these scales using high resolution cosmological N-body simulations of galactic haloes of mass similar to the Milky Way's. On scales larger than the free-streaming cutoff, the initial conditions have the same power spectrum and phases as one of the cold dark matter (CDM) haloes previously simulated by Springel et al. as part of the Virgo consortium Aquarius project. We have simulated four haloes with WDM particle masses in the range 1.5-2.3 keV and, for one case, we have carried out further simulations at varying resolution. N-body simulations in which the power spectrum cutoff is resolved are known to undergo artificial fragmentation in filaments producing spurious clumps which, for small masses ({$<$}107 M{$\odot$} in our case) outnumber genuine haloes. We have developed a robust algorithm to identify these spurious objects and remove them from our halo catalogues. We find that the WDM subhalo mass function is suppressed by well over an order magnitude relative to the CDM case for masses {$<$}109 M{$\odot$}. Requiring that there should be at least as many subhaloes as there are observed satellites in the Milky Way leads to a conservative lower limit to the (thermal equivalent) WDM particle mass of {$\sim$} 1.5 keV. WDM haloes and subhaloes have cuspy density distributions that are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White or Einasto profiles. Their central densities are lower for lower WDM particle masses and none of the models we have considered suffering from the `too big to fail' problem recently highlighted by Boylan-Kolchin et al.},

  abstract = {The empirical model of Lu et~al. is updated with recent data of galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs). The model predicts that the slope of galaxy SMFs at z~\&gt;~2 should be quite steep at the low-mass end, beyond the current detection limit, and it is a strong prediction that can be tested against future observations. The model is used to investigate the galaxy star formation and assembly or merger histories in detail. Most of the stars in cluster centrals, corresponding to brightest cluster galaxies in observations, formed earlier than z~{$\approx~$}2 but have been assembled much later. Typically, they have experienced {$\approx$}5 major mergers since their star formation was quenched. Milky Way mass galaxies have had on-going star formation without significant mergers since z~{$\approx~$}2, and are thus free of significant (classic) bulges produced by major mergers. Dwarf galaxies in haloes with Mh~\&lt;~1011\,h-1\,M{$\odot$} or M{$\star~\&$}lt;~109\,M{$\odot$} have experienced a star formation burst at z~\&gt;~2, followed by a nearly constant star formation rate after z~=~1, and the stellar age decreases with stellar mass, contrary to the `downsizing' trend for more massive galaxies. Major mergers are not uncommon during the early burst phase and may result in the formation of old spheroids in dwarf galaxies. We also characterize the stellar population of halo stars in different haloes.},

  abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation series to investigate the relation between the accretion history and mass profile of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. We find that the mean inner density within the scale radius, r-2 (where the halo density profile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical density of the Universe at the time when the virial mass of the main progenitor equals the mass enclosed within r-2. Scaled to these characteristic values of mass and density, the average mass accretion history, expressed in terms of the critical density of the Universe, M({$\rho$}crit(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile, M({$<\rho>$}), at z = 0. Both follow closely the Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) profile, which suggests that the similarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halo accretion histories. Support for this interpretation is provided by outlier haloes whose accretion histories deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show correlated deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles. Fitting both M({$<\rho>$}) and M({$\rho$}crit) with either NFW or Einasto profiles yield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming and extending earlier work that has linked the concentration of a halo with its accretion history. These correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to initial conditions: only haloes whose accretion histories differ greatly from the NFW shape show notable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. As a result, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter haloes, which do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other than CDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of mass profile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strong support for the link between accretion history and halo structure we propose here.},

We extend earlier work on the relation between halo mass profiles and assembly histories to show how the latter may be used to predict concentrations for haloes of all masses and at any redshift. Our results clarify the link between concentration and the `collapse redshift' of a halo as well as why concentration depends on mass and redshift solely through the dimensionless `peak height' mass parameter, {$\nu$}(M, z) = {$\delta$}crit(z)/{$\sigma$}(M, z). We combine these results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the c(M, z) relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through direct simulation. Our model predicts that, at given z, c(M) should deviate systematically from a simple power law at high masses, where concentrations approach a constant value, and at low masses, where concentrations are substantially lower than expected from extrapolating published empirical fits. This correction may reduce the expected self-annihilation boost factor from substructure by about one order of magnitude. The model also reproduces the c(M, z) dependence on cosmological parameters reported in earlier work and thus provides a simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology and the mass-concentration-redshift relation of CDM haloes.},

  abstract = {We use a suite of cosmological simulations to study the mass--concentration--redshift relation, c(M, z), of dark matter haloes. Our simulations include standard {$\Lambda$}-cold dark matter (CDM) models, and additional runs with truncated power spectra, consistent with a thermal warm dark matter (WDM) scenario. We find that the mass profiles of CDM and WDM haloes are self-similar and well approximated by the Einasto profile. The c(M, z) relation of CDM haloes is monotonic: concentrations decrease with increasing virial mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift at fixed mass. The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM haloes are also scale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do not apply to WDM haloes: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the characteristic scale imposed by the power spectrum suppression. Further, the WDM c(M, z) relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass scale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower masses. We show that the assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer its concentration, provided that the total mass of its progenitors is considered (the `collapsed mass history'; CMH), rather than just that of its main ancestor. This exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to derive a simple scaling that reproduces the mass--concentration--redshift relation of both CDM and WDM haloes over a vast range of halo masses and redshifts. Our model therefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift, cosmology and power spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations.},

The objects, DES J0111-1341 and DES J0225+0304, are located at a heliocentric distance of {$\sim$}25 kpc and appear to have old and metal-poor populations. Their distances to the Sagittarius orbital plane, {$\sim$}1.73 kpc (DES J0111-1341) and {$\sim$}0.50 kpc (DES J0225+0304), indicate that they are possibly associated with the Sagittarius dwarf stream. The half-light radius (rh {$\simeq$} 4.55 pc) and luminosity (MV {$\simeq$} +0.3) of DES J0111-1341 are consistent with it being an ultrafaint stellar cluster, while the half-light radius (rh {$\simeq$} 18.55 pc) and luminosity (MV {$\simeq$} -1.1) of DES J0225+0304 place it in an ambiguous region of size-luminosity space between stellar clusters and dwarf galaxies. Determinations of the characteristic parameters of the Sagittarius stream, metallicity spread (-2.18 {$\lessequivlnt$} [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -0.95) and distance gradient (23 kpc {$\lessequivlnt$} D{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 29 kpc), within the DES footprint in the Southern hemisphere, using the same DES data, also indicate a possible association between these systems. If these objects are confirmed through spectroscopic follow-up to be gravitationally bound systems and to share a Galactic trajectory with the Sagittarius stream, DES J0111-1341 and DES J0225+0304 would be the first ultrafaint stellar systems associated with the Sagittarius stream.

Four farther distant globulars of concentration class XII appear to be unrelated. Using the known distances to the optical objects, the parallaxes due to the offset of the Sun from galactic centre are calculated. Not only the Magellanic stream, but also Sculptor and the Draco-Ursa Minor stream are then seen to lie in a plane which is presumably the plane of the orbit of the Magellanic Clouds about the galactic centre. By demanding that all points of the Magellanic stream be precisely in the plane defined by the galactic centre Palomar 13 and the centre of the mass of the Magellanic Clouds, the distances to all points of the stream are calculated from parallax. With both radial velocities and distances known to so many points on the stream, it seems likely that dynamical modelling will yield a much more accurate total mass for the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) have been alternatively predicted to be quite common in the centres of globular clusters or nearly impossible to form and retain in the centres of globular clusters. As it has been recently shown that radio observations are currently the most sensitive observational technique for detecting such objects, we have obtained new deep radio observations of Omega Cen, and have reanalyzed older observations of M 15 in the hope of constraining the masses of possible black holes in their centres. In both cases, upper limits of about 100 {$\mu$}Jy are found atGHz frequencies. We find that if the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate truly represents the spherical accretion rate onto a black hole, then the masses of the black holes in the centres of these two galaxies are severely constrained - with mass limits of less than about 100 solar masses in both cases. If more realistic assumptions are made based on recent work showing the Bondi rate to be a severe overestimate, then the data for Omega Cen are marginally consistent with a black hole of about 1/1000 of the mass of the cluster (i.e. about 1000Msolar). The data for M 15 are then only marginally consistent with previous reports of a {\textasciitilde}2000 solar mass black hole, and we note that there is considerable hope for either detecting the black hole or improving this upper limit with current instrumentation. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the radio source near the core of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is a {\textasciitilde}104-Msolar black hole.},

  abstract = {We have begun a survey of the structure of the Milky Way halo, as well as the halos of other Local Group galaxies, as traced by their constituent giant stars. These giant stars are identified via large-area, CCD photometric campaigns. Here we present the basis for our photometric search method, which relies on the gravity sensitivity of the Mg I triplet+MgH features near 5150 {\AA} in F-K stars, and which is sensed by the flux in the intermediate-band DDO51 filter. Our technique is a simplified variant of the combined Washington/DDO51 four-filter technique described by Geisler, which we modify for the specific purpose of efficiently identifying distant giant stars for follow-up spectroscopic study: We show here that for most stars the Washington T1-T2 color is correlated monotonically with the Washington M-T2 color with relatively low scatter; for the purposes of our survey, this correlation obviates the need to image in the T1 filter, as originally proposed by Geisler. To calibrate our (M-T2, M-DDO51) diagram as a means to discriminate field giant stars from nearby dwarfs, we utilize new photometry of the main sequences of the open clusters NGC 3680 and NGC 2477 and the red giant branches of the clusters NGC 3680, Melotte 66, and {$\omega$} Centauri, supplemented with data on field stars, globular clusters and open clusters by Doug Geisler and collaborators. By combining the data on stars from different clusters, and by taking advantage of the wide abundance spread within {$\omega$} Centauri, we verify the primary dependence of the M-DDO51 color on luminosity and demonstrate the secondary sensitivity to metallicity among giant stars. Our empirical results are found to be generally consistent with those from analysis of synthetic spectra by Paltoglou \& Bell. Finally, we provide conversion formulae from the (M, M-T2) system to the (V, V-I) system, corresponding reddening laws, as well as empirical red giant branch curves from {$\omega$} Centauri stars for use in deriving photometric parallaxes for giant stars of various metallicities (but equivalent ages) to those of {$\omega$} Centauri giants.},

The galaxy was resolved into stars with Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 including old red giant branch and red clump. We have constructed a model of the resolved stellar populations and measured the star formation rate and metallicity as a function of time. The main star formation activity period occurred about 12.6-13.7 Gyr ago. These stars are mostly metal poor, with a mean metallicity [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -1 to -1.6 dex. About 60 per cent of the total stellar mass was formed during this event. There are indications of intermediate-age star formation in KKR 25 between 1 and 4 Gyr with no significant signs of metal enrichment for these stars. Long-slit spectroscopy was carried out using the Russian 6-m telescope of the integrated starlight and bright individual objects in the galaxy. We have discovered a planetary nebula (PN) in KKR 25. This is the first known PN in a dSph galaxy outside the Local Group. We have measured its oxygen abundance 12 + log (O/H) = 7.60 {\textpm} 0.07 dex and a radial velocity Vh = -79 km s-1. We have analysed the stellar density distribution in the galaxy body. The galaxy has an exponential surface brightness profile with a central light depression. We discuss the evolutionary status of KKR 25, which belongs to a rare class of very isolated dwarf galaxies with spheroidal morphology.},

In the present contribution, we introduce the algorithm, lay out the ideas behind it, explain the methodology adopted to detect streams, and detail its workings by running it on a suite of simulations of mock Galactic survey data of similar quality to that expected from the European Space Agency/Gaia mission. We show that our algorithm is able to detect even ultra-faint stream features lying well below previous detection limits.

We show that luminosity and distance distributions of the model satellites are consistent with the distributions measured in the DES, PS1, and SDSS surveys, even without including a model for the orphan galaxies. We also show that our model for dwarf galaxy sizes can simultaneously reproduce the observed distribution of stellar half-mass radii, r1/2, of the MW satellites and the overall r1/2-M{$\star$} relation exhibited by observed dwarf galaxies. The model predicts that some of the observed faint stellar systems with r1/2 {$<$} 10 pc are ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Scaling of the stellar mass M{$\star$} and peak halo mass Mpeak for the model satellites is not described by a power law, but has a clear flattening of M{$\star$}-Mpeak scaling at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\} 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ imprinted by reionization. As a result, the fraction of low mass haloes (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\} 10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) hosting galaxies with MV {$<$} 0 is predicted to be 50 per cent at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}{\textbackslash}sim 3.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$. We find that such high fraction at that halo mass helps to reproduce the number of dwarf galaxies discovered recently in the HSC-SSP survey.

Upon completion, the SAGA Survey will spectroscopically identify satellite galaxies brighter than Mr,o = -12.3 around 100 Milky Way (MW) analogs at z {$\sim$} 0.01. In Stage II, we have more than quadrupled the sample size of Stage I, delivering results from 127 satellites around 36 MW analogs with an improved target selection strategy and deep photometric imaging catalogs from the Dark Energy Survey and the Legacy Surveys. We have obtained 25,372 galaxy redshifts, peaking around z = 0.2. These data significantly increase spectroscopic coverage for very low redshift objects in 17 {$<$} ro {$<$} 20.75 around SAGA hosts, creating a unique data set that places the Local Group in a wider context. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to nine and correlates with host galaxy and brightest satellite luminosities. We find that the number and luminosities of MW satellites are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying distribution as SAGA systems. The majority of confirmed SAGA satellites are star-forming, and the quenched fraction increases as satellite stellar mass and projected radius from the host galaxy decrease. Overall, the satellite quenched fraction among SAGA systems is lower than that in the Local Group. We compare the luminosity functions and radial distributions of SAGA satellites with theoretical predictions based on cold dark matter simulations and an empirical galaxy-halo connection model and find that the results are broadly in agreement.},

We show that this correlation can be entirely reproduced by fitting empirical relations in the central surface brightness versus absolute magnitude and S{\'e}rsic index versus absolute magnitude parameter spaces, and by assuming the existence of two types of outer halo GCs: one of high surface brightness (HSB group), with properties similar to those of inner halo clusters; and another of low surface brightness (LSB group), which share characteristics with dwarf spheroidal and UFD galaxies. Given the similarities of LSB clusters with dwarf spheroidal and UFD galaxies, we discuss the possibility that outer halo clusters also originated inside dark matter halos and that tidal forces from different host galaxy potentials are responsible for the different properties between HSB and LSB clusters.},

  abstract = {Enshrouded in several well-known controversies, dwarf galaxies have been extensively studied to learn about the underlying cosmology, notwithstanding that physical processes regulating their properties are poorly understood. To shed light on these processes, we introduce the Pandora suite of 17 high-resolution (3.5 parsec half-cell side) dwarf galaxy formation cosmological simulations. Commencing with magneto-thermo-turbulent star formation and mechanical supernova (SN) feedback, we gradually increase the complexity of physics incorporated, ultimately leading to our full-physics models combining magnetism, on-the-fly radiative transfer and the corresponding stellar photoheating, and SN-accelerated cosmic rays. We investigate multiple combinations of these processes, comparing them with observations to constrain what are the main mechanisms determining dwarf galaxy properties. We find hydrodynamical 'SN feedback-only' simulations struggle to produce realistic dwarf galaxies, leading either to overquenched or too centrally concentrated, dispersion-dominated systems when compared to observed field dwarfs. Accounting for radiation with cosmic rays results in extended and rotationally supported systems. Spatially 'distributed' feedback leads to realistic stellar and H I masses, galaxy sizes, and integrated kinematics. Furthermore, resolved kinematic maps of our full-physics models predict kinematically distinct clumps and kinematic misalignments of stars, H I, and H II after star formation events. Episodic star formation combined with its associated feedback induces more core-like dark matter central profiles, which our 'SN feedback-only' models struggle to achieve. Our results demonstrate the complexity of physical processes required to capture realistic dwarf galaxy properties, making tangible predictions for integral field unit surveys, radio synchrotron emission, and for galaxy and multiphase interstellar medium properties that JWST will probe.},

  abstract = {We derive the structural parameters of the recently discovered very low luminosity Milky Way satellites through a maximum likelihood algorithm applied to SDSS data. For each satellite, even when only a few tens of stars are available down to the SDSS flux limit, the algorithm yields robust estimates and errors for the centroid, position angle, ellipticity, exponential half-light radius and number of member stars (within the SDSS). This latter parameter is then used in conjunction with stellar population models of the satellites to derive their absolute magnitudes and stellar masses, accounting for color-magnitude diagram shot noise. Most parameters are in good agreement with previous determinations, but we now properly account for parameter covariances. However, we find that faint satellites are somewhat more elliptical than initially thought, and ascribe this effect to the previous use of smoothed maps, which can be dominated by the smoothing (round) kernel. As a result, the faintest half of the Milky Way dwarf galaxies (MV gtrsim -7.5) is significantly (4 {$\sigma$}) flatter (langepsilonrang = 0.47 +/- 0.03) than its brightest half (MVlesssim - 7.5, langepsilonrang = 0.32 +/- 0.02). From our best models, we also investigate whether the seemingly distorted shape of the satellites, often taken to be a sign of tidal distortion, can be quantified. We find that, except for tentative evidence of distortion in Canes Venatici I and Ursa Major II, these can be completely accounted for by Poisson scatter in the sparsely sampled systems. We consider three scenarios that could explain the rather elongated shape of faint satellites: rotation supported systems, stars following the shape of more triaxial dark matter subhalos, or elongation due to tidal interaction with the Milky Way. Although none of these is entirely satisfactory, the last one appears the least problematic, but obviously warrants much deeper observations to track evidence of such tidal interaction.},

The V-band surface brightness for this possible tidal extension ranges from 29.8 to 31.5 mag arcsec-2. The area covered in our survey ({\textasciitilde}1.65 deg2) is not enough to discriminate if this extratidal population is part of a tidal tail or an extended halo around the galaxy. The existence of this tidal extension in Ursa Minor indicates that this satellite is currently undergoing a tidal disruption process by the Milky Way.

  abstract = {We present a kinematic study of six dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) satellites of the Milky Way (MW), namely Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor. We combine proper motions (PMs) from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and line-of-sight velocities (vlos) from the literature to derive their 3D internal kinematics and to study the presence of internal velocity gradients. We find velocity gradients along the line-of-sight for Carina, Draco, Fornax, and Ursa Minor, at {$\geq$}1{$\sigma$} level of significance. The value of such gradients appears to be related to the orbital history of the dwarfs, indicating that the interaction with the MW is causing them. Dwarfs that are close to the MW and moving towards their orbits pericentres show, on average, larger velocity gradients. On the other hand, dwarfs that have recently left their orbits pericentres show no significant gradients. Lastly, dwarfs located at large Galactocentric distances show gradients with an intermediate intensity. Our results would indicate that the torque caused by the strong tidal forces exerted by the MW induces a strong velocity gradient when the dwarfs approach their orbits pericentres. During the pericentre passage, the rapid change in the forces direction would disrupt such gradient, which may steadily recover as the galaxies recede. We assess our findings by analysing dwarfs satellites from the TNG50 simulation. We find a significant increase in the intensity of the detected gradients as the satellites approach their pericentre, followed by a sharp drop as they abandon it, supporting our results for the dSphs of the MW.},

The RRLs display a spread in V-magnitude ({$\sim$}0.35 mag) which appears larger than photometric errors and the horizontal branch (HB) luminosity evolution of a mono-metallic population. Using several calibrations of two different reddening free and metal independent period-Wesenheit relations we provide a new distance estimate {$\mu$} = 19.62 mag ({$\sigma\mu$} = 0.04 mag) that agrees well with literature estimates. We constrained the metallicity distribution of the old population, using the MI period-luminosity relation, and we found that it ranges from -2.3 to -1.5 dex. The current estimate is narrower than suggested by low and intermediate spectroscopy of RGBs ({$\Delta$} [Fe/H]{$\leq$} 1.5). We also investigated the HB morphology as a function of the galactocentric distance. The HB in the innermost regions is dominated by red HB stars and by RRLs, consistent with a more metal-rich population, while in the outermost regions it is dominated by blue HB stars and RRLs typical of a metal-poor population. Our results suggest that fast chemical evolution occurred in Sculptor, and that the radial gradients were in place at an early epoch.},

After expelling the leftover gas, the stellar system undergoes a dynamical relaxation inside the dark matter halo. These models can adequately describe the observed properties of three (Draco, Sculptor, and Carina) out of four Galactic dwarf spheroidal satellites studied in this paper. We suggest that the fourth galaxy (Fornax), which cannot be fitted well with our model, is observed all the way to its tidal radius. Our best-fitting models have virial masses of {\textasciitilde}109 Msolar, halo formation redshifts consistent with the age of oldest stars in these dwarfs, and shallow inner dark matter density profiles (with slope {$\gamma$}{\textasciitilde}-0.5,...,0). The inferred temperature of gas is {\textasciitilde}104 K. In our model, the ``extratidal'' stars observed in the vicinity of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies are gravitationally bound to the galaxies and are a part of the extended stellar halos. The inferred virial masses make Galactic dwarf spheroidals massive enough to alleviate the ``missing satellites'' problem of {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmologies.},

Even for the dwarf galaxy Sculptor---one of the best-studied systems, which is inferred to be strongly dark matter dominated3,4---there are conflicting reports5-7 on its mean motion around the Milky Way, and the three-dimensional internal motions of its stars have never been measured. Here, we present precise proper motions of Sculptor's stars based on data from the Gaia mission8 and Hubble Space Telescope. Our measurements show that Sculptor moves around the Milky Way on a high-inclination elongated orbit that takes it much further out than previously thought. For Sculptor's internal velocity dispersions, we find {$\sigma$}R = 11.5 {\textpm} 4.3 km s-1 and {$\sigma$}T = 8.5 {\textpm} 3.2 km s-1 along the projected radial and tangential directions. Thus, the stars in our sample move preferentially on radial orbits as quantified by the anisotropy parameter, which we find to be {$\beta$} 0.8 6-0.83+0.12 at a location beyond the core radius. Taken at face value, this high radial anisotropy requires abandoning conventional models9 for Sculptor's mass distribution. Our sample is dominated by metal-rich stars and for these we find {$\beta$}M R 0.9 5-0.27+0.04---a value consistent with multi-component spherical models where Sculptor is embedded in a cuspy dark halo10, as might be expected for cold dark matter.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for the formation of stellar halos in dwarf galaxies. We demonstrate that the stars and star clusters that form naturally in the inner regions of dwarfs are expected to migrate from the gas-rich, star-forming center to join the stellar spheroid. For dwarf galaxies, this process could be the dominant source of halo stars. The effect is caused by stellar-feedback-driven bulk motions of dense gas which, by causing potential fluctuations in the inner regions of the halo, couple to all collisionless components. This effect has been demonstrated to generate cores in otherwise cuspy cold dark matter profiles and is particularly effective in dwarf galaxy halos. It can build a stellar spheroid with larger ages and lower metallicities at greater radii without requiring an outside-in formation model. Globular-cluster-type star clusters can be created in the galactic ISM and then migrate to the spheroid on 100 Myr timescales. Once outside the inner regions, they are less susceptible to tidal disruption and are thus long lived; clusters on wider orbits may be easily unbound from the dwarf to join the halo of a larger galaxy during a merger. A simulated dwarf galaxy (Mvir {$\simeq$} 109 M{$\Sun$} at z = 5) is used to examine this gravitational coupling to dark matter and stars.},

  abstract = {We present results from high-resolution N-body/SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamic) simulations of rotationally supported dwarf irregular galaxies moving on bound orbits in the massive dark matter halo of the Milky Way. The dwarf models span a range in disk surface density and the masses and sizes of their dark halos are consistent with the predictions of cold dark matter cosmogonies. We show that the strong tidal field of the Milky Way determines severe mass loss in their halos and disks and induces bar and bending instabilities that transform low surface brightness dwarfs (LSBs) into dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and high surface brightness dwarfs (HSBs) into dwarf ellipticals (dEs) in less than 10 Gyr. The final central velocity dispersions of the remnants are in the range 8-30 km s-1 and their final v/{$\sigma$} falls to values less than 0.5, matching well the kinematics of early-type dwarfs. The transformation requires the orbital time of the dwarf to be {$<$}{\textasciitilde}3-4 Gyr, which implies a halo as massive and extended as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation to explain the origin of even the farthest dSph satellites of the Milky Way, Leo I, and Leo II. We show that only dwarfs with central dark matter densities as high as those of Draco and Ursa Minor can survive for 10 Gyr in the proximity of the Milky Way. A correlation between the central density and the distance of the dwarfs from the primary galaxy is indeed expected in hierarchical models, in which the densest objects should have small orbital times because of their early formation epochs. Part of the gas is stripped and part is funneled to the center because of the bar, generating one strong burst of star formation in HSBs and smaller, multiple bursts in LSBs. Therefore, the large variety of star formation histories observed in Local Group dSphs arises because different types of dIrr progenitors respond differently to the external perturbation of the Milky Way. Our evolutionary model naturally explains the morphology-density relation observed in the Local Group and in other nearby loose groups. Extended low surface brightness stellar and gaseous streams originate from LSBs and follow the orbit of the dwarfs for several gigayears. Because of their high velocities, unbound stars projected along the line of sight can lead to overestimating the mass-to-light ratio of the bound remnant by a factor {$<$}{\textasciitilde}2, but this does not eliminate the need of extremely high dark matter contents in some of the dSphs.},

We propose a new dynamical mechanism driving the evolution of gas-rich, rotationally supported dIrr's, mostly found at the outskirts of the Local Group (LG), into gas-free, pressure-supported dwarf spheroidals (dSph's) or dwarf ellipticals (dE's), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals. The initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive dark matter halos and reproduce nearby dIrr's. Repeated tidal shocks at the pericenters of their orbits partially strip their halos and disks and trigger dynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar components. After only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness dIrr's are transformed into dSp'hs while high surface brightness dIrr's evolve into dE's. This evolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relation observed for LG dwarfs. Dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, such as the dIrr GR8, are turned into Draco or Ursa Minor, the faintest and most dark matter dominated among LG dSph's. If disks include a gaseous component, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts of star formation. The resulting star formation histories are in good qualitative agreement with those derived using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) color-magnitude diagrams for local dSph's.},

We have run high-resolution N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within the Milky Way halo to determine if such observations can be explained with dark matter potentials like those implied by current structure formation models. We show that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or with cuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter c{$<$}{\textasciitilde} 7) lead to flat outer stellar density profiles like that of Carina for a variety of orbital configurations. On the contrary, it is more difficult to remove stars from cuspy dark matter haloes with concentrations as high as predicted by cold dark matter (CDM) models at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies (c {$>$} 10), and the data can only be reproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. Our simulations show that Carina is losing mass at a fractional rate {$<$}0.1 Gyr-1 and its mass-to-light ratio could be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected along the line of sight. We follow the evolution of the tidal debris within a triaxial clumpy cold dark matter Milky Way halo which causes differential precession and small-scale heating of the stellar streams. This renders them useless as a dynamical tracer of the Galactic potential in CDM cosmogonies. Models with warm dark matter (WDM) or collisional fluid dark matter (FDM) produce dwarf haloes with lower central densities than CDM and would be consistent with the observed tidal tails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current data on nearby dwarf spheroidals. Galactic haloes in models with FDM are expected to be smooth and spherical and would be favoured by the detection of cold coherent streams such as that associated with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal. In this respect the distribution of stellar streams on the plane of the sky can provide a novel test of the nature of the dark matter. On the other end, the streams could be similarly dispersed in lumpy CDM haloes and in smoother, triaxial WDM haloes.},

  abstract = {We present deep, subhorizontal-branch, multicolour photometry of the Andromeda II dwarf spheroidal (And II dSph) taken with the Subaru Suprime-Cam wide-field camera. We identify a red clump population in this galaxy, the first time this feature has been detected in an M31 dSph, which are normally characterized as having no significant intermediate-age populations. We construct radial profiles for the various stellar populations and show that the horizontal branch (HB) has a nearly constant density spatial distribution out to large radius, whereas the reddest red giant branch stars are centrally concentrated in an exponential profile. We argue that these populations trace two distinct structural components in And II, and show that this assumption provides a good match to the overall radial profile of this galaxy. The extended component dominates the stellar populations at large radius, whereas the exponential component dominates the inner few arcminutes. By examining colour-magnitude diagrams in these regions, we show that the two components have very different stellar populations; the exponential component has an average age of {\textasciitilde}7-10 Gyr, is relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1) but with a significant tail to low metallicities, and possesses a red clump. The extended component, on the other hand, is ancient ({\textasciitilde}13 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.5) with a narrower dispersion {$\sigma$}[Fe/H] {\textasciitilde}= 0.28, and has a well-developed blue HB. The extended component contains approximately three-quarters of the light of And II and its unusual density profile is unique in Local Group dwarf galaxies. This suggests that its formation and/or evolution may have been quite different from other dwarf galaxies. The obvious chemodynamical complexity of And II lends further support to the accumulating body of evidence which shows that the evolutionary histories of faint dSph galaxies can be every bit as complicated as their brighter and more massive counterparts.

  abstract = {The projected structures and integrated properties of the Andromeda I, II, III, V, VI, VII and Cetus dwarf spheroidal galaxies are analysed based upon resolved counts of red giant branch stars. The observations were taken as part of the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Survey of M31 and its environs. For each object, we have derived isopleth maps, surface brightness profiles, intensity-weighted centres, position angles, ellipticities, tidal radii, core radii, concentration parameters, exponential scalelengths, Plummer scalelengths, half-light radii, absolute magnitudes and central surface brightnesses. Our analysis probes into larger radius and fainter surface brightnesses than most previous studies, and as a result we find that the galaxies are generally larger and brighter than has previously been recognized. In particular, the luminosity of Andromeda V is found to be consistent with the higher metallicity value which has been derived for it. We find that exponential and Plummer profiles provide adequate fits to the surface brightness profiles, although the more general King models provide the best formal fits. Andromeda I shows strong evidence of tidal disruption and S-shaped tidal tails are clearly visible. On the other hand, Cetus does not show any evidence of tidal truncation, let alone disruption, which is perhaps unsurprising given its isolated location. Andromeda II shows compelling evidence of a large excess of stars at small radius and suggests that this galaxy consists of a secondary core component, in analogy with recent results for Sculptor and Sextans. Comparing the M31 dwarf spheroidal population with the Galactic population, we find that the scaleradii of the M31 population are larger than those for the Galactic population by at least a factor of 2, for all absolute magnitudes. This difference is either due to environmental factors or due to orbital properties, suggesting that the ensemble average tidal field experienced by the M31 dwarf spheroidals is weaker than that experienced by the Galactic dwarf spheroidals. We find that the two populations are offset from one another in the central surface brightness - luminosity relation, which is probably related to this difference in their scale sizes. Finally, we find that the M31 dwarf spheroidals show the same correlation with distance from host as shown by the Galactic population, such that dwarf spheroidals with a higher central surface brightness are found further from their host. This again suggests that environment plays a significant role in dwarf galaxy evolution, and requires detailed modelling to explain the origin of this result.},

  abstract = {The dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Local Group have long been thought to be simple spheroids of stars embedded within extended dark matter haloes. Recently, however, evidence for the presence of spatially and kinematically distinct stellar populations has been accumulating. Here, we examine the influence of such components on dynamical models of dwarf galaxies embedded in cold dark matter haloes. We begin by constructing a model of Andromeda II, a dSph satellite of M31 which shows evidence for spatially distinct stellar components. We find that the two-component model predicts an overall velocity dispersion profile that remains approximately constant at {\textasciitilde}10-11kms-1 out to {\textasciitilde}1 kpc from the centre; this is despite wide kinematic and spatial differences between the two individual components. This prediction can be validated by detailed spectroscopic analysis of this galaxy. The presence of two components may also help to explain oddities in the velocity dispersion profiles of other dSphs; we show that velocity dispersion profiles which appear to rise from the centre outwards before levelling off - such as those of Leo I, Draco, and Fornax - can result from the gradual transition from a dynamically cold, concentrated component to a second, hotter, and more spatially extended one, both in equilibrium within the same dark halo. Dwarf galaxies with two stellar components generally have a leptokurtic line-of-sight velocity distribution which is well described by a double Maxwellian. This may be contrasted with other dynamical explanations such as a radially dependent anisotropy in the stars' orbits. Interestingly, we find that multiple equilibrium components could also provide a potential alternative origin for `extra-tidal' stars (normally ascribed to tidal effects) in situations where corroborating evidence for tides - such as elongation of the main body of the dwarf in the orbital direction or velocity gradients across its face driven by protruding tidal tails - may be lacking.},

  abstract = {Positional, structural, and dynamical parameters for all dwarf galaxies in and around the Local Group are presented, and various aspects of our observational understanding of this volume-limited sample are discussed. Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates reliably placing them within 3 Mpc of the Sun are identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible "floor" in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered.},

We examine recent data for these objects in the plane of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR). While some dwarf spheroidals adhere to the BTFR, others deviate substantially. We examine the residuals from the BTFR and find that they are not random. The residuals correlate with luminosity, size, metallicity, ellipticity, and susceptibility of the dwarfs to tidal disruption in the sense that fainter, more elliptical, and tidally more susceptible dwarfs deviate farther from the BTFR. These correlations disfavor stochastic processes and suggest a role for tidal effects. We identify a test to distinguish between {$\Lambda$}CDM and MOND based on the orbits of the dwarf satellites of the Milky Way and how stars are lost from them.},

The method used to create these models is that demonstrated in our previous study, and we improve on those models by adding gas discs to the potential, considering the effects of allowing the inner slope of the halo density profile to vary, and including new observations of maser sources in the Milky Way amongst the new constraints. We provide a best-fitting model, as well as estimates of the properties of the Milky Way. Under the assumptions in our main model, we find that the Sun is R0 = 8.20 {\textpm} 0.09 kpc from the Galactic Centre, with the circular speed at the Sun being v0 = 232.8 {\textpm} 3.0 km s-1; and that the Galaxy has a total stellar mass of (54.3 {\textpm} 5.7) {\texttimes} 109 M{$\odot$}, a total virial mass of (1.30 {\textpm} 0.30) {\texttimes} 1012 M{$\odot$} and a local dark-matter density of 0.40 {\textpm} 0.04 GeV cm-3, where the quoted uncertainties are statistical. These values are sensitive to our choice of priors and constraints. We investigate systematic uncertainties, which in some cases may be larger. For example, if we weaken our prior on R0, we find it to be 7.97 {\textpm} 0.15 kpc and that v0 = 226.8 {\textpm} 4.2 km s-1. We find that most of these properties, including the local dark-matter density, are remarkably insensitive to the assumed power-law density slope at the centre of the dark-matter halo. We find that it is unlikely that the local standard of rest differs significantly from that found under assumptions of axisymmetry.

  abstract = {We present the catalog of RR Lyrae stars observed in the first year of operations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. This catalog contains 6,240 RR Lyrae stars out to \${\textbackslash}sim100\${\textbackslash},kpc from the Galactic center and over 12,000 individual epochs with homogeneously-derived stellar atmospheric parameters. We introduce a novel methodology to model the cyclical variation of the spectroscopic properties of RR Lyrae from single-epoch measurements. We employ this method to infer the radial velocity and effective temperature variation of fundamental mode and first-overtone RR Lyrae stars and to determine their systemic velocities and mean temperatures. For fundamental mode pulsators, we obtain radial velocity curves with amplitudes of \${\textbackslash}sim\$30--50{\textbackslash},km{\textbackslash},s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and effective temperature curves with 300--1,000{\textbackslash},K variations, whereas for first-overtone pulsators these amplitudes are \${\textbackslash}sim20\${\textbackslash},km{\textbackslash},s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 600\${\textbackslash},K, respectively. We use our sample to study the metallicity distribution of the halo and its dependence on Galactocentric distance (\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm GC\}\$). Using a radius-dependent mixture model, we split the data into chemodynamically distinct components and find that our inner halo sample (\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm GC\}{\textbackslash}lesssim50\${\textbackslash},kpc) is predominantly composed of stars with [Fe/H] \${\textbackslash}sim-1.5\${\textbackslash},dex and largely radial orbits (with an anisotropy parameter \${$\beta\backslash$}sim0.94\$), that we associate with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger event. Stars in the outer halo field exhibit a broader and more metal-poor [Fe/H] distribution with more circular orbits (\${$\beta\backslash$}sim0.39\$). The metallicity gradient of the metal-rich and the metal-poor components is found to be \$0.005\$ and \$0.010\${\textbackslash},dex{\textbackslash},kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, respectively. Our catalog highlights DESI's tantalizing potential for studying the Milky Way and the pulsation properties of RR Lyrae stars in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.},

Using a sample 6,240 RRLs obtained in the first year of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we investigate the metallicity of RRLs and its correlation with their pulsation properties. We find that (1) a clear correlation between period and [Fe/H] reinforces the view that the longstanding Oosterhoff dichotomy arises from the scarcity of intermediate-metallicity Galactic globular clusters hosting sizeable RRL samples; (2) high-amplitude short-period and small-amplitude short-period variables are comparatively metal-rich, with mean [Fe/H] = \$-1.39 {\textbackslash}pm 0.27\$ and \$-1.30 {\textbackslash}pm 0.28\$, respectively; (3) in double-mode pulsators (RRd) the metallicity declines smoothly with increasing fundamental-mode period, and anomalous RRd stars occupy a remarkably narrow [Fe/H] range relative to classical RRd stars; (4) this spectroscopic sample let us, for the first time, place empirical constraints on the metallicity-dependent topology of the instability strip using phase-corrected effective temperatures and a large number of RRLs, where we observe an instability strip that moves towards cooler Teff with declining [Fe/H] with a width consistent with stellar-evolution models; and (5) a subset of metal-rich RRLs exhibits orbits consistent with disk membership and halo kinematics. Our results confirm the tantalizing potential of DESI for Galactic and stellar astrophysics and highlight the importance of the even larger samples of RRLs and data-processing improvements forthcoming in future DESI data releases.},

This data set includes {$\sim$}2.5 million exposures in each of W1 and W2, effectively doubling the amount of WISE imaging available at 3.4 {$\mu$}m and 4.6 {$\mu$}m relative to the AllWISE release. We have created the first ever full-sky set of coadds combining all publicly available W1 and W2 exposures from both the AllWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation (NEOWISER) mission phases. We employ an adaptation of the unWISE image coaddition framework, which preserves the native WISE angular resolution and is optimized for forced photometry. By incorporating two additional scans of the entire sky, we not only improve the W1/W2 depths, but also largely eliminate time-dependent artifacts such as off-axis scattered moonlight. We anticipate that our new coadds will have a broad range of applications, including target selection for upcoming spectroscopic cosmology surveys, identification of distant/massive galaxy clusters, and discovery of high-redshift quasars. In particular, our full-depth AllWISE+NEOWISER coadds will be an important input for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument selection of luminous red galaxy and quasar targets. Our full-depth W1/W2 coadds are already in use within the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) reduction pipelines. Much more work still remains in order to fully leverage NEOWISER imaging for astrophysical applications beyond the solar system.},

We use FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of 26 isolated galaxies as well as existing observational data for 10 Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our simulated galaxies have stellar masses between 105.5 and 108.6 M{$\odot$}. Whilst gas-phase metallicty gradients are generally weak in our simulated galaxies, we find that stellar metallicity gradients are common, with central regions tending to be more metal-rich than the outer parts. The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients. Stellar metallicty gradients are set by two competing processes: (1) the steady 'puffing' of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations and (2) the accretion of extended, metal-rich gas at late times, which fuels late-time metal-rich star formation. If recent star formation dominates, then extended, metal-rich star formation washes out pre-existing gradients from the 'puffing' process. We use published results from ten Local Group dwarf galaxies to show that a similar relationship between age and stellar metallicity-gradient strength exists among real dwarfs. This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects.},

The difference between the two cloud density laws is slight, and it is probable that any nearly uniform sphere in uniform rotation can generate (with the same angular momentum constraint) two disks, with rotation laws that approximate respectively to = constant and V constant. The two models are regarded as smoothed-out, zero-order approximations to the barred and the normal spirals: which disk is formed from the collapsing primeval sphere depends on the relative strengths of the perturbations present.},

We find that these satellites may deposit a significant fraction of their stars into the disc components of a galaxy, and use our results to motivate the search for accretion relics in samples of metal-poor disc stars in the vicinity of the Sun. Satellites disrupted on very eccentric orbits coplanar with the disc are expected to shed stars in `trails' of distinct orbital energy and angular momentum during each pericentric passage. To an observer located between the pericentre and apocentre of such orbits, these trails would show as distinct groupings of stars with low vertical velocity and a broad, symmetric, often double-peaked distribution of Galactocentric radial velocities. One group of stars with these characteristics stands out in available compilations of nearby metal-poor stars. These stars have specific angular momenta similar to that of the globular cluster {$\omega$}Cen, long hypothesized to be the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy disrupted by the Milky Way tidal field. In addition to their kindred kinematics, stars in the {$\omega$}Cen group share distinct chemical abundance characteristics, and trace a well-defined track in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plane, consistent with simple closed-box enrichment models and a protracted star formation history. The dynamical and chemical coherence of this group suggests that it consists of stars that once belonged to the dwarf that brought {$\omega$}Cen into the Galaxy. The presence of this and other `tidal relics' in the solar neighbourhood suggest an extra-Galactic origin for the presence of nearby stars with odd kinematics and chemistry, and implies that accounting for stars contributed by distinct satellite galaxies may be crucial to the success of models of Galactic chemical enrichment.},

  abstract = {Gerhard has recently analyzed the data on seven dwarf spheroidal galaxies and concluded that these disagree with the predictions of MOND. We contend that this conclusion was premature; with new data for three of the dwarf galaxies, the observations of all dwarfs are in compelling agreement with the predictions of MOND. In most cases, Gerhard found MOND M/L values that fall around a few solar units, as expected if MOND is a valid alternative to dark matter while the Newtonian M/L values are in the range of about 10 to 100 solar units. However, some of Gerhard's MOND M/L values were still outside the range of "reasonable" stellar values, say between 1 and 3 (two were too high about 1(\#and one too low). This, we say, was easily attributable to uncertainties in the data and in the assumptions that underlie the analysis. There are now new, much improved determinations of the velocity dispersions for three of the dwarfs, in particular for the two dwarfs for which Gerhard found high MOND M/L values: the preliminary, high value for Leo II has been superseded by a much smaller value (by a factor of 2) that gives a MOND M/L value of about 1.5 (instead of about 9). There is also a new determination of the velocity dispersion of Ursa Minor that brings down the MOND M/L value considerably. The one small MOND M/L value that Gerhard found is also shown to be quite benign. In fact, within just the quoted errors on the velocity dispersions and the luminosities, the MOND M/L values for all seven dwarfs are perfectly consistent with stellar values, with no need for dark matter.},

  abstract = {We investigate dynamical self-friction, the process by which material that is stripped from a subhalo torques its remaining bound remnant, which causes it to lose orbital angular momentum. By running idealized simulations of a subhalo orbiting within an analytical host halo potential, we isolate the effect of self-friction from traditional dynamical friction due to the host halo. While at some points in a subhalo's orbit the torque of the stripped material can boost the orbital angular momentum of the remnant, the net effect over the long term is orbital decay regardless of the initial orbital parameters or subhalo mass. In order to quantify the strength of self-friction, we run a suite of simulations spanning typical host-to-subhalo mass ratios and orbital parameters. We find that the time-scale for self-friction, defined as the exponential decay time of the subhalo's orbital angular momentum, scales with mass ratio and orbital circularity similar to standard dynamical friction. The decay time due to self-friction is roughly an order of magnitude longer, suggesting that self-friction only contributes at the 10 per cent level. However, along more radial orbits, self-friction can occasionally dominate over dynamical friction close to pericentric passage, where mass stripping is intense. This is also the epoch at which the self-friction torque undergoes large and rapid changes in both magnitude and direction, indicating that self-friction is an important process to consider when modelling pericentric passages of subhaloes and their associated satellite galaxies.},

The halo consists of Population II stars, with low metallicities and age {$>$}=1010 yr. The finding of a halo in a dwarf irregular galaxy argues for a generic mode of galaxy formation that requires a halo in the presence of a disk, regardless of galaxy size. This implies that formation mechanisms are similar along the spiral Hubble sequence, and favors the scenarios where the formation takes place during the original collapse and accretion of the protogalactic gas clouds. Halo formation also appears not necessarily to be related to the presence of a bulge, or a nucleus, since WLM lacks both of these components.},

  abstract = {Recent measurements of the proper motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) show it to be moving in a nearly circular orbit around the Milky Way, and to be leading the Magellanic Stream which stretches in a well- confined arc 100{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} behind it. We present numerical investigations designed to test models of the origin of the Magellanic Stream critically. The most developed model is the tidal model, but this fails to reproduce several characteristic properties of the Stream. (i) High- resolution numerical simulations of tidal stripping show that material stripped from the LMC would retain the internal velocities of the LMC and would define a thick plane surrounding the Milky Way, not the tightly confined wake actually observed. (ii) There is no leading stream as would be expected if it were tidally produced. (iii) The observed radial velocity along the Stream is inconsistent with the observed orbital parameters of the Magellanic Clouds. (iv) The uniform variation in column density along the Stream cannot be reproduced by tidal forces. (v) No stars have been observed within the Stream, but stars should be tidally stripped from the LMC as easily as gas. Recent refinements to the tidal model (Gardiner et al.; Lin et al.) address some, but not all, of these problems. We suggest an alternative model for the origin of the Magellanic Stream which can explain all of its observed features and dynamics, as well as provide a strong constraint on the distribution of gas within the halo of the Milky Way. We propose that the Stream consists of material that was ram-pressure-stripped from the Magellanic System during its last passage through an extended ionized disc of the Galaxy. This collision took place some 500 million years ago at a galactocentric distance of about 65 kpc, and swept {\textasciitilde}20 per cent of the least-bound HI into the Stream. The gas with the lowest column density lost the most orbital angular momentum. At the present time this material is at the tip of the Stream and has fallen to a distance of {\textasciitilde}20 kpc from the Milky Way, attaining a negative velocity of 200 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. To prevent the stripped material from leading the Magellanic Clouds and attaining too large an infall velocity, we postulate the existence of an extended dilute halo of diffuse ionized gas surrounding the Milky Way. If the halo gas is at the virial temperature of the potential well of the Milky Way (2.2 x 10{\textasciicircum}6{\textasciicircum}K), its thermal emission would contribute {\textasciitilde}40 per cent of the observed diffuse background radiation in the 0.5-1.0 keV (M) band, and this is consistent with recent ROSAT measurements as well as pulsar dispersion measures. Ram-pressure stripping from this extended disc and gaseous halo would explain the absence of gas in globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal companions to the Milky Way. Some fraction of the observed high-velocity clouds might be the infalling debris from previous orbits of the LMC through the extended disc.},

Several models have been proposed to provide the dark matter required within galaxy haloes for a flat universe, of which cold dark matter (CDM) has proved the most successful at reproducing the observed large-scale structure of the Universe4-6. CDM belongs to a class of non-relativistic particles that interact primarily through gravity, and are named dissipationless because they cannot dissipate energy (baryonic particles can lose energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation). Here I show that the modelled small-scale properties of CDM7-9 are fundamentally incompatible with recent observations10-13 of dwarf galaxies, which are thought to be completely dominated by dark matter on scales larger than a kiloparsec. Thus, the hypothesis that dark matter is predominantly cold seems hard to sustain.},

We do detect steepened (with respect to a standard Plummer model) outer profiles in several dSphs---Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, and Reticulum II---which may point to distinct evolutionary pathways for these objects.

  abstract = {We present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire cosmic history from z {$\sim$} 4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z =4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8 to 1012.5 M{$\odot$}. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites at z {$<$} 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

Using a maximum-likelihood technique we measure a half-light radius of 0farcm5, or equivalently 7 pc, and an ellipticity consistent with being zero.

This new satellite is separate from Ursa Minor by {\textasciitilde}30 kpc and 110 km s-1 suggesting the cluster is not obviously associated with the dSph, despite the very close angular separation. Based on its photometric properties and structural parameters we conclude that Mu{\~n}oz 1 is a new ultra-faint stellar cluster.

Our survey targets an unbiased sample of ``outer halo'' satellites (i.e., substructures having galactocentric distances greater than 25 kpc) and includes classical dSph galaxies, ultra-faint dwarfs, and remote globular clusters. We combine deep, panoramic gr imaging for 44 satellites and archival gr imaging for 14 additional objects (primarily obtained with the DECam instrument as part of the Dark Energy Survey) to measure photometric and structural parameters for 58 outer halo satellites. This is the largest and most uniform analysis of Milky Way satellites undertaken to date and represents roughly three-quarters (58/81 {$\simeq$} 72\%) of all known outer halo satellites. We use a maximum-likelihood method to fit four density laws to each object in our survey: exponential, Plummer, King, and S{\'e}rsic models. We systematically examine the isodensity contour maps and color-magnitude diagrams for each of our program objects, present a comparison with previous results, and tabulate our best-fit photometric and structural parameters, including ellipticities, position angles, effective radii, S{\'e}rsic indices, absolute magnitudes, and surface brightness measurements. We investigate the distribution of outer halo satellites in the size-magnitude diagram and show that the current sample of outer halo substructures spans a wide range in effective radius, luminosity, and surface brightness, with little evidence for a clean separation into star cluster and galaxy populations at the faintest luminosities and surface brightnesses.},

Our sample consists of 58 stellar overdensities---i.e., substructures classified as either globular clusters, classical dwarf galaxies, or ultra-faint dwarf galaxies---that are located at Galactocentric distances of R GC {$\geq$} 25 kpc (outer halo) and out to {$\sim$}400 kpc. This includes 44 objects for which we have acquired deep, wide-field, g- and r-band imaging with the MegaCam mosaic cameras on the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the 6.5 m Magellan-Clay telescope. These data are supplemented by archival imaging, or published gr photometry, for an additional 14 objects, most of which were discovered recently in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We describe the scientific motivation for our survey, including sample selection, observing strategy, data reduction pipeline, calibration procedures, and the depth and precision of the photometry. The typical 5{$\sigma$} point-source limiting magnitudes for our MegaCam imaging---which collectively covers an area of {$\approx$}52 deg2---are g lim {$\simeq$} 25.6 and r lim {$\simeq$} 25.3 AB mag. These limits are comparable to those from the coadded DES images and are roughly a half-magnitude deeper than will be reached in a single visit with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Our photometric catalog thus provides the deepest and most uniform photometric database of Milky Way satellites available for the foreseeable future. In other papers in this series, we have used these data to explore the blue straggler populations in these objects, their density distributions, star formation histories, scaling relations, and possible foreground structures.},

  abstract = {We report the results of N-body simulations of disrupting satellites aimed at exploring whether the observed features of dSphs can be accounted for with simple, mass-follows-light (MFL) models including tidal disruption. As a test case, we focus on the Carina dwarf spheroidal (dSph), which presently is the dSph system with the most extensive data at large radius. We find that previous N-body, MFL simulations of dSphs did not sufficiently explore the parameter space of satellite mass, density, and orbital shape to find adequate matches to Galactic dSph systems, whereas with a systematic survey of parameter space we are able to find tidally disrupting, MFL satellite models that rather faithfully reproduce Carina's velocity profile, velocity dispersion profile, and projected density distribution over its entire sampled radius. The successful MFL model satellites have very eccentric orbits, currently favored by CDM models, and central velocity dispersions that still yield an accurate representation of the bound mass and observed central M/L {\textasciitilde} 40 of Carina, despite inflation of the velocity dispersion outside the dSph core by unbound debris. Our survey of parameter space also allows us to address a number of commonly held misperceptions of tidal disruption and its observable effects on dSph structure and dynamics. The simulations suggest that even modest tidal disruption can have a profound effect on the observed dynamics of dSph stars at large radii. Satellites that are well described by tidally disrupting MFL models could still be fully compatible with {$\Lambda$}CDM if, for example, they represent a later stage in the evolution of luminous subhalos.},

Our simulated dwarfs have stellar masses of M star = 790 M {$\odot$} to 8.2 {\texttimes} 108 M {$\odot$}, with corresponding V-band magnitudes from -2 to -18.5. For M peak {$>$} 1010 M {$\odot$}, the simulated SMHM relationship agrees with literature determinations, including exhibiting a small scatter of 0.3 dex. However, the scatter in the SMHM relation increases for lower-mass halos. We first present results for well-resolved halos that contain a simulated stellar population, but recognize that whether a halo hosts a galaxy is inherently mass resolution dependent. We thus adopt a probabilistic model to populate "dark" halos below our resolution limit to predict an "intrinsic" slope and scatter for the SMHM relation. We fit linearly growing log-normal scatter in stellar mass, which grows to more than 1 dex at M peak = 108 M {$\odot$}. At the faintest end of the SMHM relation probed by our simulations, a galaxy cannot be assigned a unique halo mass based solely on its luminosity. Instead, we provide a formula to stochastically populate low-mass halos following our results. Finally, we show that our growing log-normal scatter steepens the faint-end slope of the predicted stellar mass function.},

This constitutes all known Milky Way dwarf galaxies (and likely candidates) as of 2020 May, except for the Magellanic Clouds, the Canis Major and Hydra 1 stellar overdensities, and the tidally disrupting Bootes III and Sagittarius dwarf galaxies. We derive systemic proper motions for the first time for Indus 1, DES J0225+0304, Cetus 2, Pictor 2, and Leo T, but note that the latter three rely on photometry that is of poorer quality than that of the rest of the sample. We cannot resolve a signal for Bootes 4, Cetus 3, Indus 2, Pegasus 3, or Virgo 1. Our method is inspired by the maximum likelihood approach of Pace \& Li and examines simultaneously the spatial, color-magnitude, and proper motion distribution of sources. Systemic proper motions are derived without the need to identify confirmed radial velocity members, although the proper motions of these stars, where available, are incorporated into the analysis through a prior on the model. The associated uncertainties on the systemic proper motions are on average a factor of {$\sim$}1.4 smaller than existing literature values. Analysis of the implied membership distribution of the satellites suggests that we accurately identify member stars with a contamination rate lower than 1 in 20.},

  abstract = {We study the mass, velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) haloes using a suite of N-body simulations of unprecedented numerical resolution. The Aquarius Project follows the formation of six different galaxy-sized haloes simulated several times at varying numerical resolution, allowing numerical convergence to be assessed directly. The highest resolution simulation represents a single dark matter halo using 4.4 billion particles, of which 1.1 billion end up within the virial radius. Our analysis confirms a number of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues where conflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. The mass profile of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes deviates slightly but systematically from the form proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White. The spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwards and, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is {$\gamma$} {$\equiv$} - d ln {$\rho$}/d ln r {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 1. Asymptotic inner slopes as steep as the recently claimed {$\rho$} {\textasciitilde} r-1.2 are clearly ruled out. The radial dependence of {$\gamma$} is well approximated by a power law, {$\gamma$} {\textasciitilde} r{$\alpha$} (the Einasto profile). The shape parameter, {$\alpha$}, varies slightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profiles of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes are not strictly universal: different haloes cannot, in general, be rescaled to look identical. Departures from similarity are also seen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in density profiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averaged pseudo-phase-space density, {$\rho$}/{$\sigma$}3 {\textasciitilde} r-1.875. The index here is identical to that of Bertschinger's similarity solution for self-similar infall on to a point mass from an otherwise uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe. The origin of this striking behaviour is unclear, but its robustness suggests that it reflects a fundamental structural property of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes. Our conclusions are reliable down to radii below 0.4 per cent of the virial radius, providing well-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects are neglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which the modifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can be judged.},

We show that this sudden loss of mass leads to the formation of a core in the dark matter density profile, although the original halo is modelled by a coreless (Hernquist) profile. The core radius thus created is a sensitive function of the mass and radius of the baryonic disc being blown up. The loss of a disc with mass and size consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis constraints and angular momentum considerations imprints a core radius that is only a small fraction of the original scalelength of the halo. These small perturbations are, however, enough to reconcile the rotation curves of dwarf irregulars with the density profiles of haloes formed in the standard CDM scenario.},

  abstract = {We construct the first comprehensive dynamical model for the high-quality subset of stellar kinematics of the Milky Way disc, with full 6D phase-space coordinates, provided by the Gaia Data Release 2. We adopt an axisymmetric approximation and use an updated Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which allows for a generic shape and radial orientation of the velocity ellipsoid, as indicated by the Gaia data, to fit the mean velocities and all three components of the intrinsic velocity dispersion tensor. The Milky Way is the first galaxy for which all intrinsic phase space coordinates are available, and the kinematics are superior to the best integral-field kinematics of external galaxies. This situation removes the long-standing dynamical degeneracies and makes this the first dynamical model highly overconstrained by the kinematics. For these reasons, our ability to fit the data provides a fundamental test for both galaxy dynamics and the mass distribution in the Milky Way disc. We tightly constrain the volume average total density logarithmic slope, in the radial range 3.6-12 kpc, to be {$\alpha$}tot = -2.149 {\textpm} 0.055 and find that the dark halo slope must be significantly steeper than {$\alpha$}DM = -1 (NFW). The dark halo shape is close to spherical and its density is {$\rho$}DM(R{$\odot$}) = 0.0115 {\textpm} 0.0020 M{$\odot$} pc-3 (0.437 {\textpm} 0.076 GeV cm-3), in agreement with previous estimates. The circular velocity at the solar position Vcirc(R{$\odot$}) = 236.5 {\textpm} 3.1 km s-1 (including systematics) and its gently declining radial trends are also consistent with recent determinations.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

The deep (g {$\sim$} 24) SMASH color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) clearly reveal old ({$\sim$}9 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] {$\approx$} -0.8 dex) main-sequence stars at a distance of {$\sim$}50 kpc. The surface brightness of these detections is extremely low with our most distant detection at {$\Sigma$} g {$\approx$} 34 mag arcsec-2. The SMASH radial density profile breaks from the inner LMC exponential decline at {$\sim$}13{$^\circ$}-15{$^\circ$} and a second component at larger radii has a shallower slope with power-law index {$\alpha$} = -2.2 that contributes {$\sim$}0.4\% of the LMC's total stellar mass. In addition, the SMASH densities exhibit large scatter around our best-fit model of {$\sim$}70\% indicating that the envelope of stellar material in the LMC periphery is highly disturbed. We also use data from the NOAO Source catalog to map the LMC main-sequence populations at intermediate radii and detect a steep dropoff in density on the eastern side of the LMC (at R {$\approx$} 8{$^\circ$}) as well as an extended structure to the far northeast. These combined results confirm the existence of a very extended, low-density envelope of stellar material with a disturbed shape around the LMC. The exact origin of this structure remains unclear, but the leading options include an accreted halo or tidally stripped outer disk material.},

We make use of the spherically aligned Jeans anisotropic method to model the stellar velocities and their velocity dispersions. Building upon our previous work, our model is now fitted to kinematic maps that have been extended to larger galactocentric radii due to the expansion of our data set, probing the outer regions of the Galactic disk. Our best-fitting dynamical model suggests a logarithmic density slope of {$\alpha$}DM = -1.602 {\textpm} 0.079syst for the dark matter halo and a dark matter density of {$\rho$}DM(R{$\odot$}) = (8.92 {\textpm} 0.56syst) {\texttimes} 10-3 M{$\odot$} pc-3 (0.339 {\textpm} 0.022syst GeV cm3).

While the statistical errors are small, the error budget of the derived quantities is dominated by the three to seven times larger systematic uncertainties. These values are consistent with our previous determination, but the systematic uncertainties are reduced due to the extended data set covering a larger spatial extent of the Milky Way disk. Furthermore, we test the influence of nonaxisymmetric features on our resulting model and analyze how a flaring disk model would change our findings.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed deep Near Infrared (NIR) broad band images for a sample of Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxies (BCDs), observed with the ESO NTT and Calar Alto 3.6 m telescopes. The data presented here allows for the detection and quantitative study of the extended stellar low-surface brightness (LSB) host galaxy in all sample BCDs. NIR surface brightness profiles (SBPs) of the LSB host galaxies agree at large galactocentric radii with those from optical studies, showing also an exponential intensity decrease and compatible scale lengths. At small to intermediate radii (within 1-3 exponential scale lengths), however, the NIR data reveals for more than one half of our sample BCDs evidence for a significant flattening of the exponential profile of the LSB component. Such profiles (type V SBPs, Binggeli \& Cameron {\textbackslash}cite\{binggeli91\}) have rarely been detected in the LSB component of BCDs at optical wavelengths, where the relative flux contribution of the starburst, being stronger than in the NIR, can readily hide a possible central intensity depression in the underlying LSB host. The structural properties, frequency and physical origin of type V LSB profiles in BCDs and dwarf galaxies in general have not yet been subject to systematic studies. Nevertheless, the occurrence of such profiles in an appreciable fraction of BCDs would impose important new observational constraints to the radial mass distribution of the stellar LSB component, as well as to the photometric fading of these systems after the termination of star-forming activities. We test the suitability of two empirical fitting functions, a modified exponential distribution (Papaderos et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{papaderos96a\}) and the S{\'e}rsic law, for the systematization of the structural properties of BCD host galaxies which show a type V intensity distribution. Either function has been found to satisfactorily fit a type V distribution. However, it is argued that the practical applicability of S{\'e}rsic fits to the LSB emission of BCDs is limited by the extreme sensitivity of the achieved solutions to, e.g., small uncertainties in the sky subtraction and SBP derivation. We find that most of the sample BCDs show in their stellar LSB host galaxy optical-NIR colors indicative of an evolved stellar population with subsolar metallicity. Unsharp-masked NIR maps reveal numerous morphological details and indicate in some cases, in combination with optical data, appreciable non-uniform dust absorption on a spatial scale as large as {\textasciitilde} 1 kpc.

We succeed in separating M31's halo stars from foreground contamination with 90 per cent accuracy by using the surface gravity sensitive NB515 filter. Based on the selected M31 halo stars, we discover three new substructures, which associate with the Giant Southern Stream (GSS) based on their photometric metallicity estimates. We also produce the distance and photometric metallicity estimates for the known substructures. While these quantities for the GSS are reproduced in our study, we find that the north-western stream shows a steeper distance gradient than found in an earlier study, suggesting that it is likely to have formed in an orbit closer to the Milky Way. For two streams in the eastern halo (Stream C and D), we identify distance gradients that had not been resolved. Finally, we investigate the global halo photometric metallicity distribution and surface brightness profile using the NB515-selected halo stars. We find that the surface brightness of the metal-poor and metal-rich halo populations, and the all population can be fitted to a power-law profile with an index of , , and , respectively. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo profile, its photometric metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with non-monotonic trends with radius, suggesting that the halo population had insufficient time to dynamically homogenize the accreted populations.},

  abstract = {The abundance and demographics of dark matter substructure are important for many areas in astrophysics and cosmological N-body simulations have been the primary tool used to investigate them. However, it has recently become clear that the simulations are subject to numerical artefacts, which hampers a proper treatment of the tidal evolution of subhaloes. Unfortunately, no analytical models that accurately describe subhalo evolution exist either. We therefore present a library of idealized, high-resolution N-body simulations of the tidal evolution of individual subhaloes that can be used to calibrate semi-analytical models and to complement cosmological simulations. The simulations focus on minor mergers, i.e. the mass of the subhalo is much smaller than that of the host halo, such that the impact of dynamical friction is negligible. This set-up allows the adoption of a fixed analytical potential for modelling the host halo. The dynamical evolution of subhaloes is followed with N-body computations. In the library, four parameters, two of which characterize the subhalo orbit with respect to the host halo, and the two concentrations of the host- and subhalo, are varied over the ranges encountered in cosmological simulations. We show several representative examples from the library that illustrate the evolution of the subhalo mass and velocity dispersion profiles. Additionally, we make a pre-trained non-parametric model of the subhalo mass evolution based on random forest regression publicly available. This model is able to interpolate the simulation data at the 0.1 dex level and provides efficient access to the data for further use in modelling.1},

  abstract = {We present high-resolution rotation curves and mass models of 26 dwarf galaxies from ``Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The H i Nearby Galaxy Survey'' (LITTLE THINGS). LITTLE THINGS is a high-resolution ({$\sim$}6{${''}$} angular; {$<$}2.6 km s-1 velocity resolution) Very Large Array H i survey for nearby dwarf galaxies in the local volume within 11 Mpc. The high-resolution H i observations enable us to derive reliable rotation curves of the sample galaxies in a homogeneous and consistent manner. The rotation curves are then combined with Spitzer archival 3.6 {$\mu$}m and ancillary optical U, B, and V images to construct mass models of the galaxies. This high quality multi-wavelength data set significantly reduces observational uncertainties and thus allows us to examine the mass distribution in the galaxies in detail. We decompose the rotation curves in terms of the dynamical contributions by baryons and dark matter (DM) halos, and compare the latter with those of dwarf galaxies from THINGS as well as {$\Lambda$}CDM Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations in which the effect of baryonic feedback processes is included. Being generally consistent with THINGS and simulated dwarf galaxies, most of the LITTLE THINGS sample galaxies show a linear increase of the rotation curve in their inner regions, which gives shallower logarithmic inner slopes {$\alpha$} of their DM density profiles. The mean value of the slopes of the 26 LITTLE THINGS dwarf galaxies is {$\alpha$} =-0.32+/- 0.24 which is in accordance with the previous results found for low surface brightness galaxies ({$\alpha$} =-0.2+/- 0.2) as well as the seven THINGS dwarf galaxies ({$\alpha$} =-0.29+/- 0.07). However, this significantly deviates from the cusp-like DM distribution predicted by DM-only {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations. Instead our results are more in line with the shallower slopes found in the {$\Lambda$}CDM SPH simulations of dwarf galaxies in which the effect of baryonic feedback processes is included. In addition, we discuss the central DM distribution of DDO 210 whose stellar mass is relatively low in our sample to examine the scenario of inefficient supernova feedback in low mass dwarf galaxies predicted from recent {$\Lambda$}CDM SPH simulations of dwarf galaxies where central cusps still remain.},

  abstract = {The Milky Way induces a strong tidal perturbation on its satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We present numerical simulations of tidal interactions between these low-density dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the Milky Way. Our results indicate that dwarf spheroidal galaxies with limiting radius much larger than the theoretical tidal radius are unstable and likely to be tidally disrupted on a Hubble time. However, dwarf spheroidal gal galaxies can survive over a Hubble time if their limiting radii are less than twice their tidal radii at perigalacticon. In a galaxy which is undergoing tidal disruption, (1) the projected surface density is flattened in the galaxy's orbital plane and follows a power-law distribution from the galaxy's center, (2) the velocity dispersion is sustained at the current virial equilibrium value, and (3) the central density of the residual remnant is maintained even after most of the initial mass is lost. Beyond the tidal radius, the escapers have a radial velocity gradient along the azimuthal direction of the galaxy's motion. When compared with observational data, our theoretical results are consistent with the scenarios that (1) some dwarf spheroidal galaxies contain dark matter, and (2) some dwarf spheroidal galaxies may be part of the debris that was tidally torn from the LMC by the Galaxy.},

The main sequence turnoff is easily visible. Fits to evolutionary isochrones and the globular cluster M92 indicate that Ursa Minor has an age and metal abundance very similar to that of the latter cluster. No evidence for stars younger than about 16 billion years is seen, with the possible exception of approximately 20 stars believed to be blue stragglers. Ursa Minor is therefore an extreme-age galaxy, unlike superficially similar objects such as the Carina dwarf. Indeed, Ursa Minor may be the only outer-halo spheroidal whose stellar content lives up to the classical ideals of a Population II system. A surprising result of the study is the discovery of clumpiness in the distribution of stars. This finding may give more weight to the idea that dwarf spheroidal galaxies were previously dwarf irregular galaxies, although clearly, if so, Ursa Minor must have lost its gaseous content very soon after formation.},

Of the 118 stars in our sample with multiple observations, six are velocity variables with X{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} probabilities below 0.001. We use Monte Carlo simulations that mimic our observations to determine the efficiency with which our observations find binary stars. Our best, though significantly uncertain, estimate of the binary frequency for stars near the turnoff in Draco and UMi is 0.2-0.3 per decade of period in the vicinity of periods of one year, which is 3-5X that found for the solar neighborhood. This frequency is high enough that binary stars might significantly affect the measured velocity dispersions of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies according to some previous numerical experiments. However, in the course of performing our own experiments, we discovered that this previous work had inadvertently overestimated binary orbital velocities. Our first set of simulations of the effects of binaries is based on the observed scatter in the individual velocity measurements for the multiply-observed Draco and Ursa Minor stars. This scatter is small compared to measured velocity dispersions and, so, the effect of binaries on the dispersions is slight. This result is supported by our second set of experiments, which are based on a model binary population normalized by the observed binary frequency in Draco and Ursa Minor. We conclude that binary stars have had no significant effect on the measured velocity dispersion and inferred mass-to-light ratio of any dwarf spheroidal galaxy.},

  abstract = {The cosmological constant + cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) theory is the 'standard model' of cosmology. Encoded in it are extremely accurate descriptions of the large scale structure of the Universe, despite a very limited number of degrees of freedom. The model struggles, however, to explain some measurements on galactic and smaller scales. The shape of the dark matter distribution toward the centres of galaxies is predicted to be steeply increasing in density ('cuspy') by the theory, yet observations of the rotation curves of some galaxies suggest that it instead reaches a central density plateau (a 'core'). This discrepancy is termed the 'cusp-core problem'. I propose a new way of quantifying this problem as a diversity in the central mass content of galaxies. This characterization does not distinguish between dark and ordinary ('baryonic') matter, but the apparent problem is so severe that the signature of the cusp-core discrepancy is still obvious. By formulating the problem in this way, several uncertain modelling steps are effectively removed from the discussion, allowing for a more narrowly focussed examination of remaining steps in the analysis. My subsequent comparison of recent results from galaxy formation simulations and observed galaxies in the space of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) reveals some galaxies with an apparent anomalously low dark matter content not only in the centre, but out to the largest measurable radii. These objects are very difficult to explain within the {$\Lambda$}CDM framework; the most plausible interpretation which emerges is that the effect of systematic uncertainties in modelling the kinematics in these galaxies -- particularly in the estimate of their inclinations -- has been substantially underestimated. This motivates a re-examination of rotation curve measurement methods. I use a collection of simulated galaxies to demonstrate that, when these are synthetically 'observed' and modelled analogously to real galaxies, non-circular motions present in the gas discs give the appearance of cores, even though all of the simulated galaxies have central cusps. The errors are large enough to reproduce the full width of the observed scatter in rotation curve shapes. Provided the simulations produce sufficiently faithful models of real galaxies, these modelling errors could constitute a solution to the cusp-core problem within the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm. Regardless, the kinematic models must be better understood before drawing any strong cosmological conclusions.},

  abstract = {In the standard Lambda cold dark matter paradigm, pure dark matter simulations predict dwarf galaxies should inhabit dark matter haloes with a centrally diverging density `cusp'. This is in conflict with observations that typically favour a constant density `core'. We investigate this `cusp-core problem' in `ultra-faint' dwarf galaxies simulated as part of the `Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge' project. We find, similarly to previous work, that gravitational potential fluctuations within the central region of the simulated dwarfs kinematically heat the dark matter particles, lowering the dwarfs' central dark matter density. However, these fluctuations are not exclusively caused by gas inflow/outflow, but also by impulsive heating from minor mergers. We use the genetic modification approach on one of our dwarf's initial conditions to show how a delayed assembly history leads to more late minor mergers and, correspondingly, more dark matter heating. This provides a mechanism by which even ultra-faint dwarfs (\$M\_* {\textbackslash}lt 10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$), in which star formation was fully quenched at high redshift, can have their central dark matter density lowered over time. In contrast, we find that late major mergers can regenerate a central dark matter cusp, if the merging galaxy had sufficiently little star formation. The combination of these effects leads us to predict significant stochasticity in the central dark matter density slopes of the smallest dwarfs, driven by their unique star formation and mass assembly histories.},

  abstract = {The Hercules ultrafaint dwarf galaxy (UFD) has long been hypothesized to be tidally disrupting, yet no conclusive evidence has been found for tidal disruption owing partly to difficulties in identifying Hercules member stars. In this work, we present a homogeneous reanalysis of new and existing observations of Hercules, including the detection of a new potential member star located {$\sim$}1{$^\circ$} ({$\sim$}1.7 kpc) west of the center of the system. In addition to measuring the line-of-sight velocity gradient, we compare predictions from dynamical models of stream formation to these observations. We report an updated velocity dispersion measurement based on 28 stars, km s-1, which is significantly lower than previous measurements. We find that the line-of-sight velocity gradient is km s-1 kpc along the major axis of Hercules, consistent with zero within 1{$\sigma$}. Our dynamical models of stream formation, on the other hand, can reproduce the morphology of the Hercules UFD, specifically the misalignment between the elongation and the orbital motion direction. Additionally, these dynamical models indicate that any radial velocity gradient from tidal disruption would be too small, km s-1 kpc, to be detectable with current sample sizes. Combined with our analysis of the tidal radius evolution of the system as a function of its orbital phase, we argue that it is likely that Hercules is indeed currently undergoing tidal disruption in its extended stellar halo with a line-of-sight velocity gradient too small to be detected with current observational data sets. *This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at the Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

We apply this method to a new Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) spectroscopic survey of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dSph. We identify 892 likely members, making this the largest UMi sample with line-of-sight velocity and metallicity measurements. Our Bayesian method detects two distinct chemodynamic populations with high significance (in logarithmic Bayes factor, ln B {\textasciitilde} 33). The metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -2.05 {\textpm} 0.03) population is kinematically colder (radial velocity dispersion of \${\textbackslash}sigma \_v=4.9\_\{-1.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.8\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) and more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor (\$[\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe/H\}]=-2.29\_\{-0.06\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\$) and kinematically hotter population (\${\textbackslash}sigma \_v =11.5\_\{-0.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.9\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). Furthermore, we apply the same analysis to an independent Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT)/Hectochelle data set and confirm the existence of two chemodynamic populations in UMi. In both data sets, the metal-rich population is significantly flattened ({$\epsilon$} = 0.75 {\textpm} 0.03) and the metal-poor population is closer to spherical (\${\textbackslash}epsilon =0.33\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$). Despite the presence of two populations, we are able to robustly estimate the slope of the dynamical mass profile. We found hints for prolate rotation of order \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}2 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in the MMT data set, but further observations are required to verify this. The flattened metal-rich population invalidates assumptions built into simple dynamical mass estimators, so we computed new astrophysical dark matter annihilation (J) and decay profiles based on the rounder, hotter metal-poor population and inferred \${\textbackslash}log \_\{10\}\{(J(0\{{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\_\{.\}\}5)/\{{\textbackslash}rm GeV{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}, cm{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\})\}{\textbackslash}approx 19.1\$ for the Keck data set.

For these orbits, we use a Monte Carlo sample for the observational uncertainties for each dSph and the uncertainties in the MW and LMC potentials. We predict that Ant II, Boo III, Cra II, Gru II, and Tuc III should be tidally disrupting by comparing each dSph's average density relative to the MW density at its pericenter. dSphs with large ellipticity (CVn I, Her, Tuc V, UMa I, UMa II, UMi, Wil 1) show a preference for their orbital direction to align with their major axis even for dSphs with large pericenters. We compare the dSph radial orbital phase to subhalos in MW-like N-body simulations and infer that there is not an excess of satellites near their pericenter. With projections of future Gaia data releases, we find that dSph's orbital precision will be limited by uncertainties in the distance and/or MW potential rather than in proper motion precision.

  abstract = {We present a new, probabilistic method for determining the systemic proper motions of Milky Way (MW) ultra-faint satellites in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We utilize the superb photometry from the first public data release (DR1) of the DES to select candidate members and cross-match them with the proper motions from the Gaia DR2. We model the candidate members with a mixture model (satellite and MW) in spatial and proper motion space. This method does not require prior knowledge of satellite membership and can successfully determine the tangential motion of 13 DES satellites. With our method, we present measurements of the following satellites: Columba I, Eridanus III, Grus II, Phoenix II, Pictor I, Reticulum III, and Tucana IV. This is the first systemic proper motion measurement for several of these satellites, and the majority lack extensive spectroscopic follow-up studies. We compare these to the predictions of Large Magellanic Cloud satellites and the vast polar structure. With the high-precision DES photometry, we conclude that most of the newly identified member stars are very metal-poor ([Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -2), similar to other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, while Reticulum III is likely more metal-rich. We also find potential members in the following satellites that might indicate their overall proper motion: Cetus II, Kim 2, and Horologium II. However, due to the small number of members in each satellite, spectroscopic follow-up observations are necessary to determine the systemic proper motion in these satellites.},

  abstract = {The Lambda cold dark matter (DM) model successfully explains the distribution of large scale structure and the cosmic microwave background but, there are several problems concerning the distribution of DM on sub-galactic scales. Robust measurements of the distribution of DM in low mass dwarf galaxies are key to understand the true nature of DM. In this work, we present two new techniques for characterizing the kinematics of dispersion supported systems. The first method identifies localized kinematic substructure in line-of-sight velocity data while the second separates global stellar populations utilizing metallicty, line-of-sight velocity, and spatial information. We apply the first method to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor and find two localized kinematic substructures at high significance. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of Ursa Minor, motivated by the previous detection, which form the largest spectroscopic data set of Ursa Minor. With the new data, we identify two chemodynamical stellar population at high significance with distinct kinematic, metallicity, and spatial distributions. By utilizing the dynamics of multiple stellar populations we break halo profile degeneracies and find the DM slope is more consistent with a 'cored' halo than a 'cuspy' halo. We present a complementary study comparing a large sample of literature rotation curves to dark matter halos influenced by baryonic processes. The analysis suggests that baryonic processes are an inconsistent solution to the 'core-cusp' problem.},

I present publicly available examples and use cases of the LVDB focused on the census and population-level properties of the Local Group and discuss some theoretical avenues. The next decade will be an exciting era for near-field cosmology with many upcoming surveys and facilities, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Euclid mission, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that will both discover new dwarf galaxies and star clusters in the Local Volume and characterize known dwarf galaxies and star clusters in more detail than ever before. The LVDB will be continually updated and is built to support and enable future dwarf galaxy and star cluster research in this data-rich era.

  abstract = {This thesis provides evidence that the outer halo of the Milky Way Galaxy has in the past, and continues presently, to accumulate stars and stellar systems from satellite galaxies. The results of three experiments support this conclusion: We search the distribution of possible orbital poles of all Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters for co-orbiting objects, an expected signature for the products of tidal disruption. The principal results are: (1)It is statistically more likely that outer halo (Rgc {$>$} 8 kpc) ``red horizontal branch'' globular clusters share orbits similar to the dwarf satellite galaxies than do outer halo ``blue horizontal branch/metal-poor'' globular clusters. (2)The most distant, outer halo globular clusters (Rgc {$>$} 25 kpc) Pal 4, NGC 6229, NGC 7006, and Pyxis are most likely to share an orbit with the Galactic satellite galaxies. A more complete, dynamical analysis of those globular clusters and satellite galaxies with known space motions finds little evidence for common orbits among the 41 clusters and any of the 6 satellite galaxies. This is to be expected, however, since the majority of the 41 globular clusters are inner halo (Rgc {$<$} 8 kpc), blue horizontal branch/metal-poor or disk clusters. Motivated by the study above, a first measurement of the radial velocity of the Pyxis globular cluster is presented, and reveals that it can only share the orbital pole of the Magellanic Clouds (an association predicted by the orbital pole analysis) if it is on an eccentric orbit ({$\varepsilon$} {$>$} 0.7). However, the few outer halo clusters with known orbits are found on very eccentric orbits. An analysis of the Ursa Minor dwarf galaxy reveals a large population of stars outside its nominal tidal radius. These stars, if unbound to Ursa Minor, suggest that the galaxy is losing up to a third of its mass per Gyr to the Milky Way, a conclusion that supports the overall premise of this thesis, that the Galaxy is growing from the accretion of satellite galaxies. The morphology of this satellite galaxy is peculiar even within its tidal radius, which further suggests an ongoing interaction with the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {All stellar evolution models require an initial isotopic abundance set as input, but these abundances are well known only for the Sun. Yet, input compositions can be estimated by scaling solar abundances using a previously constructed isotopic history model based on astrophysical processes in the Galaxy. This method, however, may not work for obtaining inputs for compositions that have distinct chemical histories from the Galaxy. We thus present a partial isotopic history model for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy based on astrophysical processes, which can be used to estimate input isotopic abundances in future nucleosynthesis studies. The model is fitted to observational data, and follows the methodology of the previously constructed isotopic history model for the Galaxy. First, we estimate the isotopic composition of Sculptor's late-stage evolution (LSE) using the OMEGA chemical evolution code, and then decompose that composition into contributions from various astrophysical sources. Each contribution is then assumed to scale as a function of metallicity. The isotopic abundances are summed into elemental abundances and fit to available observational elemental abundance data to tune the model's free parameters. The result is an average isotopic history model of Sculptor for massive star, Type Ia SNe, s-process, and r-process contributions that uses elemental data to constrain the isotopic abundances. As an example, our model finds that Type Ia SNe contribute {$\approx$} 87 percent to the LSE Fe abundance, and neutron star mergers contribute {$\approx$} 36 percent to the LSE Eu abundance, in agreement with previous studies.},

We present a set of simulated streams from disrupted dwarf galaxies in 13 cosmological simulations of Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 suite at z = 0, including seven isolated MW-mass systems and six hosts resembling the MW-M31 pair. In total, we identify 106 simulated stellar streams, with no significant differences in the number of streams and the masses of their progenitors between the isolated and paired environments. We resolve simulated streams with stellar masses ranging from {\textasciitilde}5 {\texttimes} 105 up to {\textasciitilde}109 M{$\odot$}, similar to the mass range between the Orphan and Sagittarius streams in the MW. We confirm that present-day simulated satellite galaxies are good proxies for stellar stream progenitors, with similar properties including their stellar mass function, velocity dispersion, [Fe/H] and [{$\alpha$}/H] evolution tracks, and orbital distribution with respect to the galactic disk plane. Each progenitor's lifetime is marked by several important timescales: its infall, star formation quenching, and stream formation times. We show that the ordering of these timescales is different between progenitors with stellar masses higher and lower than {\textasciitilde}2 {\texttimes} 106 M{$\odot$}. Finally, we show that the main factor controlling the rate of phase mixing, and therefore the rate of fading, of tidal streams from satellite galaxies in MW-mass hosts is the nonadiabatic evolution of the host potential. Other factors commonly used to predict phase-mixing timescales, such as progenitor mass and orbital circularity, show virtually no correlation with the number of dynamical times required for a stream to become phase-mixed.},

Stellar masses are calculated based on optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and atomic gas masses are calculated using atomic hydrogen (H I) emission line data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. By using the technique of abundance matching, we combine the measured baryonic function of galaxies with the dark matter halo mass function in a {$\Lambda$}CDM universe, in order to determine the galactic baryon fraction as a function of host halo mass. We find that the baryon fraction of low-mass halos is much smaller than the cosmic value, even when atomic gas is taken into account. We find that the galactic baryon deficit increases monotonically with decreasing halo mass, in contrast with previous studies which suggested an approximately constant baryon fraction at the low-mass end. We argue that the observed baryon fractions of low-mass halos cannot be explained by reionization heating alone, and that additional feedback mechanisms (e.g., supernova blowout) must be invoked. However, the outflow rates needed to reproduce our result are not easily accommodated in the standard picture of galaxy formation in a {$\Lambda$}CDM universe.},

Many of these faint satellites are posited to have been accreted as satellites of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). Using their six-dimensional phase-space information, we calculate the orbital histories of 13 ultrafaint satellites and five classical dwarf spheroidals in a combined MW+LMC+SMC potential to determine which galaxies are dynamically associated with the MCs. These 18 galaxies are separated into four classes: (I) long-term Magellanic satellites that have been bound to the MCs for at least the last two consecutive orbits around the MCs (Carina 2, Carina 3, Horologium 1, Hydrus 1); (II) Magellanic satellites that were recently captured by the MCs {$<$} 1 Gyr ago (Reticulum 2, Phoenix 2); (III) MW satellites that have interacted with the MCs (Sculptor 1, Tucana 3, Segue 1); and (IV) MW satellites (Aquarius 2, Canes Venatici 2, Crater 2, Draco 1, Draco 2, Hydra 2, Carina, Fornax, Ursa Minor). Results are reported for a range of MW and LMC masses. Contrary to previous work, we find no dynamical association between Carina, Fornax, and the MCs. Finally, we determine that the addition of the SMC's gravitational potential affects the longevity of satellites as members of the Magellanic system (long-term versus recently captured), but it does not change the total number of Magellanic satellites.},

  abstract = {Using stellar-dynamical calculations it is shown for the first time that counter-orbiting material emerges naturally in tidal interactions of disc galaxies. Model particles on both pro- and retrograde orbits can be formed as tidal debris in single encounters with disc galaxies of 1-to-1 and 4-to-1 mass ratios. A total of 74 model calculations are performed for a range of different initial parameters. Interactions include fly-by and merger cases. The fraction of counter-orbiting material produced varies over a wide range (from a few up to 50 percent). All fly-by models show a similar two-phase behaviour, with retrograde material forming first. Properties of the prograde and retrograde populations are extracted to make an observational discrimination possible. During such encounters the tidal debris occupies a certain region in phase space. In this material, tidal-dwarf galaxies may form. The modelling therefore can explain why galaxies may have dwarf galaxies orbiting counter to the bulk of their dwarf galaxies. An example is the Sculptor dwarf of the Milky Way, which orbits counter to the bulk of the disc of satellites. The modelling thus supports the scenario of the MW satellites being ancient tidal-dwarf galaxies formed from gaseous material stripped from another galaxy during an encounter with the young MW. A possible candidate for this galaxy is identified as the Magellanic Cloud progenitor galaxy. Its angular motion fits the angular motion of the MW disc of satellites objects. This scenario is in agreement with Lynden-Bell's original suggestion for the origin of the dSph satellites and the near-unbound orbit of the LMC.

  abstract = {The general qualitative behavior of linear, first-order density perturbations in a Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmological model with radiation and matter has been known for some time in the various limiting situations. An exact quantitative calculation which traces the entire history of the density fluctuations is lacking because the usual approximations of a very short photon mean free path before plasma recombination, and a very long mean free path after, are inadequate. We present here results of the direct integration of the collision equation of the photon distribution function, which enable us to treat in detail the complicated regime of plasma recombination. Starting from an assumed initial power spectrum well before recombination, we obtain a final spectrum of density perturbations after recombination. The calculations are carried out for several general-relativity models and one scalar-tensor model. One can identify two characteristic masses in the final power spectrum: one is the mass within the Hubble radius ct at recombination, and the other results from the linear dissipation of the perturbations prior to recombination. Conceivably the first of these numbers is associated with the great rich clusters of galaxies, the second with the large galaxies. We compute also the expected residual irregularity in the radiation from the primeval fireball. If we assume that (1) the rich clusters formed from an initially adiabatic perturbation and (2) the fireball radiation has not been seriously perturbed after the epoch of recombination of the primeval plasma, then with an angular resolution of t minute of arc the rms fluctuation in antenna temperature should be at least {$\Delta$} = 0.00015.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to explore the effects of tidal stripping on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically motivated initial conditions where dSphs are modeled as King spheres, embedded in Navarro-Frenk-White dark halos and orbiting the Galactic potential on eccentric orbits. As expected, systems that orbit through dense regions of the Galaxy lose a significant fraction of stars after each pericentric passage. These episodes of mass loss, however, do not impose a clear tidal cutoff on the bound stellar core. Rather, once equilibrium has been re-established the outer mass profile approaches a power law well described by a simple Plummer model. As noted in earlier work, tides also result in transient features in the outer density profile. As the system relaxes, an outward-moving "excess" of stars is found at radii where the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsed since pericenter. If the orbit of the dSph is known, these results provide a simple way to assess whether "breaks" and "bumps" in the outer profile of dSphs are actually tidal in origin. We apply this to the Sagittarius dwarf and, encouragingly, identify two features in the surface brightness profile that may be traced to its two last pericentric passages. Applied to Leo I, our results predict that any tidal break would occur at radii beyond those surveyed by current data, casting doubt on recent claims of the detection of tidal debris around this galaxy. For Carina, our model indicates that the tidal break should occur at a radius twice farther than observed. This suggests that the outer excess of stars in Carina is not tidal in origin unless its orbit is in error. A similar comment applies to Sculptor, whose pericenter appears too large for Galactic tides to be important but whose outer profile, like that of Draco, nonetheless follows closely a Plummer law. Fornax and Leo II show no sign of a power-law outer profile, suggesting that they have not been significantly affected by tides. Published profiles for other Milky Way dSph companions do not extend sufficiently far to allow for conclusive assessment. Panoramic surveys that extend surface brightness profiles beyond {\textasciitilde}10 core radii, together with improved constraints on the orbital parameters of dSphs, are needed in order to establish the true origin of the outer envelopes of stars surrounding dSphs.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to study the effects that a divergent (i.e. `cuspy') dark matter profile introduces on the tidal evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically motivated initial conditions where dSphs are dark-matter-dominated systems on eccentric orbits about a host galaxy composed of a dark halo and a baryonic disc. We find that the resilience of dSphs to tidal stripping is extremely sensitive to the cuspiness of the inner halo profile; whereas dwarfs with a cored profile can be easily destroyed by the disc component, those with cusps always retain a bound remnant, even after losing more than 99.99 per cent of the original mass. For a given halo profile, the evolution of the structural parameters as driven by tides is controlled solely by the total amount of mass lost. This information is used to construct a semi-analytic code that follows the tidal evolution of individual satellites as they fall into a more massive host, which allows us to simulate the hierarchical build-up of spiral galaxies assuming different halo profiles and disc masses. We find that tidal encounters with discs tend to decrease the average mass of satellite galaxies at all galactocentric radii. Of all satellites, those accreted before re-ionization (z {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 6), which may be singled out by anomalous metallicity patterns, provide the strongest constraints on the inner profile of dark haloes. These galaxies move on orbits that penetrate the disc repeatedly and survive to the present day only if haloes have an inner density cusp. We show that the size-mass relationship established from Milky Way (MW) dwarfs strongly supports the presence of cusps in the majority of these systems, as cored models systematically underestimate the masses of the known ultra-faint dSphs. Our models also indicate that a massive M31 disc may explain why many of its dSphs with suitable kinematic data fall below the size-mass relationship derived from MW dSphs. We also examine whether our modelling can constrain the mass threshold below which star formation is suppressed in dark matter haloes. We find that luminous satellites must be accreted with masses above 108-109Msolar in order to explain the size-mass relation observed in MW dwarfs.},

Motivated by this result, we apply a Bayesian technique devised by Pe{\~n}arrubia et~al. to simultaneously fit (i) distances and velocities of galaxies within 3~Mpc and (ii) the relative motion between the Milky Way and Andromeda derived from HST observations, with the LMC mass (MLMC) as a free parameter.

  abstract = {We use analytical and \$N\$-body methods to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes that host a sizeable subhalo population. Dark subhaloes generate a fluctuating gravitational field that injects energy into stellar orbits, driving a gradual expansion of dSphs. Despite the overall expansion, the stellar density profile preserves its initial shape, suggesting that the evolution proceeds in a self-similar manner. Meanwhile, the velocity dispersion profile, initially flat, evolves as the galaxy expands: the inner regions heat up, while the outer regions cool down. Kinematically, this resembles gravothermal collapse but with an inverted evolution, instead of collapsing the stellar system expands within a fluctuating halo potential. As the half-light radius \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm half\}\$ approaches the halo peak velocity radius \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$, the expansion slows, and the velocity dispersion peaks at \${$\sigma\_$}\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} {\textbackslash}simeq 0.27 v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$. The stellar heat capacity remains positive for deeply embedded stars but diverges near \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$, turning negative beyond this threshold, which indicates a phase transition in the dynamical response to energy injection. The relaxation time scales as \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rel\} {\textbackslash}sim r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm half\}{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}\$, showing that orbital diffusion slows as the galaxy expands. Ultra-faint dSphs, having the smallest sizes and shortest relaxation times, are particularly sensitive to the presence of dark subhaloes. Some of our dSph models expand beyond the detection of current photometric surveys, becoming `stealth' galaxies with half-light radii and velocity dispersions similar to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), but orders of magnitude lower luminosities, representing a distinct, yet currently undetected, population of DM-dominated satellites.},

  abstract = {We use the APOSTLE suite of cosmological simulations to examine the role of the cosmic ionizing background in regulating star formation (SF) in low-mass LCDM halos. In agreement with earlier work, we find that, after reionization, SF can only proceed in halos whose mass exceeds a redshift-dependent ``critical'' virial mass determined by the structure of LCDM halos and the thermal pressure of UV-heated gas. This critical mass increases from Mcrit{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun at z{\textasciitilde}11\$ to {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}9.7 Msun at z=0, roughly following the average mass growth history of halos in that mass range. This implies that most halos above or below critical at present have remained so since early times. In particular, the halos of most galaxies today were already above-critical (and thus forming stars) at high redshift, providing a simple explanation for the ubiquitous presence of ancient stellar populations in dwarfs, regardless of luminosity. It also implies that Mcrit today represents a ``threshold'' mass below which the fraction of ``dark'' halos increases steeply. Sub-critical halos may still host luminous galaxies if they were above-critical at some point in the past. SF ceases if a halo falls into the sub-critical regime; depending on each halo's accretion history this can occur over a wide range of times, explaining why SF in many dwarfs seems to continue well past the reionization epoch. It also suggests a tantalizing explanation for the episodic nature of SF in some dwarfs, which, in this interpretation, would be linked to temporary halo excursions above and below the critical boundary. In the simulations, Mcrit(z) cleanly separates star-forming from non-star-forming systems at all redshifts, indicating that the ionizing UV background, and not stellar feedback, is what regulates the beginning and the end of SF in the faintest dwarfs. Galaxies in sub-critical halos should make up a sizable population of faint field dwarfs, distinct from those in more massive halos because of their lack of ongoing star formation. Although few such galaxies are known at present, the discovery of this population would provide strong support for our results.},

In this review we discuss in a unified manner many existing signals in cosmological and astrophysical data that appear to be in some tension (2 {$\sigma$} or larger) with the standard {$\Lambda$}CDM model as specified by the Cosmological Principle, General Relativity and the Planck18 parameter values. In addition to the well-studied 5 {$\sigma$} challenge of {$\Lambda$}CDM (the Hubble H0 tension) and other well known tensions (the growth tension, and the lensing amplitude AL anomaly), we discuss a wide range of other less discussed less-standard signals which appear at a lower statistical significance level than the H0 tension some of them known as 'curiosities' in the data) which may also constitute hints towards new physics. For example such signals include cosmic dipoles (the fine structure constant {$\alpha$}, velocity and quasar dipoles), CMB asymmetries, BAO Ly {$\alpha$} tension, age of the Universe issues, the Lithium problem, small scale curiosities like the core-cusp and missing satellite problems, quasars Hubble diagram, oscillating short range gravity signals etc. The goal of this pedagogical review is to collectively present the current status (2022 update) of these signals and their level of significance, with emphasis on the Hubble tension and refer to recent resources where more details can be found for each signal. We also briefly discuss theoretical approaches that can potentially explain some of these signals.},

We show first that by going to Hill's limit of vanishing masses, one can reduce the problem to a simpler form in which only one dimensionless parameter remains: the reduced impact parameter. We present then a detailed study of the family obtained when this parameter is varied. Each orbit consists of three phases: approach of the two small bodies, interplay, and departure. Fourth-order series are used to represent the asymptotic motion of the two small bodies in the approach and departure phases; these series are matched with a numerical integration of the interplay phase to give an accurate representation of the entire orbit. For each orbit, we compute the net effect of the encounter, essentially characterized by an increase of the separation of the satellite orbits. We compute also the minimal distance of approach of the two satellites. In the limiting cases of large and small impact parameters, the results are compared with the predictions of perturbation theories. Finally we study the ``transitions,'' which are apparent discontinuities of the family with a sudden change of the direction of departure. We show that they can be explained by the asymptotic approach of the orbit to an unstable periodic solution of Hill's problem. Transitions take place for infinitely many values of the parameter, forming a Cantor-like set.},

  abstract = {We present a dynamical friction model based on Chandrasekhar's formula that reproduces the fast inspiral and stalling experienced by satellites orbiting galaxies with a large constant density core. We show that the fast inspiral phase does not owe to resonance. Rather, it owes to the background velocity distribution function for the constant density core being dissimilar from the usually assumed Maxwellian distribution. Using the correct background velocity distribution function and our semi-analytic model from previous work, we are able to correctly reproduce the infall rate in both cored and cusped potentials. However, in the case of large cores, our model is no longer able to correctly capture core-stalling. We show that this stalling owes to the tidal radius of the satellite approaching the size of the core. By switching off dynamical friction when rt(r) = r (where rt is the tidal radius at the satellite's position), we arrive at a model which reproduces the N-body results remarkably well. Since the tidal radius can be very large for constant density background distributions, our model recovers the result that stalling can occur for Ms/Menc {$\ll$} 1, where Ms and Menc are the mass of the satellite and the enclosed galaxy mass, respectively. Finally, we include the contribution to dynamical friction that comes from stars moving faster than the satellite. This next-to-leading order effect becomes the dominant driver of inspiral near the core region, prior to stalling.},

  abstract = {This article presents a measurement of the proper motion of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy determined from images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in two distinct fields. Each field contains a quasi-stellar object that serves as the ``reference point.'' The measured proper motion for Ursa Minor, expressed in the equatorial coordinate system, is ({$\mu\alpha$},{$\mu\delta$})=(-50+/-17,22+/-16) mas century-1. Removing the contributions of the solar motion and the motion of the local standard of rest yields the proper motion in the Galactic rest frame: ({$\mu$}Grf{$\alpha$},{$\mu$}Grf{$\delta$})=(-8+/-17,38+/-16) mas century-1. The implied space velocity with respect to the Galactic center has a radial component of Vr=-75+/-44 km s-1 and a tangential component of Vt=144+/-50 km s-1. Integrating the motion of Ursa Minor in a realistic potential for the Milky Way produces orbital elements. The perigalacticon and apogalacticon are 40 (10, 76) and 89 (78, 160) kpc, respectively, where the values in the parentheses represent the 95\% confidence intervals derived from Monte Carlo experiments. The eccentricity of the orbit is 0.39 (0.09, 0.79), and the orbital period is 1.5 (1.1, 2.7) Gyr. The orbit is retrograde and inclined by 124{$^\circ$} (94{$^\circ$}, 136{$^\circ$}) to the Galactic plane. Ursa Minor is not a likely member of a proposed stream of galaxies on similar orbits around the Milky Way, nor is the plane of its orbit coincident with a recently proposed planar alignment of galaxies around the Milky Way. Comparing the orbits of Ursa Minor and Carina shows no reason for the different star formation histories of these two galaxies. Ursa Minor must contain dark matter to have a high probability of having survived disruption by the Galactic tidal force until the present.

  abstract = {We have performed numerical simulations to investigate whether galactic tides can elevate the apparent mass-to-light ratio (M/L) in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). In our simulations the dSph is composed only of luminous matter and falls towards the Milky Way on various orbits and in various galactic potentials starting from apogalacticon. We assume a single perigalacticon passage in which the close encounter with the Milky Way produces strong tides that greatly affect the structure and the kinematics of the dSph. We find that even when tides affect the structure and the kinematics of the dSph, they fail to inflate the central M/L. Tides produce large ordered motions rather than large random motions; a clear signature of these motions is apparent rotation. Tides can inflate the global M/L to a value as large as {\textasciitilde}40; however, this is solely due to the ordered motions. Comparing our results with real dSphs, we conclude that galactic tides at the most recent pericenter passage have not inflated the apparent M/L `s.},

  abstract = {In the era of precision cosmology, it is essential to determine the Hubble constant empirically with an accuracy of one per cent or better1. At present, the uncertainty on this constant is dominated by the uncertainty in the calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity relationship2,3 (also known as the Leavitt law). The Large Magellanic Cloud has traditionally served as the best galaxy with which to calibrate Cepheid period-luminosity relations, and as a result has become the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale4,5. Eclipsing binary systems composed of late-type stars offer the most precise and accurate way to measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Currently the limit of the precision attainable with this technique is about two per cent, and is set by the precision of the existing calibrations of the surface brightness-colour relation5,6. Here we report a calibration of the surface brightness-colour relation with a precision of 0.8 per cent. We use this calibration to determine a geometrical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to 1 per cent based on 20 eclipsing binary systems. The final distance is 49.59 {\textpm} 0.09 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.54 (systematic) kiloparsecs.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5{$\sigma$} level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {$\Lambda$}CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density {\textohm}ch2 = 0.120 {\textpm} 0.001, baryon density {\textohm}bh2 = 0.0224 {\textpm} 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 {\textpm} 0.004, and optical depth {$\tau$} = 0.054 {\textpm} 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100{\texttheta}* = 1.0411 {\textpm} 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 {\textpm} 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter {\textohm}m = 0.315 {\textpm} 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude {$\sigma$}8 = 0.811 {\textpm} 0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 {\textpm} 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to {$\sum$}m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base {$\Lambda$}CDM at over 2{$\sigma$}, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the {$\Lambda$}CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, {\textohm}K = 0.001 {\textpm} 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 {\textpm} 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {$<$} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-{$\Lambda$}CDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6{$\sigma$}, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

  abstract = {We describe the legacy Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) likelihoods derived from the 2018 data release. The overall approach is similar in spirit to the one retained for the 2013 and 2015 data release, with a hybrid method using different approximations at low ({$\ell$} {$<$} 30) and high ({$\ell$} {$\geq$} 30) multipoles, implementing several methodological and data-analysis refinements compared to previous releases. With more realistic simulations, and better correction and modelling of systematic effects, we can now make full use of the CMB polarization observed in the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) channels. The low-multipole EE cross-spectra from the 100 GHz and 143 GHz data give a constraint on the {$\Lambda$}CDM reionization optical-depth parameter {$\tau$} to better than 15\% (in combination with the TT low-{$\ell$} data and the high-{$\ell$} temperature and polarization data), tightening constraints on all parameters with posterior distributions correlated with {$\tau$}. We also update the weaker constraint on {$\tau$} from the joint TEB likelihood using the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) channels, which was used in 2015 as part of our baseline analysis. At higher multipoles, the CMB temperature spectrum and likelihood are very similar to previous releases. A better model of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and corrections for the effective calibrations of the polarization channels (i.e., the polarization efficiencies) allow us to make full use of polarization spectra, improving the {$\Lambda$}CDM constraints on the parameters {\texttheta}MC, {$\omega$}c, {$\omega$}b, and H0 by more than 30\%, and ns by more than 20\% compared to TT-only constraints. Extensive tests on the robustness of the modelling of the polarization data demonstrate good consistency, with some residual modelling uncertainties. At high multipoles, we are now limited mainly by the accuracy of the polarization efficiency modelling. Using our various tests, simulations, and comparison between different high-multipole likelihood implementations, we estimate the consistency of the results to be better than the 0.5 {$\sigma$} level on the {$\Lambda$}CDM parameters, as well as classical single-parameter extensions for the joint likelihood (to be compared to the 0.3 {$\sigma$} levels we achieved in 2015 for the temperature data alone on {$\Lambda$}CDM only). Minor curiosities already present in the previous releases remain, such as the differences between the best-fit {$\Lambda$}CDM parameters for the {$\ell$} {$<$} 800 and {$\ell$} {$>$} 800 ranges of the power spectrum, or the preference for more smoothing of the power-spectrum peaks than predicted in {$\Lambda$}CDM fits. These are shown to be driven by the temperature power spectrum and are not significantly modified by the inclusion of the polarization data. Overall, the legacy Planck CMB likelihoods provide a robust tool for constraining the cosmological model and represent a reference for future CMB observations.},

  abstract = {Analysis of the Planck 2018 data set indicates that the statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies are in excellent agreement with previous studies using the 2013 and 2015 data releases. In particular, they are consistent with the Gaussian predictions of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model, yet also confirm the presence of several so-called "anomalies" on large angular scales. The novelty of the current study, however, lies in being a first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of the statistics of the polarization signal over all angular scales, using either maps of the Stokes parameters, Q and U, or the E-mode signal derived from these using a new methodology (which we describe in an appendix). Although remarkable progress has been made in reducing the systematic effects that contaminated the 2015 polarization maps on large angular scales, it is still the case that residual systematics (and our ability to simulate them) can limit some tests of non-Gaussianity and isotropy. However, a detailed set of null tests applied to the maps indicates that these issues do not dominate the analysis on intermediate and large angular scales (i.e., {$\ell$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 400). In this regime, no unambiguous detections of cosmological non-Gaussianity, or of anomalies corresponding to those seen in temperature, are claimed. Notably, the stacking of CMB polarization signals centred on the positions of temperature hot and cold spots exhibits excellent agreement with the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model, and also gives a clear indication of how Planck provides state-of-the-art measurements of CMB temperature and polarization on degree scales.},

  abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857 GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter ({\texttheta}*) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the {$\Lambda$}CDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) driven by galactic tides. We adopt a cosmologically motivated model where dSphs are approximated by a King model embedded within an NFW halo. We find that these NFW-embedded King models are extraordinarily resilient to tides; the stellar density profile still resembles a King model even after losing more than 99\% of the stars. As tides strip the galaxy, the stellar luminosity, velocity dispersion, central surface brightness, and core radius decrease monotonically. Remarkably, we find that the evolution of these parameters is solely controlled by the total amount of mass lost from within the luminous radius. Of all parameters, the core radius is the least affected: after losing 99\% of the stars, Rc decreases by just a factor of {\textasciitilde}2. Interestingly, tides tend to make dSphs more dark matter-dominated because the tightly bound central dark matter "cusp" is more resilient to disruption than the "cored" King profile. We examine whether the extremely large mass-to-light ratios of the newly discovered ultrafaint dSphs might have been caused by tidal stripping of once-brighter systems. Although dSph tidal evolutionary tracks parallel the observed scaling relations in the luminosity-radius plane, they predict too steep a change in velocity dispersion compared with the observational estimates hitherto reported in the literature. The ultrafaint dwarfs are thus unlikely to be the tidal remnants of systems like Fornax, Draco, or Sagittarius. Despite spanning four decades in luminosity, dSphs appear to inhabit halos of comparable peak circular velocity, lending support to scenarios that envision dSphs as able to form only in halos above a certain mass threshold.},

In the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm, the remaining 95 per cent consists of dark energy ({$\Lambda$}) and cold dark matter. {$\Lambda$}CDM is being challenged by its apparent inability to explain the low-density `cores' of dark matter measured at the centre of galaxies, where centrally concentrated high-density `cusps' were predicted. But before drawing conclusions, it is necessary to include the effect of gas and stars, historically seen as passive components of galaxies. We now understand that these can inject heat energy into the cold dark matter through a coupling based on rapid gravitational potential fluctuations, explaining the observed low central densities.},

We report on results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art, multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the gravitational softening, time-step, force accuracy, initial redshift, and particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the time-step is much shorter than the local orbital time-scale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation time-scale is longer than the age of the Universe. Convergence also requires sufficiently high initial redshift and accurate force computations. Poor spatial, time, or force resolution leads generally to systems with artificially low central density, but may also result in the formation of artificially dense central cusps. We have explored several adaptive time-stepping choices and we have obtained the best results when individual time-steps are chosen according to the local acceleration and the gravitational softening ({$\Delta$}ti{\textasciitilde} ({$\varepsilon$}/ai)1/2), although further experimentation may yield better and more efficient criteria. The most stringent requirement for convergence is typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation criterion. This implies that, in order to estimate accurate circular velocities at radii where the density contrast may reach {\textasciitilde}106, the region must enclose of the order of 3000 particles (or more than a few times 106 within the virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized {$\Lambda$}CDM halo, we find that the spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope shallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, {\textasciitilde}0.005 r200, with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner regions.},

  abstract = {We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a "gas" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes "self-similar" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can "bootstrap" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal "seed" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give only very broad limits, unfortunately.

  abstract = {Published density profiles and central velocity dispersions place important constraints on the stellar velocity ellipsoid and on the distribution of dark matter (DM) in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Draco and Ursa Minor. We adopt central velocity dispersions of 9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Draco and 11 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Ursa Minor. Then, for an isotropic stellar velocity distribution, the central DM densities are {$\rho\_$}0D\_ = 0.8 and 1.0 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}, respectively, if visible and dark matter have the same core radius. If DM has a much larger core radius than visible matter but nevertheless dominates the potential, these densities are reduced by a factor of 2. Central DM densities can be lower than this only if the stellar velocity distribution is anisotropic. We use simple two-component King models to investigate this and to look for the smallest DM densities that are consistent with the observations. In both galaxies we show that {$\rho$}0D{$>$}=0.05 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}. These lower limits are model independent except for the assumption of spherical symmetry. Relaxing this remaining assumption is unlikely to alter the limits. Models with central visible matter densities as large as those of DM are probably just acceptable. In Draco, either the core radii of the luminous and dark matter are similar, or the luminous matter has an anisotropic velocity dispersion, or its dispersion increases with radius.},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies might be destroyed either by internal processes, such as gas loss induced by star formation, or external processes, such as tidal disruption. It is hard to see how gas loss or stellar mass loss can disrupt a galaxy dominated by dark matter. Recent modeling of the tidal destruction of dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the Milky Way has concentrated on what the dwarf would look like during the destruction. A velocity gradient across the galaxy that is larger than the velocity dispersion is the clearest signature. The lack of such gradients in all of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies except Sagittarius means that these galaxies are not being significantly affected by tides and that tides cannot explain their large measured mass-to-light ratios. Sagittarius probably is being destroyed by tides today and models of tidal destruction are being applied to interpret the observations of this galaxy.},

  abstract = {Interactions between galaxies are common, and influence physical properties such as the global morphology and star-formation rate (Hubble type). Galaxies can interact in many different ways: they can merge together; they can pass through each other, with gas being stripped from the smaller of the two and compressed in the larger; and they can interact gravitationally (including, for example, tides in clusters). The relative importance of these mechanisms is often not clear, as the strength of each depends on poorly known parameters such as the density, extent and nature of the dark-matter haloes that surround galaxies. A nearby example of a galaxy interaction where the mechanism is controversial is that between our Galaxy and two of its neighbours, the Magellanic Clouds. Here we present the results of an atomic-hydrogen survey that help to elucidate this mechanism. Our data reveal a new stream of gas that lies in the opposite direction to the trailing Magellanic Stream and leads the motion of the Clouds. The existence of both leading and trailing streams supports a gravitational interaction whereby the streams are torn from the bodies of the Magellanic Clouds by tidal forces.},

For all of the dSphs examined, we find radial velocity matches with stars residing beyond the King limiting radius and with \$\{\}50\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ astrometric probability (four in Draco, two in Ursa Minor, eight in Sextans, two in Sculptor, 12 in Fornax, and five in Carina), indicating that these stars are associated with their respective dSphs at high probability. We compare the positions of our candidate 'extra-tidal' stars with the orbital tracks of the galaxies, and identify stars, both with and without radial velocity matches, that are consistent with lying along the orbital track of the satellites. However, given the small number of candidate stars, we cannot make any conclusive statements about the significance of these spatially correlated stars. Cross matching with publicly available catalogues of RR Lyrae, we find one RR Lyrae candidate with \$\{\}50\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ astrometric probability outside the limiting radius in each of Sculptor and Fornax, two such candidates in Draco, nine in Ursa Minor, seven in Sextans, and zero in Carina. Follow-up spectra on all of our candidates, including possible metallicity information, will help confirm association with their respective dSphs, and could represent evidence for extended stellar haloes or tidal debris around these classical dSphs.},

  abstract = {We derive new, accurate radial velocity (V\_r\_) measurements for 23 Sculptor K-giant stars from high-resolution echelle spectra made with the ESO NTT and 3.6-m telescopes. Comparing our velocities with previous measurements (Armandroff \& Da Costa 1986) for 15 stars, we show that the V\_r\_ measurements are reliable, and discover two V\_r\_ variable stars with large amplitudes ({$>$}17km/s). These variations are best explained by binary orbital motions. As our sample is likely to contain many additional undetected binaries with smaller velocity amplitudes (due to less favorable orbit inclinations, smaller mass ratios, or longer periods), the observations suggest a large binary fraction in Sculptor, possibly larger than {\textasciitilde}20\% within the period limits {\textasciitilde}0.5 to {\textasciitilde}20yrs. This result is consistent with the recent discoveries of 2-3 large-amplitude variable stars in Ursa Minor and Sextant. Previous kinematic studies of dSph galaxies based on single-epoch measurements are consequently not fully reliable. Radial velocity-variable stars artificially inflate the velocity dispersion and the mass-to-light (M/L) ratio estimates. This weakens the case for dark matter, at least in some of the dSph galaxies. In the case of Sculptor, a velocity dispersion of 6.2+/-1.1km/s and a M/L ratio of 13+/-6(M/L\_V\_)sun\_ are derived from our sample. These results do not provide unambiguous evidence for a dominant dark matter component in Sculptor, mainly because our sample is likely to contain additional undetected V\_r\_ variables of lower amplitude.},

  abstract = {Context. Ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are expected to be relics of the earliest galaxies to have formed in the Universe. Observations show the presence of a stellar halo around UFDs, which can give precious insights into UFD evolution. Indeed, stellar halos can form via tidal interaction, early supernova feedback, or merging events. Aims. This work investigates how merger properties impact the formation of stellar halos around UFDs, focusing on Tucana II, the most promising UFD assembled through mergers. Methods. We developed N-body simulations of dry isolated mergers between two UFDs, resolving their stellar component down to 1 M{$\odot$}. We built a suite of simulations by varying: the merger-specific i) angular momentum, l, and ii) kinetic energy k, iii) the merger mass ratio, M1/M2, iv) the dark-to-stellar mass ratio, MDM/M{$\star$}, of the progenitors, and v) their stellar size, R1/2. To fully explore such a five-dimensional parameter space, we trained a neural network to emulate the properties of the resulting "post-merger" UFD, by quantifying the half-mass radius (R{$\star$}) and the fraction of stars at radii {$>$} 5R{$\star$} (f5). Results. Our principal component analysis clearly shows that f5 (R{$\star$}) is primarily determined by M1/M2 (R1/2), with R1/2 (M1/M2) playing a secondary role. Both f5 and R{$\star$} show almost no dependence on k, l, and MDM/M{$\star$} in the explored range. Using our emulator, we find that to form the stellar halo observed in Tucana II; that is, f5 = 10 {\textpm} 5\% and R{$\star$} = 120 {\textpm} 30 pc, we need to merge progenitors with M1/M2 = 8-3+4, the size of the more massive one being R1/2 = 97-18+25 pc. Such findings are corroborated by the consistency ({$\chi$}2 {$\simeq$} 0.5 - 2) between stellar density profiles observed for Tucana II and those of simulations that have M1/M2 and R1/2 close to the values predicted by the emulator. Conclusions. The stellar halos of UFDs contain crucial information about the properties of their smaller progenitor galaxies. Ongoing and planned spectroscopic surveys will greatly increase the statistics of observed stars in UFDs, and thus of their associated stellar halos. By interpreting such observations with our simulations, we will provide new insights into the assembly history of UFDs, and thus the early galaxy formation process.},

Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can tackle or alleviate small-scale issues within the cosmological standard model {$\Lambda$}CDM, and diverse flavours of SIDM can produce unique astrophysical predictions, resulting in different possible signatures which can be used to test these models with dedicated observations of galaxy clusters. Aims: This work aims to assess the impact of dark matter self-interactions on the properties of galaxy clusters. In particular, the goal is to study the angular dependence of the cross section by testing rare (large angle scattering) and frequent (small angle scattering) SIDM models with velocity-dependent cross sections. Methods: We re-simulated six galaxy cluster zoom-in initial conditions with a dark matter-only run and with full-physics set-up simulations that include a self-consistent treatment of baryon physics. We tested the dark matter-only setup and the full physics setup with the collisionless cold dark matter, rare self-interacting dark matter, and frequent self-interacting dark matter models. We then studied their matter density profiles as well as their subhalo population. Results: Our dark matter-only SIDM simulations agree with theoretical models, and when baryons are included in simulations, our SIDM models substantially increase the central density of galaxy cluster cores compared to full-physics simulations using collisionless dark matter. SIDM subhalo suppression in full-physics simulations is milder compared to the one found in the dark matter-only simulations because of the cuspier baryonic potential that prevents subhalo disruption. Moreover, SIDM with small-angle scattering significantly suppresses a larger number of subhaloes compared to large-angle scattering SIDM models. Additionally, SIDM models generate a broader range of subhalo concentration values, including a tail of more diffuse subhaloes in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and a population of more compact subhaloes in the cluster cores.},

  abstract = {There are two main tidal effects that can act on the Local Group dwarf spheroidals (dSphs): tidal stripping and tidal shocking. Using N-body simulations, we show that tidal stripping always leads to flat or rising projected velocity dispersions beyond a critical radius; it is {\textasciitilde}5 times more likely, when averaging over all possible projection angles, that the cylindrically averaged projected dispersion will rise, rather than be flat. In contrast, the Local Group dSphs, as a class, show flat or falling projected velocity dispersions interior to {\textasciitilde}1kpc. This argues for tidal stripping being unimportant interior to {\textasciitilde}1kpc for most of the Local Group dSphs observed so far. We show that tidal shocking may still be important, however, even when tidal stripping is not. This could explain the observed correlation for the Local Group dSphs between central surface brightness and distance from the nearest large galaxy. These results have important implications for the formation of the dSphs and for cosmology. As a result of the existence of cold stars at large radii in several dSphs, a tidal origin for the formation of these Local Group dSphs (in which they contain no dark matter) is strongly disfavoured. In the cosmological context, a naive solution to the missing satellites problem is to allow only the most massive substructure dark matter haloes around the Milky Way to form stars. It is possible for dSphs to reside within these haloes ({\textasciitilde}1010Msolar) and have their velocity dispersions lowered through the action of tidal shocks, but only if they have a central density core in their dark matter, rather than a cusp. A central density cusp persists even after unrealistically extreme tidal shocking and leads to central velocity dispersions which are too high to be consistent with data from the Local Group dSphs. dSphs can reside within cuspy dark matter haloes if their haloes are less massive ({\textasciitilde}109Msolar) and therefore have smaller central velocity dispersions initially.},

  abstract = {We present an improved analytic calculation for the tidal radius of satellites and test our results against N-body simulations. The tidal radius in general depends upon four factors: the potential of the host galaxy, the potential of the satellite, the orbit of the satellite and the orbit of the star within the satellite. We demonstrate that this last point is critical and suggest using three tidal radii to cover the range of orbits of stars within the satellite. In this way we show explicitly that prograde star orbits will be more easily stripped than radial orbits; while radial orbits are more easily stripped than retrograde ones. This result has previously been established by several authors numerically, but can now be understood analytically. For point mass, power-law (which includes the isothermal sphere), and a restricted class of split power-law potentials our solution is fully analytic. For more general potentials, we provide an equation which may be rapidly solved numerically. Over short times ({$<$}{\textasciitilde}1-2Gyr {\textasciitilde}1 satellite orbit), we find excellent agreement between our analytic and numerical models. Over longer times, star orbits within the satellite are transformed by the tidal field of the host galaxy. In a Hubble time, this causes a convergence of the three limiting tidal radii towards the prograde stripping radius. Beyond the prograde stripping radius, the velocity dispersion will be tangentially anisotropic.},

Through N-body simulations and analytic calculations we investigate the extent to which these properties can be generated from `typical'{$\Lambda$}CDM galaxies, which differ in all of these properties, by the dynamical consequences of feedback.We find that, for a wide range of initial conditions, one impulsive mass-loss event will naturally produce a surface brightness profile in the remaining stellar component of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) which is well-fitted over many scalelengths by an exponential, in good qualitative agreement with observations of Local Group dSphs. Furthermore, two impulsive mass-loss phases, punctuated by significant gas re-accretion, are found to be sufficient to transform a central density cusp in the dark matter profile into a near-constant density core. This may then provide the missing link between current cosmological simulations, which predict a central cusp in the dark matter density profile, and current observations, which find much shallower central density profiles.We also look at the angular momentum history of dSphs and demonstrate that if these galaxies have spent most of their lifetime in tidal isolation from massive galaxies then they cannot have formed from high angular momentum gas discs.},

These haloes are just massive enough to efficiently form stars through atomic line cooling and to hold on to their gas in the presence of supernova (SN) winds and reionization. These combined effects, in particular that of the SN feedback, create a sharp transition: over the mass range 3-10 {\texttimes} 107Msolar, the BBBs drop two orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Below {\textasciitilde}2 {\texttimes} 107Msolar, galaxies will be dark with almost no stars and no gas. Above this scale is the smallest unit of galaxy formation: the BBB. We show that the BBBs have stellar distributions which are spheroidal, of low rotational velocity, old and metal poor: they resemble the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group (LG). Unlike the LG dSphs, however, they contain significant gas fractions. We connect these high-redshift BBBs to the smallest dwarf galaxies observed at z = 0 using linear theory. A small fraction ({\textasciitilde}100) of these gas-rich BBBs at high redshift fall in to a galaxy the size of the Milky Way (MW). We suggest that 10 per cent of these survive to become the observed LG dwarf galaxies at the present epoch. This is consistent with recent numerical estimates. Those infalling haloes on benign orbits which keep them far away from the MW or Andromeda manage to retain their gas and slowly form stars - these become the smallest dwarf irregular galaxies; those on more severe orbits lose their gas faster than they can form stars and become the dwarf spheroidals. The remaining 90 per cent of the BBBs will be accreted. We show that this gives a metallicity and total stellar mass consistent with the MW old stellar halo.},

Using a large suite of mock data, we confirm that with only line-of-sight velocity data, GravSphere provides a good estimate of the density at the projected stellar half-mass radius, {$\rho$}(R1/2), but is not able to measure {$\rho$}(r) or {$\beta$}(r), even with 10 000 tracer stars. We then test three popular methods for breaking this {$\rho$} - {$\beta$} degeneracy: using multiple populations with different R1/2; using higher order `virial shape parameters' (VSPs); and including proper motion data. We find that two populations provide an excellent recovery of {$\rho$}(r) in-between their respective R1/2. However, even with a total of {$\sim$}7000 tracers, we are not able to well-constrain {$\beta$}(r) for either population. By contrast, using 1000 tracers with higher order VSPs we are able to measure {$\rho$}(r) over the range 0.5 {$<$} r/R1/2 {$<$} 2 and broadly constrain {$\beta$}(r). Including proper motion data for all stars gives an even better performance, with {$\rho$} and {$\beta$} well-measured over the range 0.25 {$<$} r/R1/2 {$<$} 4. Finally, we test GravSphere on a triaxial mock galaxy that has axis ratios typical of a merger remnant [1 : 0.8 : 0.6]. In this case, GravSphere can become slightly biased. However, we find that when this occurs the data are poorly fit, allowing us to detect when such departures from spherical symmetry become problematic.},

  abstract = {Gravitational potential fluctuations driven by bursty star formation can kinematically `heat up' dark matter at the centres of dwarf galaxies. A key prediction of such models is that, at a fixed dark matter halo mass, dwarfs with a higher stellar mass will have a lower central dark matter density. We use stellar kinematics and HI gas rotation curves to infer the inner dark matter densities of eight dwarf spheroidal and eight dwarf irregular galaxies with a wide range of star formation histories. For all galaxies, we estimate the dark matter density at a common radius of 150\,pc, \${\textbackslash}rho \_\{{\textbackslash}rm DM\}(150{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\})\$. We find that our sample of dwarfs falls into two distinct classes. Those that stopped forming stars over 6\,Gyr ago favour central densities \${\textbackslash}rho \_\{{\textbackslash}rm DM\}(150{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}){\textbackslash}gt 10{\textasciicircum}8\$\,M{$\odot$}\,kpc-3, consistent with cold dark matter cusps, while those with more extended star formation favour \${\textbackslash}rho \_\{{\textbackslash}rm DM\}(150{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}){\textbackslash}lt 10{\textasciicircum}8\$\,M{$\odot$}\,kpc-3, consistent with shallower dark matter cores. Using abundance matching to infer pre-infall halo masses, M200, we show that this dichotomy is in excellent agreement with models in which dark matter is heated up by bursty star formation. In particular, we find that \${\textbackslash}rho \_\{{\textbackslash}rm DM\}(150{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\})\$ steadily decreases with increasing stellar mass-to-halo mass ratio, M*/M200. Our results suggest that, to leading order, dark matter is a cold, collisionless, fluid that can be kinematically `heated up' and moved around.},

The apparent proper motion of Sgr A* relative to J1745-283 is 6.379+/-0.024 mas yr-1 along a position angle of 209.60d+/-0.18d, almost entirely in the plane of the Galaxy. The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy is -0.4+/-0.9 km s-1. A maximum likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within the observed Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that Sgr A* contains more than about 10\% of the {\textasciitilde}4{\texttimes}106 Msolar deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A*, as measured by several investigators, is less than 1 AU, and the implied mass density of {\textasciitilde}1022 Msolar pc-3 is within about 3 orders of magnitude of a comparable supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative source at the center of a galaxy contains of order 106 Msolar and provides overwhelming evidence that it is in the form of a supermassive black hole. Finally, the existence of ``intermediate-mass'' black holes more massive than {\textasciitilde}104 Msolar between roughly 103 and 105 AU from Sgr A* is excluded.},

  abstract = {We present a large sample of fully self-consistent hydrodynamical Nbody/Tree-SPH simulations of isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). It has enabled us to identify the key physical parameters and mechanisms at the origin of the observed variety in the Local Group dSph properties. The initial total mass (gas + dark matter) of these galaxies is the main driver of their evolution. Star formation (SF) occurs in series of short bursts. In massive systems, the very short intervals between the SF peaks mimic a continuous star formation rate, while less massive systems exhibit well separated SF bursts, as identified observationally. The delay between the SF events is controlled by the gas cooling time dependence on galaxy mass. The observed global scaling relations, luminosity-mass and luminosity-metallicity, are reproduced with low scatter. We take advantage of the unprecedentedly large sample size and data homogeneity of the ESO Large Programme DART, and add to it a few independent studies, to constrain the star formation history of five Milky Way dSphs, Sextans, LeoII, Carina, Sculptor and Fornax. For the first time, [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagrams derived from high-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds of individual stars are confronted with model predictions. We find that the diversity in dSph properties may well result from intrinsic evolution. We note, however, that the presence of gas in the final state of our simulations, of the order of what is observed in dwarf irregulars, calls for removal by external processes.

Out of an original (3.4 Mpc/h)3 cosmological box, a sample of 27 systems are re-simulated from z = 70 to z = 0 using a zoom-in technique. Gas and stellar properties are confronted to the observations in the greatest details: in addition to the galaxy global properties, we investigated the model galaxy velocity dispersion profiles, half-light radii, star formation histories, stellar metallicity distributions, and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios. The formation and sustainability of the metallicity gradients and kinematically distinct stellar populations are also tackled. We show how the properties of six Local Group dwarf galaxies, NGC 6622, Andromeda II, Sculptor, Sextans, Ursa Minor and Draco are reproduced, and how they pertain to three main galaxy build-up modes. Our results indicate that the interaction with a massive central galaxy could be needed for a handful of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies only, the vast majority of the systems and their variety of star formation histories arising naturally from a {$\Lambda$}CDM framework. We find that models fitting well the local Group dwarf galaxies are embedded in dark haloes of mass between 5 {\texttimes} 108 to a few 109 M{$\odot$}, without any missing satellite problem. We confirm the failure of the abundance matching approach at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies. Some of the observed faint however gas-rich galaxies with residual star formation, such as Leo T and Leo P, remain challenging. They point out the need of a better understanding of the UV-background heating.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for studying tracers in gravitational systems where higher moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution are introduced via Virial equations rather than the Jeans equations. Unlike the fourth-order Jeans equations, the fourth-order Virial equations can simply be added to the standard second-order Jeans equation without introducing a new anisotropy parameter {$\beta$}'. We introduce two new global shape parameters {$\zeta$}A and {$\zeta$}B which replace the kurtosis as a more statistically robust measure of the shape of the line-of-sight velocity distribution. We show that in the case of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies these new parameters can significantly reduce the range of density profiles that are otherwise consistent with the observed stellar kinematics (a problem sometimes known as the {$\beta$} degeneracy). Specifically, we find that {$\zeta$}A focuses tightly on a sub-set of solutions where cusped density profiles are degenerate with more concentrated cored dark matter haloes. If the number density of stars {$\nu$}(r) is fixed, then introducing {$\zeta$}B can further reduce the space of solutions by constraining the outer slope of the dark matter density profile. Assuming a Plummer profile for {$\nu$}(r), we recover the surprising result that the dark matter in Sculptor may be cuspy after all, in contrast to the conclusions of other approaches.},

  abstract = {Ghostly stellar haloes are extended haloes of stars composed solely of debris of pre-reionization fossil galaxies and should exist in dwarf galaxies with total masses {$<$}1010 M{$\odot$}. Fossil galaxies are even smaller mass dwarf galaxies that stopped forming stars after the epoch of reionization and have been identified in the Local Group as the ultrafaint dwarf satellites. Using cosmological N-body simulations, we present an empirical model for the shape and mass of ghostly stellar haloes. We compare the model to available observations of stellar haloes in six isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (Leo T, Leo A, IC 10, WLM, IC 1613, NGC 6822) to infer the star formation efficiency in dwarf galaxies at the epoch of reionization. We find an efficiency of star formation in dark matter haloes with masses 106-108 M{$\odot$} at z {\textasciitilde} 7 in rough agreement with independent methods using data on the luminosity function of ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but systematically higher by a factor of 3-5. The systematic uncertainty of our results is still large, mainly because available observations of stellar halo profiles do not extend over a sufficiently large distance from the centre of the host dwarf galaxy. Additional observations, easily within reach of current telescopes, can significantly improve the accuracy of this method and can also be used to constrain the present-day dark matter masses of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Our method is based on a set of observations never used before; hence, it is a new independent test of models of hierarchical galaxy formation.},

Particular attention is given to the quality of the data and to a number of features that users may need to take into account to make the best use of the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 catalogue.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The processing broadly followed the same procedure as for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, but with significant improvements in several aspects of the blue and red photometer (BP and RP) preprocessing and in the photometric calibration process. In particular, the treatment of the BP and RP background has been updated to include a better estimation of the local background, and the detection of crowding effects has been used to exclude affected data from the calibrations. The photometric calibration models have also been updated to account for flux loss over the whole magnitude range. Significant improvements in the modelling and calibration of the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} point and line spread functions have also helped to reduce a number of instrumental effects that were still present in DR2. \emph{Results. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 contains 1.806 billion sources with \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}-band photometry and 1.540 billion sources with \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} photometry. The median uncertainty in the \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}-band photometry, as measured from the standard deviation of the internally calibrated mean photometry for a given source, is 0.2 mmag at magnitude \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} = 10--14, 0.8 mmag at \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 17, and 2.6 mmag at \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 19.

The anisotropy profile for the MW satellite system increases from {$\beta$} {$\sim$} -2 at r {$\sim$} 20 kpc to {$\beta$} {$\sim$} 0.5 at r {$\sim$} 200 kpc, indicating that satellites closer to the Galactic centre have tangentially biased motions while those farther out have radially biased motions. The motions of satellites around APOSTLE host galaxies are nearly isotropic at all radii, while the {$\beta$}(r) profiles for satellite systems in the Auriga suite, whose host galaxies are substantially more massive in baryons than those in APOSTLE, are more consistent with that of the MW satellite system. This shape of the {$\beta$}(r) profile may be attributed to the central stellar disc preferentially destroying satellites on radial orbits, or intrinsic processes from the formation of the MW system.},

  abstract = {In a hierarchically formed Universe, galaxies accrete smaller systems that tidally disrupt as they evolve in the host's potential. We present a complete catalogue of disrupting galaxies accreted onto Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. We classify accretion events as intact satellites, stellar streams, or phase-mixed systems based on automated criteria calibrated to a visually classified sample, and match accretions to their counterparts in haloes re-simulated at higher resolution. Most satellites with a bound progenitor at the present day have lost substantial amounts of stellar mass -- 67 per cent have \$f\_{\textbackslash}text\{bound\} {$<$} 0.97\$ (our threshold to no longer be considered intact), while 53 per cent satisfy a more stringent \$f\_{\textbackslash}text\{bound\} {$<$} 0.8\$. Streams typically outnumber intact systems, contribute a smaller fraction of overall accreted stars, and are substantial contributors at intermediate distances from the host centre (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.1 to \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.7\$R\_{\textbackslash}text\{200m\}\$, or \${\textbackslash}sim\$35 to \${\textbackslash}sim\$250 kpc for the Milky Way). We also identify accretion events that disrupt to form streams around massive intact satellites instead of the main host. Streams are more likely than intact or phase-mixed systems to have experienced preprocessing, suggesting this mechanism is important for setting disruption rates around Milky Way-mass haloes. All of these results are preserved across different simulation resolutions, though we do find some hints that satellites disrupt more readily at lower resolution. The Auriga haloes suggest that disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass galaxies are the norm and that a wealth of tidal features waits to be uncovered in upcoming surveys.},

  abstract = {Using the phat-ELVIS suite of Milky Way-sized halo simulations, we show that subhalo orbital pericentres, rperi, correlate with their dark matter halo structural properties. Specifically, at fixed maximum circular velocity, Vmax, subhaloes with smaller rperi are more concentrated (have smaller rmax values) and have lost more mass, with larger peak circular velocities, Vpeak, prior to infall. These trends provide information that can tighten constraints on the inferred Vmax and Vpeak values for known Milky Way satellites. We illustrate this using published pericentre estimates enabled by Gaia for the nine classical Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellites. The two densest dSph satellites (Draco and Ursa Minor) have relatively small pericentres, and this pushes their inferred rmax and Vmax values lower than they would have been without pericentre information. For Draco, we infer \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} = 23.5 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}pm 3.3\$ km s-1 (compared to \$27.3 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}pm 7.1\$ km s-1 without pericentre information). Such a shift exacerbates the traditional Too Big to Fail problem. Draco's peak circular velocity range prior to infall narrows from Vpeak = 21-51 km s-1 without pericentre information to Vpeak = 25-37 km s-1 with the constraint. Over the full population of classical dwarf spheroidals, we find no correlation between Vpeak and stellar mass today, indicative of a high level of stochasticity in galaxy formation at stellar masses below {\textasciitilde}107 M{$\odot$}. As proper motion measurements for dwarf satellites become more precise, they should enable useful priors on the expected structure and evolution of their host dark matter subhaloes.},

  abstract = {We present the stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 30 elements for five stars located at large radii (3.5-10.7 times the half-light radius) in the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We selected these stars using proper motions, radial velocities, and metallicities, and we confirm them as metal-poor members of Sextans with -3.34 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -2.64 using high-resolution optical spectra collected with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph. Four of the five stars exhibit normal abundances of C (-0.34 {$\leq$} [C/Fe] {$\leq$} + 0.36), mild enhancement of the {$\alpha$} elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] = +0.12 {\textpm} 0.03), and unremarkable abundances of Na, Al, K, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn. We identify three chemical signatures previously unknown among stars in Sextans. One star exhibits large overabundances ([X/Fe] {$>$} +1.2) of C, N, O, Na, Mg, Si, and K, and large deficiencies of heavy elements ([Sr/Fe] = -2.37 {\textpm} 0.25, [Ba/Fe] = -1.45 {\textpm} 0.20, [Eu/Fe] {$<$} + 0.05), establishing it as a member of the class of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no enhancement of neutron-capture elements. Three stars exhibit moderate enhancements of Eu (+0.17 {$\leq$} [Eu/Fe] {$\leq$} + 0.70), and the abundance ratios among 12 neutron-capture elements are indicative of r-process nucleosynthesis. Another star is highly enhanced in Sr relative to heavier elements ([Sr/Ba] = +1.21 {\textpm} 0.25). These chemical signatures can all be attributed to massive, low-metallicity stars or their end states. Our results, the first for stars at large radius in Sextans, demonstrate that these stars were formed in chemically inhomogeneous regions, such as those found in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. *This paper includes data gathered at the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. Other observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.

Draco's star formation shut down long ago, making it a prime candidate for hosting a `pristine' dark matter cusp, unaffected by stellar feedback during galaxy formation. We first test GRAVSPHERE on a suite of tidally stripped mock `Draco'-like dwarfs. We show that we are able to correctly infer the dark matter density profile of both cusped and cored mocks within our 95 per cent confidence intervals. While we obtain only a weak inference on the logarithmic slope of these density profiles, we are able to obtain a robust inference of the amplitude of the inner dark matter density at 150 pc, {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc). We show that, combined with constraints on the density profile at larger radii, this is sufficient to distinguish a {$\Lambda$} Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cusp - that has {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc) {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1.8 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{$\odot$} kpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} - from alternative dark matter models that have lower inner densities. We then apply GRAVSPHERE to the real Draco data. We find that Draco has an inner dark matter density of {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc) = 2.4\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.5\} {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{$\odot$} kpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}, consistent with a {$\Lambda$}CDM cusp. Using a velocity-independent SIDM model, calibrated on {$\Lambda$}SIDM cosmological simulations, we show that Draco's high central density gives an upper bound on the SIDM cross-section of {$\sigma$}/m {$<$} 0.57 cm2 g-1 at 99 per cent confidence. We conclude that the inner density of nearby dwarf galaxies like Draco provides a new and competitive probe of dark matter models.},

  abstract = {Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at low acceleration has been astonishingly powerful at explaining the rotation curve of galaxies and the relation between the baryonic content of the galaxies and their observed circular velocity, known as the baryonic TullyFisher relationship. It is known that MOND fails at explaining the observed velocity dispersion of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) with the justification that UFDs are more prone to tidal disruption in MOND compared to cold dark matter model. We show that (i) the ratio of tidal to internal acceleration in UFDs is extremely low, (ii) there is no correlation between the deviation of UFDs from MONDs prediction as a function of tidal susceptibility, and (iii) recent constraints from Gaia proper motion analysis on the orbital parameters of the UFDs exacerbate the challenge to MOND. In particular, Gaia data indicate that Ursa Major I is experiencing a recent infall into the Milky Ways halo, and its inconsistency with MOND at the 7 level cannot be attributed to being an early infall satellite. Moreover, the new data from Gaia DR2 show Willman I to have the least eccentric orbit of all UFDs, and its deviation from MOND at the 4 level cannot be attributed to a highly eccentric orbit as previously suggested. Finally, given that Tuc III is the only UFD observed to show tidal features, Reticulum II and Segue I are two other UFDs that potentially challenge MOND as they have comparable Galactocentric distances to Tuc III while showing no tidal features.},

  abstract = {We describe the first results from the Outer Limits Survey, an NOAO survey designed to detect, map, and characterize the extended structure of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The survey consists of deep images of 55 0fdg6 {\texttimes} 0fdg6 fields distributed at distances up to 20{$^\circ$} from the Clouds, with 10 fields at larger distances representing controls for contamination by Galactic foreground stars and background galaxies. The field locations probe the outer structure of both the LMC and SMC, as well as exploring areas defined by the Magellanic Stream, the Leading Arm, and the LMC orbit as recently measured from its proper motion. The images were taken with C, M, R, I, and DDO51 filters on the CTIO Blanco 4 m telescope and Mosaic2 camera, with supporting calibration observations taken at the CTIO 0.9 m telescope. The CRI images reach depths below the oldest main-sequence (MS) turnoffs at the distance of the Clouds, thus yielding numerous probes of structure combined with good ability to measure stellar ages and metallicities. The M and DDO51 images allow for discrimination of LMC and SMC giant stars from foreground dwarfs, allowing us to use giants as additional probes of Cloud structure and populations. From photometry of eight fields located at radii of 7{$^\circ$}-19{$^\circ$} north of the LMC bar, we find MS stars associated with the LMC out to 16{$^\circ$} from the LMC center, while the much rarer giants can only be convincingly detected out to 11{$^\circ$}. In one field, designated as a control, we see the unmistakable signature of the Milky Way (MW) globular cluster NGC 1851, which lies several tidal radii away from the field center. The color-magnitude diagrams show that while at 7{$^\circ$} radius LMC populations as young as 500 Myr are present, at radii gsim11{$^\circ$} only the LMC's underlying old metal-poor ([M/H] {\textasciitilde}-1) population remains, demonstrating the existence of a mean population gradient at these radii. Nevertheless, even at extreme large distances, the dominant age is significantly younger than that of the Galactic globular clusters. The MS star counts follow an exponential decline with distance with a scale length of 1.15 kpc, essentially the same scale length as gleaned for the inner LMC disk from prior studies. While we cannot rule out the existence of undetected tidal features elsewhere in the LMC periphery, the detection of an ordered structure to 12 disk scale lengths is unprecedented and adds to the puzzle of the LMC's interaction history with the SMC and the MW. Our results do not rule out the possible existence of an LMC stellar halo, which we show may only begin to dominate over the disk at still larger radii than where we have detected LMC populations.},

  abstract = {Galaxies and their dark-matter haloes have posed several challenges to the dark energy plus cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model. These discrepancies between observations and theory intensify for the lowest-mass (`dwarf') galaxies. {$\Lambda$}CDM predictions for the number, spatial distribution and internal structure of low-mass dark-matter haloes have historically been at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, but this is partially expected, because many predictions modelled only the dark-matter component. Any robust {$\Lambda$}CDM prediction must include, hand in hand, a model for galaxy formation to understand how baryonic matter populates and affects dark-matter haloes. In this Review, we consider the most notable challenges to {$\Lambda$}CDM regarding dwarf galaxies, and we discuss how recent cosmological numerical simulations have pinpointed baryonic solutions to these challenges. We identify remaining tensions, including the diversity of the inner dark-matter content, planes of satellites, stellar morphologies and star-formation quenching. Their resolution, or validation as actual problems with {$\Lambda$}CDM, will probably require both refining of galaxy-formation models and improving numerical accuracy in simulations.},

Here we focus on the evolution of a spherical, dark matter dominated satellite, which is modelled with two stellar components set ab initio to be spatially and kinematically segregated, in a way that resembles the configuration of the metal poor and metal rich stellar populations in several dwarf spheroidals of the Local Group. We find that an important attenuation of the initial differences in the distribution of the two stellar components occurs for orbits with small pericentric radii. This is mainly due to (i) the loss of the gravitational support provided by the dark matter component after tidal stripping takes place and (ii) tides preferentially affect the more extended stellar component, leading to a net decrease in its velocity dispersion as a response for the mass loss, which thus shrinks the kinematical gap. We apply these ideas to the Sculptor and Carina dwarf spheroidals. Differences in their orbits might help to explain why in the former a clear kinematical separation between metal poor and metal rich stars is apparent, while in Carina this segregation is significantly more subtle.},

While the light element abundance variations are very common in globular clusters, they are comparatively rare in the Galactic halo field population. However, little is known regarding the occurrence of the abundance anomalies in other environments such as that of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Consequently, we have investigated the anticorrelation and bimodality of CH- and CN-band strengths, which are markers of the abundance variations in GGCs, in the spectra of red giants in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using spectra at the Na D lines, informed by similar spectra for five GGCs (NGC 288, 1851, 6752, 6809, and 7099), we have also searched for any correlation between CN and Na in the Sculptor red giant sample. Our results indicate that variations analogous to those seen in GGCs are not present in our Sculptor sample. Instead, we find a weak positive correlation between CH and CN and no correlation between Na and CN. We also reveal a deficiency in [Na/Fe] for the Sculptor stars relative to the values in GGCs, a result that is consistent with the previous work for dSph galaxies. The outcomes reinforce the apparent need for a high stellar density environment to produce the light element abundance variations.},

Our deprojections also suggest that a significant fraction of the satellites, {$\sim$}10 per cent, are tidally disrupted remnants.

  abstract = {We propose a cosmological scenario for the formation and evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), satellites of the Milky Way (MW). An improved version of the semi-analytical code GAMETE (GAlaxy Merger Tree and Evolution) is used to follow the dSphs evolution simultaneously with the MW formation, matching the observed properties of both. In this scenario dSph galaxies represent fossil objects virializing at z = 7.2 +/- 0.7 (i.e. in the pre-reionization era z {$>$} zrei = 6) in the MW environment which at that epoch has already been pre-enriched up to [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -3 their dynamical masses are in the narrow range M = (1.6 +/- 0.7) {\texttimes} 108Msolar, although a larger spread might be introduced by a more refined treatment of reionization. Mechanical feedback effects are dramatic in such low-mass objects, causing the complete blow-away of the gas {\textasciitilde}100 Myr after the formation epoch: 99 per cent of the present-day stellar mass, M* = (3 +/- 0.7) {\texttimes} 106Msolar, forms during this evolutionary phase, i.e. their age is {$>$}13 Gyr. Later on, star formation is re-ignited by returned gas from evolved stars and a second blow-away occurs. The cycle continues for about 1 Gyr during which star formation is intermittent. At z = 0 the dSph gas content is Mg = (2.68 +/- 0.97) {\texttimes} 104Msolar. Our results match several observed properties of Sculptor, used as a template of dSphs: (i) the metallicity distribution function; (ii) the colour-magnitude diagram; (iii) the decrement of the stellar [O/Fe] abundance ratio for [Fe/H] {$>$} -1.5 (iv) the dark matter content and the light-to-mass ratio; (v) the HI gas mass content.},

  abstract = {We investigate the success and problems of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in explaining the structural parameters and dynamics of remote Galactic globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Using the MOND value for the mass of the Milky Way, as inferred from the Galactic rotation curve, we derive the tidal radii of Galactic GCs and compare to observed values. Except for Pal 14, the predicted tidal radii of GCs are systematically larger than the observed nominal values. However, the associated uncertainties are so large that tidal radii are consistent on the 1 {$\sigma$} level. We have considered the importance of the Galactic tidal force on the survival of dSphs under MOND. Assuming mass-to-light ratios compatible with a naked stellar population, we found that the present Galactic dSphs preserve their integrity over one Hubble time, except for Sextans, which may survive the tidal interaction only for several Gyr. Mass-to-light ratios as inferred from the internal kinematics of dSph galaxies can be used, but they appear too large to be accounted for only by the stellar population in Willman 1, Coma Berenice, Ursa Minor, Draco, Ursa Major, and possibly Bo{\"o}tes dwarves. Finally, the ability of the Sculptor dwarf to retain the observed population of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is examined. Under the MOND paradigm, we find that the retention fraction in Sculptor is likely not larger than a few percent. Compared to the dark matter scenario, it turns out that MOND makes the retention problem worse. We propose that measurements of the radial velocities of the observed LMXBs in Sculptor could provide a way to distinguish between modified gravities or extended and massive dark matter halos.},

  abstract = {We investigate the ability of basis function expansions to reproduce the evolution of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo, extracted from a cosmological zoom-in simulation. For each snapshot, the density of the halo is reduced to a basis function expansion, with interpolation used to recreate the evolution between snapshots. The angular variation of the halo density is described by spherical harmonics, and the radial variation either by biorthonormal basis functions adapted to handle truncated haloes or by splines. High fidelity orbit reconstructions are attainable using either method with similar computational expense. We quantify how the error in the reconstructed orbits varies with expansion order and snapshot spacing. Despite the many possible biorthonormal expansions, it is hard to beat a conventional Hernquist-Ostriker expansion with a moderate number of terms ({$\greaterequivlnt$}15 radial and {$\greaterequivlnt$}6 angular). As two applications of the developed machinery, we assess the impact of the time-dependence of the potential on (i) the orbits of Milky Way satellites and (ii) planes of satellites as observed in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. Time evolution over the last 5 Gyr introduces an uncertainty in the Milky Way satellites' orbital parameters of \${\textbackslash}sim 15 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{per{\textbackslash}, cent\}\$, comparable to that induced by the observational errors or the uncertainty in the present-day Milky Way potential. On average, planes of satellites grow at similar rates in evolving and time-independent potentials. There can be more, or less, growth in the plane's thickness, if the plane becomes less, or more, aligned with the major or minor axis of the evolving halo.},

  abstract = {We review the available methods for estimating actions, angles and frequencies of orbits in both axisymmetric and triaxial potentials. The methods are separated into two classes. Unless an orbit has been trapped by a resonance, convergent, or iterative, methods are able to recover the actions to arbitrarily high accuracy given sufficient computing time. Faster non-convergent methods rely on the potential being sufficiently close to a separable potential, and the accuracy of the action estimate cannot be improved through further computation. We critically compare the accuracy of the methods and the required computation time for a range of orbits in an axisymmetric multicomponent Galactic potential. We introduce a new method for estimating actions that builds on the adiabatic approximation of Sch{\"o}nrich \& Binney and discuss the accuracy required for the actions, angles and frequencies using suitable distribution functions for the thin and thick discs, the stellar halo and a star stream. We conclude that for studies of the disc and smooth halo component of the Milky Way, the most suitable compromise between speed and accuracy is the St{\"a}ckel Fudge, whilst when studying streams the non-convergent methods do not offer sufficient accuracy and the most suitable method is computing the actions from an orbit integration via a generating function.

  abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group obey a relationship between the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and half-light radius, although there are a number of dwarfs that lie beneath this relation with suppressed velocity dispersion. The most discrepant of these (in the Milky Way) is the `feeble giant' Crater II. Using analytic arguments supported by controlled numerical simulations of tidally stripped flattened two-component dwarf galaxies, we investigate interpretations of Crater II within standard galaxy formation theory. Heavy tidal disruption is necessary to explain the velocity dispersion suppression which is plausible if the proper motion of Crater II is ({$\mu\alpha$}*, {$\mu\delta$}) = (-0.21 {\textpm} 0.09, -0.24 {\textpm} 0.09) mas yr-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the velocity dispersion of tidally disrupted systems is solely a function of the total mass-loss even for weakly embedded and flattened systems. The half-light radius evolution depends more sensitively on orbital phase and the properties of the dark matter profile. The half-light radius of weakly embedded cusped systems rapidly decreases producing some tension with the Crater II observations. This tension is alleviated by cored dark matter profiles, in which the half-light radius can grow after tidal disruption. The evolution of flattened galaxies is characterized by two competing effects: tidal shocking makes the central regions rounder whilst tidal distortion produces a prolate tidally locked outer envelope. After {$\sim$}70 per cent of the central mass is lost, tidal distortion becomes the dominant effect and the shape of the central regions of the galaxy tends to a universal prolate shape irrespective of the initial shape.},

This new phase-space view of our Galaxy demands new tools for comparing observations to simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies in a cosmological context, to test the physics of both dark matter and galaxy formation. We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to generate a suite of synthetic surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project, which feature self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds and thin stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to generate nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by assuming each star particle (of mass 7070 M \textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) represents a single stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust extinction from the simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We provide the complete simulation snapshot at z = 0 for each simulated galaxy. We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades. These synthetic surveys provide a tool for the scientific community to test analysis methods and interpret Gaia data.},

  abstract = {The orbits of satellite galaxies encode rich information about their histories. We investigate the orbital dynamics and histories of satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass host galaxies using the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations, which, as previous works have shown, produce satellite mass functions and spatial distributions that broadly agree with observations. We first examine trends in orbital dynamics at z = 0, including total velocity, specific angular momentum, and specific total energy: the time of infall into the MW-mass halo primarily determines these orbital properties. We then examine orbital histories, focusing on the lookback time of first infall into a host halo and pericentre distances, times, and counts. Roughly 37 per cent of galaxies with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ were 'pre-processed' as a satellite in a lower-mass group, typically \${\textbackslash}approx 2.7{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}\$ before falling into the MW-mass halo. Half of all satellites at z = 0 experienced multiple pericentres about their MW-mass host. Remarkably, for most (67 per cent) of these satellites, their most recent pericentre was not their minimum pericentre: the minimum typically was {\textasciitilde}40 per cent smaller and occurred \${\textbackslash}sim 6{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}\$ earlier. These satellites with growing pericentres appear to have multiple origins: for about half, their specific angular momentum gradually increased over time, while for the other half, most rapidly increased near their first apocentre, suggesting that a combination of a time-dependent MW-mass halo potential and dynamical perturbations in the outer halo caused these satellites' pericentres to grow. Our results highlight the limitations of idealized, static orbit modelling, especially for pericentre histories.},

  abstract = {Understanding the evolution of satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) and M31 requires modelling their orbital histories across cosmic time. Many works that model satellite orbits incorrectly assume or approximate that the host halo gravitational potential is fixed in time and is spherically symmetric or axisymmetric. We rigorously benchmark the accuracy of such models against the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic simulations of MW/M31-mass haloes. When a typical surviving satellite fell in (\$3.4{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!9.7{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{Gyr\}\$ ago), the host halo mass and radius were typically 26-86 per cent of their values today, respectively. Most of this mass growth of the host occurred at small distances, \$r{\textbackslash}lesssim 50{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{kpc\}\$, opposite to dark matter only simulations, which experience almost no growth at small radii. We fit a near-exact axisymmetric gravitational potential to each host at z = 0 and backward integrate the orbits of satellites in this static potential, comparing against the true orbit histories in the simulations. Orbital energy and angular momentum are not well conserved throughout an orbital history, varying by 25 per cent from their current values already \$1.6{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!4.7{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{Gyr\}\$ ago. Most orbital properties are minimally biased, {$\lessequivlnt$}10 per cent, when averaged across the satellite population as a whole. However, for a single satellite, the uncertainties are large: recent orbital properties, like the most recent pericentre distance, typically are {$\approx$}20 per cent uncertain, while earlier events, like the minimum pericentre or the infall time, are {$\approx$}40-80 per cent uncertain. Furthermore, these biases and uncertainties are lower limits, given that we use near-exact host mass profiles at z = 0.},

These systems are selected to be close analogues to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the most massive satellite of the MW. The simulations allow us to address, in a cosmological context, the impact of the Clouds on the MW, including the contribution of Magellanic satellites to the MW satellite population, and the constraints placed on the Galactic potential by the motion of the LMC. We show that LMC-like satellites are twice more common around Local Group-like primaries than around isolated haloes of similar mass; these satellites come from large turnaround radii and are on highly eccentric orbits whose velocities at first pericentre are comparable with the primary's escape velocity. This implies \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm esc\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm MW\} (50\$ kpc) {\textasciitilde} 365 km s-1, a strong constraint on Galactic potential models. LMC analogues contribute about two satellites with \$M\_* 10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, having thus only a mild impact on the luminous satellite population of their hosts. At first pericentre, LMC-associated satellites are close to the LMC in position and velocity, and are distributed along the LMC's orbital plane. Their orbital angular momenta roughly align with the LMC's, but, interestingly, they may appear to 'counter-rotate' the MW in some cases. These criteria refine earlier estimates of the LMC association of MW satellites: only the SMC, Hydrus1, Car3, Hor1, Tuc4, Ret2, and Phoenix2 are compatible with all criteria. Carina, Grus2, Hor2, and Fornax are less probable associates given their large LMC relative velocity.},

We follow the evolution of a halo from the Aquarius project and the formation of its 'maximal' satellite population with the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. This population consists of all subhaloes able to form stars through efficient gas cooling before or after reionization, which effectively selects systems with peak circular velocities exceeding a critical threshold of roughly --20 km s-1. The total number of luminous satellites is sensitive to the assumed redshift of reionization, but the shape of the GALFORM satellite stellar mass function is robust, peaking at the stellar mass ({$\sim$}103) of a halo just above the critical threshold. Subhaloes are prone to artificial disruption in the tidal field of the main halo, with the number of surviving satellites increasing with resolution. Even in the highest resolution simulation (Aq-L1, with particle mass ), a substantial number of satellite subhaloes are disrupted, leaving behind 'orphan' galaxies tracked in GALFORM by the subhalo's most-bound particle before disruption. When orphans are included (and the effects of tidal stripping on stars are neglected), all simulations that adequately resolve the critical threshold yield a converged maximal satellite stellar mass function. Most orphans were accreted early, are found in the central regions of the main halo, and make up roughly half of all satellites in Aq-L1. Taking orphans into account there is no need to populate subhaloes below the critical threshold with satellites to fit the radial distribution of Milky Way satellites, as has been argued in recent work. Our model predicts that orphans dominate the ultrafaint population and that many more satellites with small apocentric radii should be detected in upcoming deep wide-field surveys.},

  abstract = {We derive the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution history (CEH) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). We detect two distinct stellar populations that exist over 6 times half-light radius from its center. The results are obtained by applying a newly developed algorithm to the deep and wide-field photometric dataset taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. The algorithm employs the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing to minimize a \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ value between the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and synthetic CMD generated from the stellar isochrones. The age and metallicity resolutions are set to \$0.5\$ Gyr and \$0.1\$ dex, respectively. The accuracy assessment with mock galaxies shows that it returns the peaks of metallicity distributions and star formation period within 1 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ of input value in the case of a single population. In tests with two populations, two distinct metallicity peaks are identified without an offset from the input values, indicating the robustness of this algorithm. The detected two populations in the UMi dSph have the metallicity peaks of [Fe/H] = \$-2.2\$ and \$-2.5\$; the metal-rich population started its star formation about 1 Gyr later than the metal-poor one. The SFH of both metal-rich and metal-poor populations varies with distance from the center of the UMi dSph, without any age-gradients. These results suggest that the UMi dSph underwent a complex formation process, contrary to the simple formation history of dwarf galaxies previously thought.},

  abstract = {We discover an extended distribution of main-sequence (MS) stars along the minor axis of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). This study is enabled by deep, wide Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam data, reaching photometric uncertainties below 0.1 mag at \$g,i {\textbackslash}sim 26\$ mag. Color-magnitude diagrams along the major and minor axes reveal a clear excess of MS stars beyond the nominal tidal radius along the minor axis. To characterize this structure, we derive radial number density profiles in seven azimuthal directions and fit them with an exponential+power-law function to assess the symmetry of the extended component. The power-law slopes tend to be shallower toward the minor axis, though the symmetry remains inconclusive within 1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ uncertainties. This may indicate that the extended component is preferentially distributed along the minor axis, and could be different from the previously suggested tidal features along the major axis. Comparing with simulations, we find that the fraction of stars beyond five effective radii is consistent with expectations from an intermediate mass ratio merger scenario with a stellar mass ratio around 6:1. While these findings provide new insights into the structural complexity and dynamical history of the UMi dSph, alternative mechanisms such as stellar or supernova feedback have also been proposed for extended stellar halos in dwarfs and cannot be ruled out.},

  abstract = {The Local Group galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests of models of cosmic structure formation. For example, observations of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement with N-body simulations of the `lambda cold dark matter' ({$\Lambda$}CDM) model: there are far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in CDM haloes (the `missing satellites' problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the most massive substructures (the `too-big-to-fail' problem); and the brightest satellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the `planes of satellites' problem). Here we present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of 12 volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local Group (LG) members. Applying the EAGLE code to the LG environment, we find that our simulations match the observed abundance of LG galaxies, including the satellite galaxies of the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the structure of haloes and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individual dwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in their dark matter profiles. Satellite systems form with a range of spatial anisotropies, including one similar to the MWs, confirming that such a configuration is not unexpected in {$\Lambda$}CDM. Finally, based on the observed velocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide estimates of the maximum circular velocity for the haloes of nine MW dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 {$<$} M*/M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 109 M{$\odot$} (M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1010 M{$\odot$} at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 {$\mu$}m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 {$\mu$}m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 {$\mu$}m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 {$\mu$}m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 {$\mu$}m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 {$\mu$}m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 {$\mu$}m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 {$\mu$}m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux {\textasciitilde}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 {$\mu$}m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the formation, evolution and possible longevity of metallicity gradients in simulated dwarf galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the role of potentially orbit-changing processes such as radial stellar migration and dynamical heating in shaping or destroying these gradients. We also consider the influence of the star formation scheme, investigating both the low-density star formation threshold of 0.1\,a.m.u.\,cm-3, which has been in general use in the field, and the much higher threshold of 100\,cm-3, which, together with an extension of the cooling curves below 104~K and increase of the feedback efficiency, has been argued to represent a much more realistic description of star-forming regions.The N-body--SPH models that we use to self-consistently form and evolve dwarf galaxies in isolation show that, in the absence of significant angular momentum, metallicity gradients are gradually built up during the evolution of the dwarf galaxy, by ever more centrally concentrated star formation adding to the overall gradient. Once formed, they are robust and can easily survive in the absence of external disturbances, with their strength hardly declining over several Gyr, and they agree well with observed metallicity gradients of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. The underlying orbital displacement of stars is quite limited in our models, being of the order of only fractions of the half-light radius over time-spans of 5--10~Gyr in all star formation schemes. This is contrary to the strong radial migration found in massive disc galaxies, which is caused by scattering of stars off the corotation resonance of large-scale spiral structures. In the dwarf regime, the stellar body only seems to undergo mild dynamical heating, due to the lack of long-lived spiral structures and/or discs.The density threshold, while having profound influences on the star formation mode of the models, has only an minor influence on the evolution of metallicity gradients. Increasing the threshold 1000-fold causes comparatively stronger dynamical heating of the stellar body due to the increased turbulent gas motions and the scattering of stars off dense gas clouds, but the effect remains very limited in absolute terms.},

A Bayesian algorithm is used to find new candidate members in the extreme outskirts of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy. Precise metallicities and radial velocities (RVs) for two distant stars are measured from their spectra taken with the Gemini South GMOS spectrograph. The radial velocity, proper motion, and metallicity of these targets are consistent with Sculptor membership. As a result, the known boundary of the Sculptor dwarf extends now out to an elliptical distance of {\textasciitilde}10rh (half-light radii), which corresponds to a projected physical distance of {\textasciitilde}3 kpc. As reported in earlier work, the overall distribution of RVs and metallicities indicate the presence of a more spatially and kinematically dispersed metal-poor population that surrounds the more concentrated and colder metal-rich stars. Sculptor's density profile shows a 'kink' in its logarithmic slope at a projected distance of {\textasciitilde}25 arcmin (620 pc), which we interpret as evidence that Galactic tides have helped to populate the distant outskirts of the dwarf. We discuss further ways to test and validate this tidal interpretation for the origin of these distant stars.},

Precise radial velocities ({$\sigma$}RV {$<$} 2 km s-1) and metallicities (\${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{\{{\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]\}\}\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash} 0.2\$ dex) confirm their memberships of UMi. Detailed analysis of the brightest and outermost star (Target 1, at {\textasciitilde}12rh), yields precision chemical abundances for the {$\alpha$} (Mg, Ca, and Ti), odd-Z (Na, K, and Sc), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni, and Cr), and neutron-capture (Ba) elements. With data from the literature and APOGEE data release 17, we find the chemical patterns in UMi are consistent with an outside-in star-formation history that includes yields from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type Ia supernovae. Evidence for a knee in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios near [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -2.1 indicates a low star-formation efficiency similar to that in other dwarf galaxies. Detailed analysis of the surface number density profile shows evidence that UMi's outskirts have been populated by tidal effects, likely as a result of completing multiple orbits around the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {We present nearly self-consistent stellar-halo models of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy associated with the Milky Way galaxy. Such galaxies are dominated by dark matter and have almost no gas in the system. Therefore, they are excellent objects for N-body modeling that takes into account visible and dark matter halo components. In order to model the dark matter halo inferred from the analysis of the measured velocities of Fornax's stars, we constructed several self-consistent quasi-equilibrium models based on two source code sets. One of them (GalactICS Software, NEMO) deals with the self-consistent distribution function modeling that depends on the energy E and vertical component of the angular momentum Lz. The other is included in the AGAMA framework and is based on Schwarzschild's calculation of orbits. It can reproduce the nonspherical self-consistent structure of Fornax as the weighted sum of orbit contributions to the galactic density even though the inferred dark halo parameters come from Jeans analysis, which does not require that any distribution functions be positive. To guess the parameters that make the N-body models close to the visible object, we use the stellar dark matter model of the Fornax galaxy based on hydrodynamic axisymmetric Jeans equations taking into account the velocity anisotropy parameter. Then, we studied the evolution of the models by performing N-body simulations with the falcON code in order to test their stability. The variability of the model parameters over time was obtained during simulations. The AGAMA models show the best agreement of the resulting velocity dispersion profiles with the observed data.},

  abstract = {Spectra for stars located redward of the fiducial red giant branches (RGBs) of the Ursa Minor and Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been obtained with the Hobby-Eberly telescope and the Marcario Low Resolution Spectrometer. From a comparison of our radial velocities with those reported in previous medium-resolution studies, we find an average difference of 10 km s-1 with a standard deviation of 11 km s-1. On the basis of these radial velocities, we confirm the membership of five stars in Ursa Minor and find two others to be nonmembers. One of the confirmed members is a known carbon star that lies redward of the RGB; three others are previously unidentified carbon stars. The fifth star is a red giant that was found previously by Shetrone and coworkers to have [Fe/H]=-1.68+/-0.11 dex. In Draco, we find eight nonmembers, confirm the membership of one known carbon star, and find two new members. One of these stars is a carbon star, while the other shows no evidence for C2 bands or strong atomic bands, although the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is low. Thus, we find no evidence for a population of stars more metal-rich than [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}=-1.45 dex in either of these galaxies. Indeed, our spectroscopic survey suggests that every candidate suspected of having a metallicity in excess of this value based on its position in the color-magnitude diagram is, in actuality, a carbon star. Based on the census of 13 known carbon stars in these two galaxies, we estimate the carbon star specific frequency to be {$\varepsilon$}dSph{\textasciitilde}=2.4{\texttimes}10-5 L-1V,solar, 25-100 times higher than that of Galactic globular clusters. This work is based on observations obtained with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, which is a joint project of the University of Texas at Austin, Pennsylvania State University, Stanford University, Ludwig-Maximillians-Universit{\"a}t M{\"u}nchen, and Georg-August-Universit{\"a}t G{\"o}ttingen.},

  abstract = {Stellar streams are excellent probes of the underlying gravitational potential in which they evolve. In this work, we fit dynamical models to five streams in the Southern Galactic hemisphere, combining observations from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S 5), Gaia EDR3, and the Dark Energy Survey, to measure the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With an ensemble of streams, we find a mass of the LMC ranging from {\textasciitilde}14-19 {\texttimes} 1010 M {$\odot$}, probed over a range of closest approach times and distances. With the most constraining stream (Orphan-Chenab), we measure an LMC mass of \$\{18.8\}\_\{-4.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.5\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , probed at a closest approach time of 310 Myr and a closest approach distance of 25.4 kpc. This mass is compatible with previous measurements, showing that a consistent picture is emerging of the LMC's influence on structures in the Milky Way. Using this sample of streams, we find that the LMC's effect depends on the relative orientation of the stream and LMC at their point of closest approach. To better understand this, we present a simple model based on the impulse approximation and we show that the LMC's effect depends both on the magnitude of the velocity kick imparted to the stream and the direction of this kick.},

In particular, we compare streams identified around 13 Milky Way analogs in the FIRE-2 simulations to streams observed by the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S 5). For an accurate comparison, we produce mock Dark Energy Survey (DES) observations of the FIRE streams and estimate the detectability of their tidal tails and progenitors. The number and stellar mass distributions of detectable stellar streams is consistent between observations and simulations. However, there are discrepancies in the distributions of pericenters and apocenters, with the detectable FIRE streams, on average, forming at larger pericenters (out to {$>$}110 kpc) and surviving only at larger apocenters ({$\greaterequivlnt$}40 kpc) than those observed in the Milky Way. We find that the population of high-stellar-mass dwarf galaxy streams in the Milky Way is incomplete. Interestingly, a large fraction of the FIRE streams would only be detected as intact satellites in DES-like observations, since their tidal tails have too low surface brightness to be detectable. We thus predict a population of yet-undetected tidal tails around Milky Way satellites, as well as a population of fully undetected low-surface-brightness stellar streams, and estimate their detectability with the Rubin Observatory. Finally, we discuss the causes and implications of the discrepancies between the stream populations in FIRE and the Milky Way, and explore future avenues for tests of satellite disruption in cosmological simulations.},

  abstract = {Galaxies like the Milky Way are surrounded by complex populations of satellites at all stages of tidal disruption. In this paper, we present a dynamical study of the disrupting satellite galaxies in the Auriga simulations that are orbiting 28 distinct Milky Way-mass hosts across three resolutions. We find that the satellite galaxy populations are highly disrupted. The majority of satellites that remain fully intact at present day were accreted recently without experiencing more than one pericentre () and have large apocentres () and pericentres (). The remaining satellites have experienced significant tidal disruption and, given full knowledge of the system, would be classified as stellar streams. We find stellar streams in Auriga across the range of pericentres and apocentres of the known Milky Way dwarf galaxy streams and, interestingly, overlapping significantly with the Milky Way intact satellite population. We find no significant change in satellite orbital distributions across resolution. However, we do see substantial halo-to-halo variance of  distributions across host galaxies, as well as a dependence of satellite orbits on host halo mass--systems disrupt at larger pericentres and apocentres in more massive hosts. Our results suggest that either cosmological simulations (including, but not limited to, Auriga) are disrupting satellites far too readily, or that the Milky Way's satellites are more disrupted than current imaging surveys have revealed. Future observing facilities and careful mock observations of these systems will be key to revealing the nature of this apparent discrepancy.},

This analysis is based on high-resolution two-dimensional H{$\alpha$} velocity fields of NGC 4605, NGC 5949, NGC 5963, and NGC 6689 and CO velocity fields of NGC 4605 and NGC 5963. In combination with our previous study of NGC 2976, the full sample of five galaxies contains density profiles that span the range from {$\alpha$}DM = 0 to {$\alpha$}DM = 1.20, where {$\alpha$}DM is the power-law index describing the central density profile. The scatter in {$\alpha$}DM from galaxy to galaxy is 0.44, 3 times as large as in cold dark matter (CDM) simulations, and the mean density profile slope is {$\alpha$}DM = 0.73, shallower than that predicted by the simulations. These results call into question the hypothesis that all galaxies share a universal dark matter density profile. We show that one of the galaxies in our sample, NGC 5963, has a cuspy density profile that closely resembles those seen in CDM simulations, demonstrating that while galaxies with the steep central density cusps predicted by CDM do exist, they are in the minority. In spite of these differences between observations and simulations, the relatively cuspy density profiles we find do not suggest that this problem represents a crisis for CDM. Improving the resolution of the simulations and incorporating additional physics may resolve the remaining discrepancies. We also find that four of the galaxies contain detectable radial motions in the plane of the galaxy. We investigate the hypothesis that these motions are caused by a triaxial dark matter halo and place lower limits on the ellipticity of the orbits in the plane of the disk of 0.043-0.175.},

  abstract = {We present Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy of three recently discovered ultra-faint Milky Way satellites, Grus II, Tucana IV, and Tucana V. We measure systemic velocities of Vhel = 110.0 {\textpm} 0.5 km s-1, Vhel = 15.9-1.7+1.8 km s-1, and Vhel=-36.2-2.2+2.5 km s-1 for the three objects, respectively. Their large relative velocities demonstrate that the satellites are unrelated despite their close physical proximity. We determine a velocity dispersion for Tuc IV of {$\sigma$} = 4.3-1.0+1.7 km s-1, but we cannot resolve the velocity dispersions of the other two systems. For Gru II, we place an upper limit (90\% confidence) on the dispersion of {$\sigma$} {$<$} 1.9 km s-1, and for Tuc V, we do not obtain any useful limits. All three satellites have metallicities below [Fe/H]=-2.1, but none has a detectable metallicity spread. We determine proper motions for each satellite based on Gaia astrometry and compute their orbits around the Milky Way. Gru II is on a tightly bound orbit with a pericenter of 25-7+6 kpc and orbital eccentricity of 0.45-0.05+0.08. Tuc V likely has an apocenter beyond 100 kpc and could be approaching the Milky Way for the first time. The current orbit of Tuc IV is similar to that of Gru II, with a pericenter of 25-8+11 kpc and an eccentricity of 0.36-0.06+0.13. However, a backward integration of the position of Tuc IV demonstrates that it collided with the Large Magellanic Cloud at an impact parameter of 4 kpc {$\sim$}120 Myr ago, deflecting its trajectory and possibly altering its internal kinematics. Based on their sizes, masses, and metallicities, we classify Gru II and Tuc IV as likely dwarf galaxies, but the nature of Tuc V remains uncertain.},

  abstract = {We present Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy of stars in eight of the newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way. We measure the velocity dispersions of Canes Venatici I, Canes Venatici II, Coma Berenices, Hercules, Leo IV, Leo T, Ursa Major I, and Ursa Major II from the velocities of 18-214 stars in each galaxy and find dispersions ranging from 3.3 to 7.6 km s-1. The six galaxies with absolute magnitudes MV{$<$}-4 are highly dark matter dominated, with mass-to-light ratios approaching 1000 Msolar/Lsolar,V. For the fainter galaxies we find tentative evidence for tidal disruption. The measured velocity dispersions of the ultra-faint dwarfs are correlated with their luminosities, indicating that a minimum mass for luminous galactic systems may not yet have been reached. We also measure the metallicities of the observed stars and find that the new dwarfs have mean metallicities of [Fe/H]=-2.0 to -2.3 these galaxies represent some of the most metal-poor stellar systems known. The six brightest of the ultra-faint dwarfs extend the luminosity-metallicity relationship followed by more luminous dwarfs by a factor of {\textasciitilde}30 in luminosity. We detect metallicity spreads of up to 0.5 dex in several objects, suggesting multiple star formation epochs. UMa II and Com, despite their exceptionally low luminosities, have higher metallicities that suggest they may once have been much more massive. Having established the masses of the ultra-faint dwarfs, we re-examine the missing satellite problem. After correcting for the sky coverage of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that the ultra-faint dwarfs substantially alleviate the discrepancy between the predicted and observed numbers of satellites around the Milky Way, but there are still a factor of {\textasciitilde}4 too few dwarf galaxies over a significant range of masses. We show that if galaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos is strongly suppressed after reionization, the simulated circular velocity function of CDM subhalos can be brought into approximate agreement with the observed circular velocity function of Milky Way satellite galaxies.},

  abstract = {The second data release from the Gaia mission (DR2) provides a comprehensive and unprecedented picture of the motions of astronomical sources in the plane of the sky, extending from the solar neighborhood to the outer reaches of the Milky Way. I present proper-motion measurements based on Gaia DR2 for 17 ultra-faint dwarf galaxies within 100 kpc of the Milky Way. I compile the spectroscopically confirmed member stars in each dwarf bright enough for Gaia astrometry from the literature, producing member samples ranging from two stars in Triangulum II to 68 stars in Bo{\"o}tes I. From the spectroscopic member catalogs, I estimate the proper motion of each system. I find good agreement with the proper motions derived by the Gaia collaboration for Bo{\"o}tes I and Leo I. The tangential velocities for 14 of the 17 dwarfs are determined to better than 50 km s-1, more than doubling the sample of such measurements for Milky Way satellite galaxies. The orbital pericenters are well constrained, with a mean value of 38 kpc. Only one satellite, Tucana III, is on an orbit passing within 15 kpc of the Galactic center, suggesting that the remaining ultra-faint dwarfs are unlikely to have experienced severe tidal stripping. As a group, the ultra-faint dwarfs are on high-velocity, eccentric, retrograde trajectories, with nearly all of them having space motions exceeding 370 km s-1. A large majority of the objects are currently close to the pericenters of their orbits. In a low-mass (M vir = 0.9 {\texttimes} 1012 M {$\odot$}) Milky Way potential, eight out of the 17 galaxies lack well-defined apocenters and appear likely to be on their first infall, indicating that the Milky Way mass may be larger than previously estimated or that many of the ultra-faint dwarfs are associated with the Magellanic Clouds. The median eccentricity of the ultra-faint dwarf orbits is 0.79, similar to the values seen in numerical simulations but distinct from the rounder orbits of the more luminous dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {The lowest luminosity (L {$<$} 105L{$\odot$}) Milky Way satellite galaxies represent the extreme lower limit of the galaxy luminosity function. These ultra-faint dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter-dominated, most metal-poor, and least chemically evolved stellar systems known. They therefore provide unique windows into the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on small scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005 and the subsequent observational and theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns, structural properties, stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, as well as what can be learned from each type of measurement. We conclude the following: In most cases, the stellar velocity dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic uncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination. The chemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources of r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star mergers. Even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their stellar components. Determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of observing time with future telescopes.Finally, we offer a look forward at the observations that will be possible with future facilities as the push toward a complete census of the Local Group dwarf galaxy population continues.},

Here we report the detection of an ultra-metal-poor star in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy AS0039. With [Fe/H]LTE = -4.11, it is the most metal-poor star discovered in any external galaxy thus far. Contrary to the majority of Milky Way stars at this metallicity, AS0039 is clearly not enhanced in carbon, with [C/Fe]LTE = -0.75, and A(C) = +3.60, making it the lowest detected carbon abundance in any star to date. Furthermore, it lacks {$\alpha$}-element uniformity, having extremely low [Mg/Ca]NLTE = -0.60 and [Mg/Ti]NLTE = -0.86, in stark contrast with the near solar ratios observed in C-normal stars within the Milky Way halo. The unique abundance pattern indicates that AS0039 formed out of material that was predominantly enriched by a {\textasciitilde}20 M{$\odot$} progenitor star with an unusually high explosion energy E = 10 {\texttimes} 1051 erg. Therefore, star AS0039 represents some of the first observational evidence for zero-metallicity hypernovae and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the diverse nature of Population III stars. * Based on observations made with ESO VLT/X-SHOOTER at the La Silla Paranal observatory under program ID 0102.B-0786.},

  abstract = {The Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is old and metal-poor, making it ideal to study the earliest chemical enrichment in the Local Group. We followed up on the most metal-poor star known in this (or any external) galaxy, AS0039, with high-resolution ESO VLT/UVES spectra. Our new analysis confirmed its low metallicity, [Fe/H]LTE = -3.90 {\textpm} 0.15, and that it is extremely C-poor, with A(C) = + 3.60, which corresponds to [C/Fe]LTE = -0.33 {\textpm} 0.17 (accounting for internal mixing). This adds to the evidence of Sculptor being intrinsically C-poor at low [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -3. However, here we also report a new discovery of a carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP-no) star in Sculptor, DR20080, with no enhancement of Ba, indicative of enrichment by zero-metallicity low-energy supernovae, ESN {$<$} 1 {\texttimes} 1051. This is the first piece of evidence of a dual population of CEMP-no and C-normal stars in Sculptor at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3. The fraction of CEMP-no stars is still low, fCEMPScl = 9-8+11\% at -4 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3, compared to the significantly higher fraction in the Milky Way halo, fCEMPMW {$\approx$} 40\%. To further investigate the early chemical enrichment of Sculptor, we re-derived chemical abundances of light, {$\alpha$}, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements in all Sculptor stars at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -2.8, with available high-resolution spectra. Our results show that at these low [Fe/H], Sculptor is deficient in light elements (e.g. C, Na, Al, Mg) relative to both the Milky Way halo, and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, pointing towards a significant contribution from high-energy supernovae. Furthermore, the abundance pattern of the star AS0039 is best fitted with a zero-metallicity hypernova progenitor, ESN = 10 {\texttimes} 1051, with a mass of M = 20 M{$\odot$}. Our results in Sculptor, at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3, therefore suggest significant enrichment by both very low-energy supernovae and hypernovae, solidifying this galaxy as one of the benchmarks for understanding the energy distribution of the first supernova in the Universe.

  abstract = {We investigate whether the considerable diversity in the satellite populations of nearby Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies is connected with the diversity in their host's merger histories. Analyzing eight nearby galaxies with extensive observations of their satellite populations and stellar halos, we characterize each galaxy's merger history using the metric of its most dominant merger, M {$\star$},Dom, defined as the greater of either its total accreted stellar mass or most massive current satellite. We find an unexpectedly tight relationship between these galaxies' number of M V {$<$} - 9 satellites within 150 kpc (N Sat) and M {$\star$},Dom. This relationship remains even after accounting for differences in galaxy mass. Using the star formation and orbital histories of satellites around the MW and M81, we demonstrate that both likely evolved along the M {$\star$},Dom-N Sat relation during their current dominant mergers with the Large Magellanic Cloud and M82, respectively. We investigate the presence of this relation in galaxy formation models, including using the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations to directly compare to the observations. We find no relation between M {$\star$},Dom and N Sat in FIRE, and a universally large scatter in N Sat with M {$\star$},Dom across simulations-in direct contrast with the tightness of the empirical relation. This acute difference in the observed and predicted scaling relation between two fundamental galaxy properties signals that current simulations do not sufficiently reproduce diverse merger histories and their effects on satellite populations. Explaining the emergence of this relation is therefore essential for obtaining a complete understanding of galaxy formation.},

Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 was uncovered in the deep, wide-field Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and is consistent with an old ({$\tau$} {$>$} 11 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -2.2) stellar population at a heliocentric distance of {\textasciitilde}10 kpc. Despite its being compact (r h = 3 {\textpm} 1 pc) and composed of few stars, we confirm the reality of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 with Keck II/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy and identify 11 radial velocity members, eight of which have full astrometric data from Gaia and are co-moving based on their proper motions. Based on these 11 radial velocity members, we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion of \$\{3.7\}\_\{-1.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\}\$ km s-1 but some caveats preclude this value from being interpreted as a direct indicator of the underlying gravitational potential at this time. Primarily, the exclusion of the largest velocity outlier from the member list drops the velocity dispersion to \$\{1.9\}\_\{-1.1\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\}\$ km s-1, and the subsequent removal of an additional outlier star produces an unresolved velocity dispersion. While the presence of binary stars may be inflating the measurement, the possibility of a significant velocity dispersion makes Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 a high-priority candidate for multi-epoch spectroscopic follow-ups to deduce the true nature of this incredibly faint satellite.},

Based on our calculations, Draco shows a rather wide range of orbital parameters depending on the MW mass and inclusion/exclusion of the LMC, but Sculptor's orbit is very well constrained, with its most recent pericentric approach to the MW being 0.3-0.4 Gyr ago. Our new PMs imply that the orbital trajectories of both Draco and Sculptor are confined within the ``Disk of Satellites,'' better so than implied by earlier PM measurements, and likely rule out the possibility that these two galaxies were accreted together as part of a tightly bound group.},

  abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z {\^a}{$\frac{1}{4}$} 2-3) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

This yields a data set that spans 19 years, has 14 different epochs of observation, and contains 372 unique red giant branch stars, 196 of which have repeat observations. Using this multi-epoch data set, we constrain the binary fraction for Leo II. We generate a suite of Monte Carlo simulations that test different binary fractions using Bayesian analysis and determine that the binary fraction for Leo II ranges from \{0.30\}-0.10+0.09 to \{0.34\}-0.11+0.11, depending on the distributions of binary orbital parameters assumed. This value is smaller than what has been found for the solar neighborhood ({$\sim$}0.4-0.6) but falls within the wide range of values that have been inferred for other dwarf spheroidals (0.14-0.69). The distribution of orbital periods has the greatest impact on the binary fraction results. If the fraction we find in Leo II is present in low-mass ultra-faints, it can artificially inflate the velocity dispersion of those systems and cause them to appear more dark matter rich than in actuality. For a galaxy with an intrinsic dispersion of 1 km s-1 and an observational sample of 100 stars, the dispersion can be increased by a factor of 1.5-2 for Leo II-like binary fractions or by a factor of three for binary fractions on the higher end of what has been seen in other dwarf spheroidals.},

We combine radial velocity measurements from five literature sources taken over the course of {$\sim$}30 years to yield the largest multi-epoch kinematic sample for stars in the dSphs Draco and Ursa Minor. With this data set, we are able to implement an improved version of the Bayesian technique described in Spencer et al. to evaluate the binary fraction of red giant stars in these dwarf galaxies. Assuming Duquennoy \& Mayor period and mass ratio distributions, the binary fractions in Draco and Ursa Minor are \{0.50\}-0.06+0.04 and \{0.78\}-0.08+0.09, respectively. We find that a normal mass ratio distribution is preferred over a flat distribution, and that log-normal period distributions centered on long periods (\{{$\mu$} \}logP\vphantom\{\}{$>$} 3.5) are preferred over distributions centered on short ones. We reanalyzed the binary fractions in Leo II, Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans, and find that there is {$<$}1\% chance that binary fraction is a constant quantity across all seven dwarfs, unless the period distribution varies greatly. This indicates that the binary populations in Milky Way dSphs are not identical in regard to their binary fractions, period distributions, or both. We consider many different properties of the dwarfs (e.g., mass, radius, luminosity, etc.) and find that binary fraction might be larger in dwarfs that formed their stars quickly and/or have high velocity dispersions.},

Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2{\texttimes}107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

We have also simulated a sample of six ultrahighly resolved Milky Way sized haloes, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300000 gravitationally bound subhaloes within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors of up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhaloes with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhaloes within subhaloes, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhaloes than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhaloes than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3 per cent within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1 per cent within the solar circle. The inner density profiles of subhaloes show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fitted by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated haloes are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5kms-1, an extrapolation over some five orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhaloes are more concentrated than field haloes, with a characteristic density that is typically {\textasciitilde}2.6 times larger and increases with decreasing distance from halo centre.},

While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5{\texttimes}10 7 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

  abstract = {We investigate the in-spiralling time-scales of globular clusters (GCs) in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies, due to dynamical friction (DF). We address the problem of these time-scales having been variously estimated in the literature as much shorter than a Hubble time. Using self-consistent two-component (dark matter and stars) models, we explore mechanisms which may yield extended DF time-scales in such systems in order to explain why dwarf galaxies often show GC systems. As a general rule, dark matter and stars both give a comparable contribution to the dynamical drag. By exploring various possibilities for their gravitational make-up, it is shown that these studies help to constrain the parameters of the dark matter haloes in these galaxies, as well as to test alternatives to dark matter. Under the assumption of a dark halo having a central density core with a typical King core radius somewhat larger than the observed stellar core radius, DF time-scales are naturally extended upwards of a Hubble time. Cuspy dark haloes yield time-scales {$\lessequivlnt$}4.5 Gyr, for any dark halo parameters in accordance with observations of stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion in dSph galaxies. We confirm, after a detailed formulation of the DF problem under the alternative hypothesis of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and in the lack of any dark matter, that due to the enhanced dynamical drag of the stars, the DF time-scales in MOND would be extremely short. Taking the well-measured structural parameters of the Fornax dSph and its GC system as a case study, we conclude that requiring DF time-scales comparable to the Hubble time strongly favours dark haloes with a central core.},

  abstract = {Context. It has been proposed that mergers induce starbursts and lead to important morphological changes in galaxies. Most studies so far have focused on large galaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass function is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because of their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. Aims: In this paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they experience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the effects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and kinematical properties. Methods: We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging with a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary the gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while we explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. Results: We find that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long duration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few to 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high gas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial orbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of the systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even in the presence of significant amounts of gas. Conclusions: The simulated systems compare remarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of irregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. This implies that mergers with dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and may thus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population.},

  abstract = {Context. In the context of the current {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological model small dark matter halos are abundant and satellites of dwarf galaxies are expected to be predominantly dark. Since low mass galaxies have smaller baryon fractions, interactions with these satellites may leave particularly dramatic imprints. Aims: We uncover the influence of the most massive of these dark satellites on disky dwarf galaxies and the possible dynamical and morphological transformations that result from these interactions. Methods: We use a suite of carefully set up, controlled simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. The primary dwarf galaxies have solely a stellar disk in the dark matter halo and the secondaries are completely devoid of baryons. We vary the disk mass, halo concentration, initial disk thickness, and inclination of the satellite orbit. Results: The disky dwarf galaxies are heated and disrupted by the minor merger event, more extremely for higher satellite-to-disk-mass ratios, and the morphology and kinematics are significantly altered. Moreover, for less concentrated halos the minor merger can completely destroy the disk leaving a low-luminosity spheroidal-like galaxy instead. Conclusions: We conclude that dwarf galaxies are very susceptible to being disturbed by dark galaxies and that even a minor merger event can significantly disrupt and alter the structure and kinematics of a dwarf galaxy. This process may be seen as a new channel for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.},

  abstract = {Giant stars in Draco reveal a wide range of metal abundance as measured by the strengths of Ca II H and K. These range from abundances intermediate between M3 and M92 to abundances much more metal-poor than M92. Draco is found to contain some stars that are much cooler than the giant-branch tip in M92 while being much more metal-poor than stars in M3. On the average, Draco and Ursa Minor giants reveal a systematic enhancement of the G band of CH relative to globular-cluster stars of comparable metallicities and temperatures; some individual stars, however, show G bands appropriate to their metallicities. The systemic radial velocities of Draco and Ursa Minor are determined to be near -296 and -255 km/s, respectively. One star in the Draco field is determined to be a nonmember. All the other stars observed in the Draco field, among them a UV-bright K giant and a blue suprahorizontal-branch star, together with all the stars observed in Ursa Minor, have velocities consistent with membership. The new radial velocities furnish weak evidence against an internal velocity dispersion as great as 10 km/s in Draco.},

  abstract = {We introduce TiNy Titans (TNT), the first systematic study of star formation and the subsequent processing of the interstellar medium in interacting dwarf galaxies. Here we present the first results from a multiwavelength observational program based on a sample of 104 dwarf galaxy pairs selected from a range of environments within the spectroscopic portion of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and caught in various stages of interaction. The TNT dwarf pairs span mass ratios of M*,1/M*,2 {$<$} 10, projected separations {$<$}50 kpc, and pair member masses of 7 {$<$} log(\{\{M\}*\}/\{\{M\}{$\odot$} \}) {$<$} 9.7. The dwarf-dwarf merger sequence, as defined by TNT at z = 0, demonstrates conclusively and for the first time that the star formation enhancement observed for massive galaxy pairs also extends to the dwarf mass range. Star formation is enhanced in paired dwarfs in otherwise isolated environments by a factor of 2.3 ({\textpm}0.7) at pair separations {$<$}50 kpc relative to unpaired analogs. The enhancement decreases with increasing pair separation and extends out to pair separations as large as 100 kpc. Starbursts, defined by H{$\alpha$} EQW {$>$}100 {\AA}, occur in 20\% of the TNT dwarf pairs, regardless of environment, compared to only 6\%-8\% of the matched unpaired dwarfs. Starbursts can be triggered throughout the merger (i.e., out to large pair separations) and not just approaching coalescence. Despite their enhanced star formation and triggered starbursts, most TNT dwarf pairs have similar gas fractions relative to unpaired dwarfs of the same stellar mass. Thus, there may be significant reservoirs of diffuse, non-star-forming neutral gas surrounding the dwarf pairs, or the gas consumption timescales may be long in the starburst phase. The only TNT dwarf pairs with low gas fractions (fgas 0.4) and the only dwarfs, either paired or unpaired, with H{$\alpha$} EQW {$<$} 2 {\AA} are found near massive galaxy hosts. We conclude that dwarf-dwarf interactions are significant drivers of galaxy evolution at the low-mass end, but ultimately environment is responsible for the quenching of star formation. This preliminary study is a precursor to an ongoing high-resolution H i and optical imaging program to constrain the spatial distribution of star formation and gas throughout the course of the dwarf-dwarf merger sequence.},

Half of these galaxies were discovered in the past few years in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and they are among the least luminous galaxies in the known Universe. A determination of the mass of these galaxies provides a test of galaxy formation at the smallest scales and probes the nature of the dark matter that dominates the mass density of the Universe. Here we use new measurements of the velocities of the stars in these galaxies to show that they are consistent with them having a common mass of about 107 within their central 300parsecs. This result demonstrates that the faintest of the Milky Way satellites are the most dark-matter-dominated galaxies known, and could be a hint of a new scale in galaxy formation or a characteristic scale for the clustering of dark matter.},

  abstract = {The Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy appears to contain two distinct stellar populations of differing metallicity. Several authors have argued that in order for these two populations to reside in the same gravitational potential, the dark matter halo must have a core similar to that observed in the stellar count profile. This would exclude cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles of the kind predicted for halos and subhalos by dark matter-only simulations of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model. We present a new theoretical framework to analyze observations of stellar count and velocity in a self-consistent manner based on separable models, f(E,J)=g(J)h(E), for the distribution function of an equilibrium spherical system. We use this machinery to analyze available photometric and kinematic data for the two stellar populations in Sculptor. We find, contrary to some previous claims, that the data are consistent with populations in equilibrium within an NFW dark matter potential with structural parameters in the range expected in {$\Lambda$}CDM we find no statistical preference for a potential with a core. Our models allow a maximum circular velocity for Sculptor between 20 and 35 km s-1. We discuss why some previous authors came to a different conclusion.},

  abstract = {In the past several years high resolution kinematic data sets from Milky Way satellite galaxies have confirmed earlier indications that these systems are dark matter dominated objects. Further understanding of what these galaxies reveal about cosmology and the small scale structure of dark matter relies in large part on a more detailed interpretation of their internal kinematics. This article discusses a likelihood formalism that extracts important quantities from the kinematic data, including the amplitude of rotation, proper motion, and the mass distribution. In the simplest model the projected error on the rotational amplitude is shown to be \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5 \$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$ stars from either classical or ultra-faint satellites. The galaxy Sculptor is analyzed for the presence of a rotational signal; no significant detection of rotation is found, and given this result limits are derived on the Sculptor proper motion. A criteria for model selection is discussed that determines the parameters required to describe the dark matter halo density profiles and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Applied to four data sets with a wide range of velocities, the likelihood is found to be more sensitive to variations in the slope of the dark matter density profile than variations in the velocity anisotropy. Models with variable radial velocity anisotropy are shown to be preferred relative to those in which this quantity is constant at all radii in the galaxy.},

  abstract = {Apparent exponential surface density profiles are nearly universal in galaxy discs across Hubble types, over a wide mass range, and a diversity of gravitational potential forms. Several processes have been found to produce exponential profiles, including the actions of bars and spirals, and clump scattering, with star scattering a common theme in these. Based on reasonable physical constraints, such as minimal entropy gradients, we propose steady-state distribution functions for disc stars, applicable over a range of gravitational potentials. The resulting surface density profiles are generally a power-law term times a S{\'e}rsic-type exponential. Over a modest range of S{\'e}rsic index values, these profiles are often indistinguishable from Type I exponentials, except at the innermost radii. However, in certain parameter ranges, these steady states can appear as broken, Type II or III profiles. The corresponding velocity dispersion profiles are low-order power laws. A chemical potential associated with scattering can help understand the effects of long-range scattering. The steady profiles are found to persist through constant velocity expansions or contractions in evolving discs. The proposed distributions and profiles are simple and solve the stellar hydrodynamic equations. They may be especially relevant to thick discs that have settled to a steady form via scattering.},

  abstract = {We present a model for the remnants of haloes that have gone through an adiabatic tidal stripping process. We show that this model exactly reproduces the remnant of an NFW halo that is exposed to a slowly increasing isotropic tidal field and approximately for an anisotropic tidal field. The model can be used to predict the asymptotic mass loss limit for orbiting subhaloes, solely as a function of the initial structure of the subhalo and the value of the tidal field at pericentre. Predictions can easily be made for differently concentrated host-haloes with and without baryonic components, which differ most notably in their relation between pericentre radius and tidal field. The model correctly predicts several empirically measured relations such as the 'tidal track' and the 'orbital frequency relation' that was reported by Errani \& Navarro (2021) for the case of an isothermal sphere. Further, we propose applications of the 'structure-tide' degeneracy, which implies that increasing the concentration of a subhalo has exactly the same impact on tidal stripping as reducing the amplitude of the tidal field. Beyond this, we find that simple relations hold for the bound mass, truncation radius, WIMP annihilation luminosity, and tidal ratio of tidally stripped NFW haloes in relation to quantities measured at the radius of maximum circular velocity. Finally, we note that NFW haloes cannot be completely disrupted when exposed adiabatically to tidal fields of arbitrary magnitudes. We provide an open-source implementation of our model and suggest that it can be used to improve predictions of dark matter annihilation.},

  abstract = {We combine the kinematics of 159 globular clusters (GCs) provided by the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) with other observational data to classify the GCs, and to estimate the mass of the Milky Way (MW). We use the age-metallicity relation, integrals of motion, action space and the GC orbits to identify the GCs as either formed in situ (Bulge and Disk) or ex situ (via accretion). We find that 45.3\% have formed in situ, while 38.4\% may be related to known merger events: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, the Helmi streams, the Sequoia galaxy and the Kraken galaxy. We also further identify three new sub-structures associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. The remaining 16.3\% of GCs are unrelated to the known mergers and thought to be from small accretion events. We select 46 GCs which have radii 8.0 {$<$} r {$<$} 37.3 kpc and obtain the anisotropy parameter \${\textbackslash}beta =\{0.315\}\_\{-0.049\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.055\}\$ , which is lower than the recent result using the sample of GCs in Gaia Data Release 2, but still in agreement with it by considering the error bar. By using the same sample, we obtain the MW mass inside the outermost GC as \$M( 37.3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\})=\{0.423\}\_\{-0.02\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.02\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , and the corresponding \$\{M\}\_\{200\}=\{1.11\}\_\{-0.18\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.25\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ . The estimated mass is consistent with the results in many recent studies. We also find that the estimated {$\beta$} and mass depend on the selected sample of GCs. However, it is difficult to determine whether a GC fully traces the potential of the MW.},

  abstract = {Owing to the recent identification of major substructures in our Milky Way (MW), the astronomical community has started to reevaluate the importance of dissolved and existing dwarf galaxies. In this work, we investigate up to 13 elements in 43 giant stars of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy (Scl) using high-signal-to-noise-ratio near-infrared (NIR) APOGEE spectra. Thanks to the strong feature lines in the NIR, we were able to determine high-resolution O, Si, and Al abundances for a large group of sample stars for the first time in Scl. By comparing the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] (i.e., O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) of the stars in Scl, Sagittarius, and the MW, we confirm the general trend that less massive galaxies tend to show lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe]. The low [Al/Fe] ({$\sim$} - 0.5) in Scl demonstrates the value of this ratio as a discriminator with which to identify stars born in dwarf galaxies (from MW field stars). A chemical-evolution model suggests that Scl has a top-light initial mass function (IMF), with a high-mass IMF power index of {$\sim$} - 2.7, and a minimum Type Ia supernovae delay time of {$\sim$}100 Myr. Furthermore, a linear regression analysis indicates a negative radial metallicity gradient and positive radial gradients for [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe], in qualitative agreement with the outside-in formation scenario.},

We study the formation and evolution of UFDs using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. In particular, we show that a major merger of two building block galaxies with 3900 M {$\odot$} and 7500 M {$\odot$} at the cosmic age of 510 Myr results in a system with an extended stellar distribution consistent with the de Vaucouleurs profile. The simulated galaxy has an average stellar metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.7 and features a metallicity gradient. These results closely resemble the properties of a recently discovered UFD, Tucana II, which is extremely metal-poor and has a spatially extended stellar halo with the more distant stars being more metal-poor. Our simulation suggests that the extended stellar halo of Tucana II may have been formed through a past major merger. Future observational searches for spatially extended structures around other UFDs, combined with further theoretical studies, will provide tangible measures of the evolutionary history of the ancient, surviving satellite galaxies.},

RR Lyrae stars can be used to identify the extent of these structures, taking advantage of the minimization of foreground contamination they provide. In this work we use RR Lyrae stars obtained from Gaia DR3, the Dark Energy Survey, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and Pan-STARRS1 to explore the outskirts of 45 ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. We associate the stars with a host galaxy based on their angular separations, magnitudes, and proper motions. We find a total of 120 RR Lyrae stars that belong to 21 different galaxies in our sample. We report seven new RR Lyrae stars in six ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (Hydrus I, Ursa Major I, Ursa Major II, Grus II, Eridanus II, and Tucana II). We found a large number of new possible members in Bootes I and Bootes III as well, but some of them may actually belong to the nearby Sagittarius stream. Adding to our list of 120 RR Lyrae stars the observations of other ultrafaint dwarf galaxies that were beyond the reach of our search, we find that at least 10 of these galaxies have RR Lyrae stars located at distances greater than four times their respective half-light radius, which implies that at least 33\% of the 30 ultrafaint dwarfs with a population of RR Lyrae stars have extended stellar populations.},

  abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery. Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size-luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call 'globular-cluster-like dwarfs' (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2-4), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.},

  abstract = {The spherical Jeans equation is commonly used to infer dark matter distributions in dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way to constrain the nature of dark matter. One of its assumptions is that of dynamical equilibrium while the dwarfs are under the influence of Galactic tides. We carry out tailored simulations of Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor and Ursa Minor and analyse the accuracy of dark matter density profiles and annihilation rates (J-factors) recovered with the Jeans equation, using pyGravSphere. We find that tides do not significantly affect the quality of density profile inference when using a bound sample of stars in the 5 simulated dwarfs; however, pyGravSphere tends to underestimate the inner densities of dwarf galaxies, which, together with tidal mass loss, leads to an inference of flatter density slopes, although all of our dwarfs have cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White haloes. The recovered J-factors are generally underestimated. While the difference with the true J-factor is small, the error bars are often underestimated and must be at least of order 0.1 dex to encompass the true J-factor. We also test the accuracy of the Wolf et al. 2010 mass estimator and find that it can be sensitive to orbital stage and eccentricity. Still, for our sample of dwarf galaxies, the estimates agree with the truth within 10\%. Consistency of our simulated dwarfs with the mass-concentration relation in LambdaCDM requires a light Milky Way, or limited action of tides, which may be in tension with a "tidal stirring" origin of dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {We use the NIHAO (Numerical Investigation of Hundred Astrophysical Objects) cosmological simulations to investigate the effects of baryonic physics on the time evolution of dark matter central density profiles. The sample is made of {$\approx$}70 independent high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and covers a wide mass range: 1010 {$\lessequivlnt$} Mhalo/M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1012, i.e. from dwarfs to L{$\star$}. We confirm previous results on the dependence of the inner dark matter density slope, {$\alpha$}, on the ratio between stellar-to-halo mass, Mstar/Mhalo. We show that this relation holds approximately at all redshifts (with an intrinsic scatter of~{$\sim$}0.18 in {$\alpha$} measured between 1 and 2\,per\,cent of the virial radius). This implies that in practically all haloes the shape of their inner density profile changes quite substantially over cosmic time, as they grow in stellar and total mass. Thus, depending on their final Mstar/Mhalo ratio, haloes can either form and keep a substantial density core (Rcore~{$\sim~$}1~kpc), or form and then destroy the core and recontract the halo, going back to a cuspy profile, which is even steeper than cold-dark-matter predictions for massive galaxies (1012\,M{$\odot$}). We show that results from the NIHAO suite are in good agreement with recent observational measurements of {$\alpha$} in dwarf galaxies. Overall our results suggest that the notion of a universal density profile for dark matter haloes is no longer valid in the presence of galaxy formation.},

We used the ESO Wide Field Imager in conjunction with the Very Large Telescope/FLAMES spectrograph to study the properties of the resolved stellar population of Sculptor out to and beyond the tidal radius. We find that two components are discernible in the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars in our imaging and in the [Fe/H] and vhel distributions for our large sample of spectroscopic measurements. They can be generally described as a ``metal-poor'' component ([Fe/H]{$<$}-1.7) and a ``metal-rich'' component ([Fe/H]{$>$}-1.7). The metal-poor stars are more spatially extended than the metal-rich stars, and they also appear to be kinematically distinct. These results provide insight into the formation processes of small systems in the early universe and the conditions found there. Even this simplest of galaxies appears to have had a surprisingly complex early evolution. Based on FLAMES observations collected at the ESO, proposals 71.B-0641 and 171.B-0588.},

In addition, we provide reliable Ca II triplet metallicities, [Fe/H], for 1339 of these stars. From this combination of new observations (2257 individual spectra) with ESO archival data (2389 spectra), we obtain the largest and most complete sample of vlos and [Fe/H] measurements for individual stars in any dwarf galaxy. Our sample includes VLT/FLAMES LR8 spectra for {$\sim$}55\% of the red giant branch stars at G {$<$} 20 from Gaia DR3, and {$>$} 70\% of the brightest stars, G {$<$} 18.75. Our spectroscopic velocities are combined with Gaia DR3 proper motions and parallax measurements for a new and more precise membership analysis. We look again at the global characteristics of Sculptor, deriving a mean metallicity of {$\langle$}[Fe/H]{$\rangle$} = -1.82 {\textpm} 0.45 and a mean line-of-sight velocity of {$\langle$}vlos{$\rangle$} = + 111.2 {\textpm} 0.25 km s-1. There is a clear metallicity gradient in Sculptor, -0.7deg dex-1, with the most metal-rich population being the most centrally concentrated. Furthermore, the most metal-poor population in Sculptor, [Fe/H]{$<$} - 2.5, appears to show kinematic properties distinct from the rest of the stellar population. Finally, we combine our results with the exquisite Gaia DR3 multi-colour photometry to further investigate the colour-magnitude diagram of the resolved stellar population in Sculptor. Our detailed analysis shows a similar global picture as previous studies, but with much more precise detail, revealing that Sculptor has more complex properties than previously thought. This survey emphasises the role of the stellar spectroscopy technique and this galaxy as a benchmark system for modelling galaxy formation and evolution on small scales.

The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VLT, Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to theories of galaxy formation and evolution.

  abstract = {The stellar abundance pattern of n-capture elements, such as barium, is used as a powerful tool to infer how star formation proceeded in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. It is found that the abundance correlation of barium with iron in stars belonging to dSph galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, i.e., Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor, have a feature similar to the barium-iron correlation in Galactic metal-poor stars. The common feature of these two correlations can be realized by our inhomogeneous chemical evolution model based on the supernova-driven star formation scenario if dSph stars formed from gas with a velocity dispersion of {\textasciitilde}26 km s-1. This velocity dispersion together with the stellar luminosities strongly suggest that dark matter dominated dSph galaxies. The tidal force of the Milky Way links this velocity dispersion with the currently observed value of {$<$}{\textasciitilde}10 km s-1 by stripping the dark matter in dSph galaxies. As a result, the total mass of each dSph galaxy is found to have been originally {\textasciitilde}25 times larger than at present. Our inhomogeneous chemical evolution model succeeds in reproducing the stellar [Fe/H] distribution function observed in Sextans. In this model, supernovae immediately after the end of star formation epoch can expel the remaining gas over the gravitational potential of the dSph galaxy.},

  abstract = {The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the cosmic microwave background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant components. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at {\textasciitilde}7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small, and we advocate a reference frame with respect to the Local Sheet in preference to the Local Group. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km s-1 and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km s-1, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km s-1 in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into account, particularly that of the Local Void, causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. Concerning the motion of {\textasciitilde}260 km s-1 away from the Local Void, given the velocities expected from gravitational instability theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position. The Local Void is extremely large.},

Numerically the largest contributions come from the luminosity-line width correlation for spirals, the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR), and the related fundamental plane relation for E/S0 systems, but over 1000 distances are contributed by methods that provide more accurate individual distances: Cepheid, tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), surface brightness fluctuation, Type Ia supernova, and several miscellaneous but accurate procedures. Our collaboration is making important contributions to two of these inputs: TRGB and TFR. A large body of new distance material is presented. In addition, an effort is made to ensure that all the contributions, both our own and those from the literature, are on the same scale. Overall, the distances are found to be compatible with a Hubble constant H 0 = 74.4 {\textpm} 3.0 km s-1 Mpc-1. The great interest going forward with this data set will be with velocity field studies. Cosmicflows-2 is characterized by a great density and high accuracy of distance measures locally, falling to sparse and coarse sampling extending to z = 0.1.},

  abstract = {We present new fully self-consistent models of the formation and evolution of isolated dwarf galaxies (DGs). We have used the publicly available N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code hydra, to which we have added a set of star formation criteria, and prescriptions for chemical enrichment [taking into account contributions from both Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and Type II supernova (SN II)], supernova feedback, and gas cooling. We extensively tested the soundness of these prescriptions and the numerical convergence of the models. The models follow the evolution of an initially homogeneous gas cloud collapsing in a pre-existing dark matter (DM) halo. These simplified initial conditions are supported by the merger trees of isolated DGs extracted from the milli-Millennium Simulation. The star formation histories (SFHs) of the model galaxies exhibit burst-like behaviour. These bursts are a consequence of the blow-out and subsequent in-fall of gas. The amount of gas that leaves the galaxy for good is found to be small, in absolute numbers, ranging between 3 {\texttimes} 107 and 6 {\texttimes} 107M{$\odot$}. For the least massive models, however, this is over 80 per cent of their initial gas mass. The local fluctuations in gas density are strong enough to trigger starbursts in the massive models, or to inhibit anything more than small residual star formation (SF) for the less massive models. Between these starbursts there can be time intervals of several gigayears.The models' surface brightness profiles are well fitted by S{\'e}rsic profiles and the correlations between the models' S{\'e}rsic parameters and luminosity agree with the observations. We have also compared model predictions for the half-light radius Re, central velocity dispersion {$\sigma$}c, broad-band colour B-v, metallicity [Z/Z{$\odot$}] versus luminosity relations and for the location relative to the fundamental plane with the available data. The properties of the model DGs agree quite well with those of observed DGs. However, the properties of the most massive models deviate from those of observed galaxies. This most likely signals that galaxy mergers are starting to affect the galaxies' SFHs in this mass regime (M{$\greaterequivlnt$} 109M{$\odot$}).We found that a good way to assess the soundness of models is provided by the combination of Re and {$\sigma$}c. The demand that these are reproduced simultaneously places a stringent constraint on the spatial distribution of SF and on the shape and extent of the DM halo relative to that of the stars.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the demographics of dark matter (DM) substructure is of paramount importance for many fields of astrophysics, including gravitational lensing, galaxy evolution, halo occupation modelling, and constraining the nature of DM. Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM substructure is typically modelled using N-body simulations, which reveal that large fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper, we use both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to investigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating and stripping, or numerical (i.e. artificial). We show that, contrary to naive expectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock {$\Delta$}E that exceeds the subhalo's binding energy, {\textbar}Eb{\textbar}, do not undergo disruption, even when {$\Delta$}E/{\textbar}Eb{\textbar} is as large as 100. Along the same line, and contrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter from the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete disruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In addition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters with other subhaloes (`harassment') is negligible compared to the tidal effects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of baryonic processes, the complete physical disruption of CDM substructure is extremely rare and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore must be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with numerical overmerging and conclude that inadequate force softening is the most likely culprit.},

We do this for the LMC by combining our Hubble Space Telescope average proper motion (PM) measurements for stars in 22 fields, with existing line-of-sight (LOS) velocity measurements for 6790 individual stars. We interpret these data with a model of circular rotation in a flat disk. The PM and LOS data paint a consistent picture of the LMC rotation, and their combination yields several new insights. The PM data imply a stellar dynamical center that coincides with the H i dynamical center, and a rotation curve amplitude consistent with that inferred from LOS velocity studies. The implied disk viewing angles agree with the range of values found in the literature, but continue to indicate variations with stellar population and/or radius. Young (red supergiant) stars rotate faster than old (red and asymptotic giant branch) stars due to asymmetric drift. Outside the central region, the circular velocity is approximately flat at Vcirc = 91.7 {\textpm} 18.8 km s-1. This is consistent with the baryonic Tully--Fisher relation and implies an enclosed mass M(8.7 kpc) = (1.7 {\textpm} 0.7) {\texttimes} 1010 M{$\Sun$}. The virial mass is larger, depending on the full extent of the LMC's dark halo. The tidal radius is 22.3 {\textpm} 5.2 kpc (24.{$^\circ$}0 {\textpm} 5.{$^\circ$}6). Combination of the PM and LOS data yields kinematic distance estimates for the LMC, but these are not yet competitive with other methods.},

The global optical colors are red, with median values for the sample of 0.24+/-0.03 in U-B, 0.77+/-0.02 in B-V, and 1.02+/-0.03 in V-I. We recover the well-known color-magnitude relation for cluster galaxies but find no significant difference in dominant stellar population between rotating and nonrotating dwarf elliptical galaxies; the average age of the dominant stellar population is 5-7 Gyr in all 16 galaxies in this sample. Analysis of optical spectra confirm these age estimates and indicate Fe and Mg abundances in the range of 1/20 to one-third of solar, as expected for low-luminosity galaxies. Based on Lick indices and simple stellar population models, the derived [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios are subsolar to solar, indicating a more gradual chemical enrichment history for dE's as compared with giant elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. These observations confirm the marked difference in stellar population and stellar distribution between dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies and further substantiate the need for alternative evolutionary scenarios for the lowest mass cluster galaxies. We argue that it is likely that several different physical mechanisms played a significant role in the production of the Virgo Cluster dE galaxies including in situ formation, infall of dE's that were once part of Local Group analogs, and transformation of dwarf irregular galaxies by the cluster environment. The observations support the hypothesis that a large fraction of the Virgo Cluster dE's are formed by ram pressure stripping of gas from infalling dI's.

We find a clear misalignment between the stream track and the direction of the reflex-corrected proper motions in the leading arm of the stream, which we interpret as a signature of a time-dependent perturbation of the gravitational potential. A likely cause of this perturbation is the recent passage of the most massive Milky Way satellite - the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We develop novel methods for simulating the Sagittarius stream in the presence of the LMC, using specially tailored N-body simulations and a flexible parametrization of the Milky Way halo density profile. We find that while models without the LMC can fit most stream features rather well, they fail to reproduce the misalignment and overestimate the distance to the leading arm apocentre. On the other hand, models with an LMC mass in the range \$(1.3{\textbackslash}pm 0.3){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ rectify these deficiencies. We demonstrate that the stream can not be modelled adequately in a static Milky Way. Instead, our Galaxy is required to lurch toward the massive in-falling Cloud, giving the Sgr stream its peculiar shape and kinematics. By exploring the parameter space of Milky Way potentials, we determine the enclosed mass within 100 kpc to be \$(5.6{\textbackslash}pm 0.4){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ , and the virial mass to be \$(9.0{\textbackslash}pm 1.3){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ , and find tentative evidence for a radially-varying shape and orientation of the Galactic halo.},

We find that the formal uncertainties on parallax and PM are underestimated by \$10\{-\}20\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ in dense central regions even for stars that pass numerous quality filters. We explore the spatial covariance function of systematic errors, and determine a lower limit on the uncertainty of average parallaxes and PM at the level 0.01 mas and 0.025 mas yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ , respectively. Finally, a comparison of mean parallaxes of clusters with distances from various literature sources suggests that the parallaxes for stars with \$G{$>$}13\$ (after applying the zero-point correction suggested by Lindegren et al.) are overestimated by \${\textbackslash}sim 0.01{\textbackslash}pm 0.003\$ mas. Despite these caveats, the quality of Gaia astrometry has been significantly improved in EDR3 and provides valuable insights into the properties of star clusters.},

An emerging picture is that the LMC is a fairly massive companion (10--20\% of the Milky Way mass) and just passed the pericentre of its orbit, likely for the first time. The gravitational perturbation caused by the LMC is manifested at different levels. The most immediate effect is the deflection of orbits of stars, stellar streams, or satellite galaxies passing in the vicinity of the LMC. Less well known but equally important is the displacement (reflex motion) of central regions of the Milky Way about the centre of mass of both galaxies. Since the Milky Way is not a rigid body, this displacement varies with the distance from the LMC, and as a result, the Galaxy is deformed and its outer regions (beyond a few tens kpc) acquire a net velocity with respect to its centre. These phenomena need to be taken into account at the level of precision warranted by current and future observational data, and improvements on the modelling side are also necessary for an adequate interpretation of these data.},

Using a series of tailored N-body simulations, we demonstrate that such orbits are consistent with current observational constraints on the mass distribution and relative velocity of both galaxies. The previous pericentre passage of the LMC could have occurred 5-10 Gyr ago at a distance {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100 kpc, large enough to retain its current population of satellites. The perturbations of the Milky Way halo induced by the LMC look nearly identical to the first-passage scenario, however, the distribution of LMC debris is considerably broader in the second-passage model. We examine the likelihood of current and past association with the Magellanic system for dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, and find that in addition to 10-11 current LMC satellites, it could have brought a further four to six galaxies that have been lost after the first pericentre passage. In particular, four of the classical dwarfs - Carina, Draco, Fornax, and Ursa Minor - each have an {\textasciitilde}50 per cent probability of once belonging to the Magellanic system, thus providing a possible explanation for the 'plane of satellites' conundrum.},

The data are consistent with transverse motion either towards or away from the Galactic plane.

In addition to the annihilation signals from DM particles bound to Sgr, we consider for the first time the annihilation of DM particles bound to the MW that overlap spatially with Sgr. For p-wave models this contribution can enhance the signal by over an order of magnitude, while for d-wave models the enhancement can be over three orders of magnitude. For Sommerfeld and s-wave models, the corresponding emission does not significantly change. For the Sommerfeld model, the Sgr source can be visible above the MW foreground emission, while for s, p and d-wave models, the signal towards Sgr is most likely dominated by foreground MW emission. We interpret our results within the context of the observed gamma-ray emission from Sgr. We find that, given the background emission estimated from this region, the templates from simulations likely have spatial morphology that is too extended to explain the point-like emission that is observed.},

  abstract = {Determination of the mass density profiles of dwarf galaxies (and specifically whether there is a central core or cusp) provides a critical test of both the properties of dark matter (DM) and the physics of cosmological structure formation. The Milky Way nearby classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) provide some of the best dynamical constraints. While large line-of-sight velocity datasets exist (some thousand stars per galaxy), interpretation is hindered by the well-known mass vs. velocity-anisotropy degeneracy of stellar dynamics. This can be resolved with proper motion (PM) measurements that yield 3-D velocity information. This is well beyond the reach of Gaia, given the small velocity dispersions of dSphs and the absence of bright stars. HST is the only observatory that can advance this problem, given its combination of photometric depth, high spatial resolution, and long time baselines. We propose to obtain HST imaging of eight previously imaged fields (four prime plus four parallels) in the nearby Ursa Minor dSph, to obtain high-accuracy PMs for thousands of stars in this galaxy. This unique data set will provide a direct determination of the velocity anisotropy profile. Through detailed dynamical modeling, this will constrain the DM density cusp slope with an uncertainty of only 0.1, allowing us to discriminate at 10-sigma confidence between a core or NFW cusp. The results will give unique constraints on both the nature of DM, and the physical mechanisms that shape DM density profiles in galaxies. The proposed program therefore shows how HST can still be used, after 33 years in orbit, to tackle unanswered fundamental questions in astrophysics.},

This catalog yields the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild oblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ beyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in this series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy due to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical symmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of dark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain the inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity moments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree models from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on) configurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons (\$i = 57.1\$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark matter density slope of \${$\Gamma\_$}\{{\textbackslash}rm dark\} = 0.29{\textasciicircum}\{+0.31\}\_\{-0.41\}\$ within the radial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with \${$\Gamma\_$}\{{\textbackslash}rm dark\} {\textbackslash}leq -1\$ at 99.8\% confidence. This confidence increases for lower inclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The results qualitatively agree with \${$\Lambda\$$}CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios that predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide quantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or particle masses required by these models, respectively.},

Accurate numerical simulations of individual dwarf galaxies are thus still in demand.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}We aim to improve available numerical techniques to simulate individual dwarf galaxies. In particular, we aim to (i) study in detail the coupling between stars and gas in a galaxy, exploiting the so-called stellar hydrodynamical approach; and (ii) study for the first time the chemodynamical evolution of individual galaxies starting from self-consistently calculated initial gas distributions.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We present a novel chemodynamical code for studying the evolution of individual dwarf galaxies. In this code, the dynamics of gas is computed using the usual hydrodynamics equations, while the dynamics of stars is described by the stellar hydrodynamics approach, which solves for the first three moments of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. The feedback from stellar winds and dying stars is followed in detail. In particular, a novel and detailed approach has been developed to trace the aging of various stellar populations, which facilitates an accurate calculation of the stellar feedback depending on the stellar age. The code has been accurately benchmarked, allowing us to provide a recipe for improving the code performance on the Sedov test problem. \emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We build initial equilibrium models of dwarf galaxies that take gas self-gravity into account and present different levels of rotational support. Models with high rotational support (and hence high degrees of flattening) develop prominent bipolar outflows; a newly-born stellar population in these models is preferentially concentrated to the galactic midplane. Models with little rotational support blow away a large fraction of the gas and the resulting stellar distribution is extended and diffuse. Models that start from non-self-gravitating initial equilibrium configurations, evolve at a much slower pace owing to lower initial gas density and hence lower star formation rates. The stellar dynamics turns out to be a crucial aspect of galaxy evolution. If we artificially suppress stellar dynamics, supernova explosions occur in a medium that is heated and diluted by previous activity of stellar winds, thus artificially enhancing stellar feedback.\emph{Conclusions. {$<$}i/{$>$}The stellar hydrodynamics approach presents a promising tool for numerically studying the coupled evolution of gas and stars in dwarf galaxies.}}}}}},

The possible existence of tidal tails in Sculptor and of King limiting radii in Fornax and Carina are used to derive global M/L ratios, without using kinematic data. By matching those M/L ratios to kinematically derived values we are able to constrain the orbital parameters of the three dwarfs. Fornax cannot have M/L smaller than 3 and must be close to its perigalacticon now. The other extreme is Sculptor that needs to be on an orbit with an eccentricity bigger than 0.5 to be able to form tidal tails despite its kinematic M/L.},

As of 2006 November we have used MMFS to collect 6415 high-resolution (R=20,000-25,000) spectra from 5180 stars in four dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans. Spectra sample the range 5140-5180 {\AA}, which includes the prominent magnesium triplet absorption feature. We measure radial velocity (RV) to a median precision of 2.0 km s-1 for stars as faint as V{\textasciitilde}20.5. From the spectra we also are able to measure the strength of iron and magnesium absorption features using spectral indices that correlate with effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical abundance. Measurement of line strength allows us to identify interloping foreground stars independently of velocity and to examine the metallicity distribution among dSph members. Here we present detailed descriptions of MMFS, our target selection and spectroscopic observations, the data reduction procedure, and error analysis. We compare our RV results to previously published measurements for individual stars. In some cases we find evidence for a mild, velocity-dependent offset between the RVs that we measure using the magnesium triplet and previously published RV measurements derived from the infrared calcium triplet. In companion papers we will present the complete data sets and kinematic analyses of these new observations. This paper includes data obtained with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

  abstract = {We develop an algorithm for estimating parameters of a distribution sampled with contamination. We employ a statistical technique known as "expectation maximization" (EM). Given models for both member and contaminant populations, the EM algorithm iteratively evaluates the membership probability of each discrete data point, then uses those probabilities to update parameter estimates for member and contaminant distributions. The EM approach has wide applicability to the analysis of astronomical data. Here we tailor an EM algorithm to operate on spectroscopic samples obtained with the Michigan-MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) as part of our Magellan survey of stellar radial velocities in nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. These samples, to be presented in a companion paper, contain discrete measurements of line-of-sight velocity, projected position, and pseudo-equivalent width of the Mg-triplet feature, for {\textasciitilde}1000-2500 stars per dSph, including some fraction of contamination by foreground Milky Way stars. The EM algorithm uses all of the available data to quantify dSph and contaminant distributions. For distributions (e.g., velocity and Mg-index of dSph stars) assumed to be Gaussian, the EM algorithm returns maximum-likelihood estimates of the mean and variance, as well as the probability that each star is a dSph member. These probabilities can serve as weights in subsequent analyses. Applied to our MMFS data, the EM algorithm identifies more than 5000 stars as probable dSph members. We test the performance of the EM algorithm on simulated data sets that represent a range of sample size, level of contamination, and amount of overlap between dSph and contaminant velocity distributions. The simulations establish that for samples ranging from large (N {\textasciitilde} 3000, characteristic of the MMFS samples) to small (N {\textasciitilde} 30), resembling new samples for extremely faint dSphs), the EM algorithm distinguishes members from contaminants and returns accurate parameter estimates much more reliably than conventional methods of contaminant removal (e.g., sigma clipping).},

  abstract = {We apply the Jeans equation to estimate masses for eight of the brightest dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. For Fornax, the dSph with the largest kinematic data set, we obtain a model-independent constraint on the maximum circular velocity, V max = 20+4 -3 km s-1. Although we obtain only lower limits of V max {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 10 km s-1 for the remaining dSphs, we find that in all cases the enclosed mass at the projected half-light radius is well constrained and robust to a wide range of halo models and velocity anisotropies. We derive a simple analytic formula that estimates M(r half) accurately with respect to results from the full Jeans analysis. Applying this formula to the entire population of Local Group dSphs with published kinematic data, we demonstrate a correlation such that M(r half) vprop r 1.4{\textpm}0.4 half, or in terms of the mean density interior to the half-light radius, lang{$\rho$}rang vprop r -1.6{\textpm}0.4 half. This relation is driven by the fact that the dSph data exhibit a correlation between global velocity dispersion and half-light radius. We argue that tidal forces are unlikely to have introduced this relation, but tides may have increased the scatter and/or altered the slope. While the data are well described by mass profiles ranging over a factor of lsim2 in normalization (V max {\textasciitilde} 10-20 km s-1), we consider the hypothesis that all dSphs are embedded within a "universal" dark matter halo. We show that in addition to the power law M vprop r 1.4, viable candidates include a cuspy "Navarro-Frenk-White" halo with V max {\textasciitilde} 15 km s-1 and scale radius r 0 {\textasciitilde} 800 pc, as well as a cored halo with V max {\textasciitilde} 13 km s-1 and r 0 {\textasciitilde} 150 pc. Finally, assuming that their measured velocity dispersions accurately reflect their masses, the smallest dSphs now allow us to resolve dSph densities at radii as small as a few tens of pc. At these small scales, we find mean densities as large as lang{$\rho$}rang {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 5 M sun pc-3 (lsim200 GeV cm-3). This paper presents data gathered with the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, and the MMT Observatory at Mt. Hopkins, AZ, USA.},

  abstract = {We introduce a method for measuring the slopes of mass profiles within dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies directly from stellar spectroscopic data and without adopting a dark matter halo model. Our method combines two recent results: (1) spherically symmetric, equilibrium Jeans models imply that the product of half-light radius and (squared) stellar velocity dispersion provides an estimate of the mass enclosed within the half-light radius of a dSph stellar component, and (2) some dSphs have chemodynamically distinct stellar subcomponents that independently trace the same gravitational potential. We devise a statistical method that uses measurements of stellar positions, velocities, and spectral indices to distinguish two dSph stellar subcomponents and to estimate their individual half-light radii and velocity dispersions. For a dSph with two detected stellar subcomponents, we obtain estimates of masses enclosed at two discrete points in the same mass profile, immediately defining a slope. Applied to published spectroscopic data, our method distinguishes stellar subcomponents in the Fornax and Sculptor dSphs, for which we measure slopes {$\Gamma$} {$\equiv$} {$\Delta$}log M/{$\Delta$}log r = 2.61+0.43 -0.37 and {$\Gamma$} = 2.95+0.51 -0.39, respectively. These values are consistent with "cores" of constant density within the central few hundred parsecs of each galaxy and rule out "cuspy" Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles (dlog M/dlog r {$<$}= 2 at all radii) with a significance {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 96\% and {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 99\%, respectively. Tests with synthetic data indicate that our method tends systematically to overestimate the mass of the inner stellar subcomponent to a greater degree than that of the outer stellar subcomponent, and therefore to underestimate the slope {$\Gamma$} (implying that the stated NFW exclusion levels are conservative).},

  abstract = {We use the APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment) cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to examine the effects of tidal stripping on cold dark matter subhaloes that host three of the most luminous Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies: Fornax, Sculptor and Leo I. We identify simulated satellites that match the observed spatial and kinematic distributions of stars in these galaxies, and track their evolution after infall. We find {$\sim$}30 per cent of subhaloes hosting satellites with present-day stellar mass 106-108 M{$\odot$} experience {$>$}20 per cent stellar mass-loss after infall. Fornax analogues have earlier infall times compared to Sculptor and Leo I analogues. Star formation in Fornax analogues continues for {$\sim$}3-6 Gyr after infall, whereas Sculptor and Leo I analogues stop forming stars {$<$}2-3 Gyr after infall. Fornax analogues typically show more significant stellar mass-loss and exhibit stellar tidal tails, whereas Sculptor and Leo I analogues, which are more deeply embedded in their host dark matter haloes at infall, do not show substantial mass-loss due to tides. When additionally comparing the orbital motion of the host subaloes to the measured proper motion of Fornax, we find the matching more difficult; host subhaloes tend to have pericentres smaller than that measured for Fornax itself. From the kinematic and orbital data, we estimate that Fornax has lost 10-20 per cent of its infall stellar mass. Our best estimate for the surface brightness of a stellar tidal stream associated with Fornax is {$\Sigma$} {$\sim$} 32.6 mag arcsec-2, which may be detectable with deep imaging surveys such as DES and LSST.},

  abstract = {Using deep wide-field photometry 3 yr data (Y3) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we present a panoramic study of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The data presented here---a small subset of the full survey---uniformly cover a region of 25 deg2 centered on the galaxy to a depth of g {$\sim$} 23.5. We use these data to study the structural properties of Fornax, overall stellar population, and its member stars in different evolutionary phases. We also search for possible signs of tidal disturbance. Fornax is found to be significantly more spatially extended than what early studies suggested. No statistically significant distortions or signs of tidal disturbances were found down to a surface brightness limit of {$\sim$}32.1 mag arcsec-2. However, there are hints of shell-like features located {$\sim$}20--40- from the center of Fornax that may be stellar debris from past merger events. We also find that intermediate-age and young main-sequence populations show different orientation at the galaxy center and have many substructures. The deep DES Y3 data allow us to characterize the age of those young stellar substructures with great accuracy, both those previously known and those newly identified as possible overdensities in this work, on the basis of their color-magnitude diagram morphology. We find that the youngest overdensities are all found on the eastern side of Fornax, where the Fornax field population itself is slightly younger than in the west. In summary, the high-quality DES Y3 data reveal that Fornax has many rich structures and provide insights into its complex formation history.},

We group the various studies into seven broad classes according to their modeling approaches. The classes include: i) estimating Galactic escape velocity using high velocity objects; ii) measuring the rotation curve through terminal and circular velocities; iii) modeling halo stars, globular clusters and satellite galaxies with the spherical Jeans equation and iv) with phase-space distribution functions; v) simulating and modeling the dynamics of stellar streams and their progenitors; vi) modeling the motion of the Milky Way, M31 and other distant satellites under the framework of Local Group timing argument; and vii) measurements made by linking the brightest Galactic satellites to their counterparts in simulations. For each class of methods, we introduce their theoretical and observational background, the method itself, the sample of available tracer objects, model assumptions, uncertainties, limits and the corresponding measurements that have been achieved in the past. Both the measured total masses within the radial range probed by tracer objects and the extrapolated virial masses are discussed and quoted. We also discuss the role of modern numerical simulations in terms of helping to validate model assumptions, understanding systematic uncertainties and calibrating the measurements. While measurements in the last two decades show a factor of two scatters, recent measurements using Gaia DR2 data are approaching a higher precision. We end with a detailed discussion of future developments in the field, especially as the size and quality of the observational data will increase tremendously with current and future surveys. In such cases, the systematic uncertainties will be dominant and thus will necessitate a much more rigorous testing and characterization of the various mass determination methods.},

  abstract = {Wide-area deep imaging surveys have discovered large numbers of extremely low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies, which challenge galaxy formation theory and, potentially, offer new constraints on the nature of dark matter. Here we discuss one as-yet-unexplored formation mechanism that may account for a fraction of LSB dwarfs. We call this the "ghost galaxy" scenario. In this scenario, inefficient radiative cooling prevents star formation in the "main branch" of the merger tree of a low-mass dark matter halo, such that almost all its stellar mass is acquired through mergers with less massive (but nevertheless star-forming) progenitors. Present-day systems formed in this way would be "ghostly" isolated stellar halos with no central galaxy. We use merger trees based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and the Copernicus Complexio cosmological N-body simulation to demonstrate that mass assembly histories of this kind can occur for low-mass halos in {$\Lambda$}CDM, but they are rare. They are most probable in isolated halos of present-day mass {\textasciitilde}4 {\texttimes} 109 M {$\odot$}, occurring for {\textasciitilde}5\% of all halos of that mass under standard assumptions about the timing and effect of cosmic reionization. The stellar masses of star-forming progenitors in these systems are highly uncertain; abundance-matching arguments imply a bimodal present-day mass function having a brighter population (median M {$\star$} {\textasciitilde} 3 {\texttimes} 106 M {$\odot$}) consistent with the tail of the observed luminosity function of ultradiffuse galaxies. This suggests that observable analogs of these systems may await discovery. We find that a stronger ionizing background (globally or locally) produces brighter and more extended ghost galaxies.},

  abstract = {The discovery of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in globular clusters (GCs) raises the possibility of long-term retention of BHs within GCs. These BHs influence various astrophysical processes, including merger-driven gravitational waves and the formation of X-ray binaries. They also impact cluster dynamics by heating and creating low-density cores. Previous N-body models suggested that Palomar 5, a low-density GC with long tidal tails, may contain more than 100 BHs. To test this scenario, we conduct N-body simulations of Palomar 5 with primordial binaries to explore the influence of BHs on binary populations and the stellar mass function. Our results show that primordial binaries have minimal effect on the long-term evolution. In dense clusters with BHs, the fraction of wide binaries with periods {$>$}105 d decreases, and the disruption rate is independent of the initial period distribution. Multi-epoch spectroscopic observations of line-of-sight velocity changes can detect most bright binaries with periods below 104 d, significantly improving velocity dispersion measurements. Four BH-MS binaries in the model with BHs suggests their possible detection through the same observation method. Including primordial binaries leads to a flatter inferred mass function because of spatially unresolved binaries, leading to a better match of the observations than models without binaries, particularly in Palomar 5's inner region. Future observations should focus on the cluster velocity dispersion and binaries with periods of 104-105 d in Palomar 5's inner and tail regions to constrain BH existence.},

These dwarfs are expected to have fallen into the Galactic halo less than 3 Gyr ago, and will therefore have undergone no more than one full orbit. Here, we have performed hydrodynamical simulations of this process, assuming that their progenitors are gas-rich, rotation-supported dwarfs. We follow their transformation through interactions with the hot corona and gravitational field of the galaxy. Our dedicated simulations reproduce the structural properties of three dwarf galaxies: Sculptor, Antlia II, and with somewhat a lower accuracy, Crater II. This includes reproducing their large velocity dispersions, which are caused by ram-pressure stripping and Galactic tidal shocks. Differences between dwarfs can be interpreted as due to different orbital paths, as well as to different initial conditions for their progenitor gas and stellar contents. However, we failed to suppress in a single orbit the rotational support of our Sculptor analogue if it is fully dark matter dominated. In addition, we have found that classical dwarf galaxies like Sculptor may have stellar cores sufficiently dense to survive the pericentre passage through adiabatic contraction. On the contrary, our Antlia II and Crater II analogues are tidally stripped, explaining their large sizes, extremely low surface brightnesses, and velocity dispersion. This modelling explains differences between dwarf galaxies by reproducing them as being at different stages of out-of-equilibrium stellar systems.},

  abstract = {The disk components of galaxies generally show an exponential profile extending over several scale lengths, both in mass and star formation rate, but the physical origin is not well understood. We explore a physical model in which the galactic gas disk is viewed as a "modified accretion disk" in which coplanar gas inflow, driven by viscous stresses in the disk, provides the fuel for star formation, which progressively removes gas as it flows inward. We show that magnetic stresses from magneto-rotational instability are the most plausible source of the required viscosity, and construct a simple physical model to explore this. A key feature is to link the magnetic field strength to the local star formation surface density, \$\{B\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{tot\}\}{\textbackslash}propto \{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}Sigma \}\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SFR\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$ . This provides a feedback loop between star formation and the flow of gas. We find that the model naturally produces stable steady-state exponential disks, as long as {$\alpha$} {\textasciitilde} 0.15, the value indicated from spatially resolved observations of nearby galaxies. The disk scale length h R is set by the rate at which the disk is fed, by the normalization of the B tot-{$\Sigma$}SFR relation and by the circular velocity of the halo. The angular momentum distribution of the gas and stars within the disk is a consequence of the transfer of angular momentum that is inherent to the operation of an accretion disk, rather than the initial angular momentum of the inflowing material. We suggest that magnetic stresses likely play a major role in establishing the stable exponential form of galactic disks.},

  abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy-halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 1012M{$\odot$}, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

  abstract = {Stellar streams -- formed from tidally stripped globular clusters or dwarf galaxies -- are sensitive tracers of a galaxy's accretion history and gravitational potential. While numerous streams are known in the Milky Way (MW), the formation and evolution of stellar streams have been primarily studied in isolated settings. The impact of subsequent galaxy interactions on stellar streams remains largely unexplored. Understanding merger-induced effects is however, crucial given the accretion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) onto the MW, and the fact that for example M31 and Cen A have experienced recent mergers. We analyze the detailed evolution of 1024 stellar streams during a complete MW--LMC-like merger, systematically varying initial stream properties and considering various orbits for the infalling perturber. We find that an MW--LMC mass-ratio merger significantly alters stellar stream properties, including energy, angular momentum, orbit, and morphology. Some streams exhibit dramatic morphological changes or develop complex substructures, while others see substantial shifts in energy and/or angular momentum, or re-orient their orbital plane. Interestingly, strong morphological alterations do not necessarily correlate with large changes in energy or orbit. A few streams split apart with parts moving to different orbits, appearing disconnected in position and kinematics despite their common origin. Strong effects correlate with close encounters between stream particles and the infalling perturber at various times during the merger. Our findings highlight the considerable impact of significant accretion events on the properties of stellar streams, and the challenge to recover the initial orbits of streams from their appearance at the present-day. Visualizations of the detailed evolution of all 1024 stellar streams are available at https://dancingstreamsinmerginghalos.github.io.},

  abstract = {The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been remarkably successful in explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it has faced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regions of dark matter halos and the properties of the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy satellites. We review the current observational and theoretical status of these "small-scale controversies." Cosmological simulations that incorporate only gravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and central densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics. The solution could lie in baryonic physics: Recent numerical simulations and analytical models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to efficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive galaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star formation efficiency could explain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host visible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the lowest mass galaxies, where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the small-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark sector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter self-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good agreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational lensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo provide evidence for an abundant population of low-mass subhalos in accord with CDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the next few years.},

  abstract = {We present uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 60 nearby (D {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 4 Mpc) dwarf galaxies based on color-magnitude diagrams of resolved stellar populations from images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and analyzed as part of the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury program (ANGST). This volume-limited sample contains 12 dwarf spheroidal (dSph)/dwarf elliptical (dE), 5 dwarf spiral, 28 dwarf irregular (dI), 12 dSph/dI (transition), and 3 tidal dwarf galaxies. The sample spans a range of {\textasciitilde}10 mag in MB and covers a wide range of environments, from highly interacting to truly isolated. From the best-fit SFHs, we find three significant results for dwarf galaxies in the ANGST volume: (1) the majority of dwarf galaxies formed the bulk of their mass prior to z {\textasciitilde} 1, regardless of current morphological type; (2) the mean SFHs of dIs, transition dwarf galaxies (dTrans), and dSphs are similar over most of cosmic time, and only begin to diverge a few Gyr ago, with the clearest differences between the three appearing during the most recent 1 Gyr and (3) the SFHs are complex and the mean values are inconsistent with simple SFH models, e.g., single bursts, constant star formation rates (SFRs), or smooth, exponentially declining SFRs. The mean SFHs show clear divergence from the cosmic SFH at z {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 0.7, which could be evidence that low-mass systems have experienced delayed star formation relative to more massive galaxies. The sample shows a strong density-morphology relationship, such that the dSphs in the sample are less isolated than the dIs. We find that the transition from a gas-rich to gas-poor galaxy cannot be solely due to internal mechanisms such as stellar feedback, and instead is likely the result of external mechanisms, e.g., ram pressure and tidal stripping and tidal forces. In terms of their environments, SFHs, and gas fractions, the majority of the dTrans appear to be low-mass dIs that simply lack H{$\alpha$} emission, similar to Local Group (LG) dTrans DDO 210. However, a handful of dTrans have remarkably low gas fractions, suggesting that they have nearly exhausted their gas supply, analogous to LG dTrans such as Phoenix. Finally, we have also included extensive exploration of uncertainties in the SFH recovery method, including the optimization of time resolution, the effects of photometric depth, and impact of systematic uncertainties due to the limitations in current stellar evolution models.

We demonstrate that accurate SFHs can be recovered from CMDs that do not reach the oldest main sequence turn-off (MSTO), but emphasize that the oldest MSTO is critical for precisely constraining the earliest epochs of star formation. We find that: (1) the average lifetime SFHs of dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) can be approximated by an exponentially declining SFH with {$\tau$} {\textasciitilde} 5 Gyr (2) lower luminosity dSphs are less likely to have extended SFHs than more luminous dSphs; (3) the average SFHs of dwarf irregulars (dIrrs), transition dwarfs, and dwarf ellipticals can be approximated by the combination of an exponentially declining SFH ({$\tau$} {\textasciitilde} 3-4 Gyr) for lookback ages {$>$}10-12 Gyr ago and a constant SFH thereafter; (4) the observed fraction of stellar mass formed prior to z = 2 ranges considerably (80\% for galaxies with M {$<$} 105 M {$\odot$} to 30\% for galaxies with M {$>$} 107 M {$\odot$}) and is largely explained by environment; (5) the distinction between "ultra-faint" and "classical" dSphs is arbitrary; (6) LG dIrrs formed a significantly higher fraction of stellar mass prior to z = 2 than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies from Leitner and the SFHs from the abundance matching models of Behroozi et al.

  abstract = {We explore the spatial distribution of stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy over an area of 7.82 deg2, including coverage of the central region but extending mostly south and east of the dSph core. Two methods are used to identify stars that are most likely associated with the dSph, and these filtered samples of stars are used to map its spatial structure. First, following the method of previous contributions in this series, we utilize Washington M, T2+DDO51 photometry to identify red giant branch (RGB) star candidates with approximately the same distance and metallicity as the Sculptor dSph. Second, a prominent blue horizontal branch (BHB) population provides a fairly populous and pure sample of Sculptor stars having broadband colors unlike the bulk of the Galactic field star population. A spectroscopically observed subset of Sculptor candidate stars (147 total stars: {\textasciitilde}5\% of all Sculptor candidates and {\textasciitilde}10\% of Sculptor giant candidates) yields a systemic heliocentric velocity for the system of vhel=110.43+/-0.79 km s-1, in good agreement with previous studies. We also find a global velocity dispersion of {$\sigma$}v=8.8+/-0.6 km s-1, with slight indications of a rise in the velocity dispersion past {\textasciitilde}0.4rlim. These spectra also provide a check on the reliability of our candidate Sculptor giant sample to M{\textasciitilde}19 94\% of the photometrically selected Sculptor giant star candidates with follow-up spectroscopy are found to be kinematically associated with Sculptor, while 4 out of 10 stars outside of our Sculptor giant star selection criteria that we tested spectroscopically appear to be velocity members of Sculptor. These percentages are in agreement with results for an additional 22 Sculptor field stars with radial velocities in the literature. All available velocities show that our methodology for picking Sculptor giants is both reliable and conservative. Thus, these giant star samples should provide a reliable means to explore the structure of the Sculptor dSph. Nevertheless, considerable care has been taken to assess the level of background contamination in our photometric sample to ensure an accurately derived density profile of the Sculptor dSph to large radii. Multiple background assessments verify that we detect a considerable stellar density of Sculptor stars to the limits of our main survey area for both the RGB and BHB candidate samples. While we find that a King profile of limiting radius rlim=79.6 arcmin fits the density profile of Sculptor well to {\textasciitilde}60', beyond this, we identify a ``break'' in the profile and a clearly detected population of Sculptor stars following a {$\Sigma$}{\textasciitilde}r-2 decline to more than 2rlim. This break population must signify either the presence of an extremely broad distribution of bound ``halo stars'' around the Sculptor dSph or the presence of unbound tidal debris. If the latter is true, we determine a fractional mass-loss rate of approximately 0.042 Gyr-1 for the Sculptor dSph. Additional support for the notion that there is tidal disruption comes from the two-dimensional distribution of our Sculptor candidate stars; both the RGB and BHB samples show increasingly elongated isodensity contours with radius that point to an apparent stretching reminiscent of what is seen in models of disrupting satellite galaxies. Finally, we find that RGB stars that are more likely to be metal-poor (based on their color and magnitude) are significantly less centrally concentrated and therefore constitute the primary contributing stellar population to the likely tidally stripped parts of the dSph.},

Every halo with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{8.6\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ is populated by a resolved stellar galaxy, suggesting very low-mass dwarfs may be ubiquitous in the field. Our ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs; \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}{\textbackslash}lt 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) have their star formation (SF) truncated early (z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2), likely by reionization, while classical dwarfs (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}{\textbackslash}gt 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) continue forming stars to z \&lt; 0.5.

The lowest mass UFDs are below surface brightness limits of current surveys but are potentially visible in next-generation surveys (e.g. LSST). The stellar metallicities are lower than in LG dwarfs; this may reflect pre-enrichment of the LG by the massive hosts or Pop-III stars. Consistency with lower resolution studies implies that our simulations are numerically robust (for a given physical model).},

  abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

A comparison of the results shows that the decay rate depends on the global response of the parent galaxy. It is artificially enhanced by fixing the center of the parent, and it is suppressed by neglecting the self-gravity of the response. Chandrasekhar's local dynamical friction formula cannot, therefore, be a complete description of the underlying physics, although it predicts decay rates which are approximately correct. A simulation method which calculates the galactic gravitational field to second order in a multipole expansion gives results in agreement with full N-body experiments, but it runs several hundred times faster for N = 5000; It is only a factor of 2 or 3 slower than methods based on a generalization of the restricted three-body problem.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new two-parameter family of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy models. The mass distribution has a Plummer profile and falls like R-4 in projection, in agreement with the star-count data. The first free parameter controls the velocity anisotropy and the second controls the dark matter content. The dark matter distribution can be varied from one extreme of mass-follows-light through a near-isothermal halo with flat rotation curve to the other extreme of an extended dark halo with harmonic core. This family of models is explored analytically in some detail - the distribution functions, the intrinsic moments and the projected moments are all calculated. For the nearby Galactic dSphs, samples of hundreds of discrete radial velocities are becoming available. A technique is developed to extract the anisotropy and dark matter content from such data sets by maximizing the likelihood function of the sample of radial velocities. This is constructed from the distribution function and corrected for observational errors and the effects of binaries. Tests on simulated data sets show that samples of {\textasciitilde}1000 discrete radial velocities are ample to break the degeneracy between mass and anisotropy in the nearby dSphs. Interesting constraints can already be placed on the distribution of the dark matter with samples of {\textasciitilde}160 radial velocities (the size of the present-day data set for Draco). The Space Interferometry Mission or SIM allows very accurate differential astrometry at faint magnitudes. This can be used to measure the internal proper motions of stars in the nearby Galactic dSphs. Our simulations show that {\textasciitilde}100 proper motions are sufficient to demolish the mass-anisotropy degeneracy completely. The target stars in Draco are at magnitudes of V{\textasciitilde}19-20 and the required proper motion accuracy is 3-6{$\mu$}asyr-1. The measurement of the proper motions of a sample of {\textasciitilde}100 stars uncontaminated with binaries will take about 400h of SIM time, or under 2 per cent of the mission lifetime.},

Both profiles show a sharp decline in the velocity dispersion outside {\textasciitilde}30' (Draco) and {\textasciitilde}40' (UMi). New deep photometry of Draco reveals a break in the light profile at {\textasciitilde}25'. These data imply the existence of a kinematically cold population in the outer parts of both galaxies. Possible explanations of both the photometric and the kinematic data in terms of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium models are discussed in detail.

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are observed to have linearly rising rotation curves, which indicate constant density cores in their centers. These do not arise naturally from dark matter only simulations, giving rise to the ``core-cusp'' problem. Hydrodynamic simulations incorporating baryonic feedback can create cored profiles, but this solution requires some fine tuning. Additionally, there is a related ``diversity'' problem in which simulations cannot reproduce the large range in rotation curve shapes for galaxies of similar mass. Here we investigate, for the first time, whether a theoretical model based on statistical mechanics (DARKexp) can produce flat density cores with its single shape parameter. We find that these theoretical profiles are able to fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies with last measured velocities in the range {\textasciitilde} 20-200 km/s by producing fits to 96 SPARC catalog galaxies covering this range. We additionally show that the projected stellar density distributions of ultrafaint dwarfs that show cores are also well fit, and that wave, or fuzzy dark matter is unable to fit the full range of SPARC galaxies. Thus, DARKexp appears to be able to address the core-cusp problem and the diversity of rotation curves in these dark matter dominated galaxies with cold collisionless dark matter alone, i.e., without introducing baryonic feedback, or alternative nature of dark matter.},

  abstract = {A growing number of low luminosity and low surface brightness astronomical objects challenge traditional notions of both galaxies and star clusters. To address this challenge, we propose a definition of galaxy that does not depend on a cold dark matter model of the universe: a galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars whose properties cannot be explained by a combination of baryons and Newton's laws of gravity. After exploring several possible observational diagnostics of this definition, we critically examine the classification of ultra-faint dwarfs, globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and tidal dwarfs. While kinematic studies provide an effective diagnostic of the definition in many regimes, they can be less useful for compact or very faint systems. To explore the utility of using the [Fe/H] spread as a complementary diagnostic, we use published spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of 16 Milky Way dwarfs and 24 globular clusters to uniformly calculate their [Fe/H] spreads and associated uncertainties. Our principal results are (1) no known, old star cluster less luminous than MV = -10 has a significant (gsim0.1 dex) spread in its iron abundance; (2) known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies can be unambiguously classified with a combination of kinematic and [Fe/H] observations; (3) the observed [Fe/H] spreads in massive (gsim 106 M {$\odot$}) globular clusters do not necessarily imply that they are the stripped nuclei of dwarfs, nor a need for dark matter; and (4) if ultra-compact dwarf galaxies reside in dark matter halos akin to those of ultra-faint dwarfs of the same half-light radii, then they will show no clear dynamical signature of dark matter. We suggest several measurements that may assist the future classification of massive globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and ultra-faint galaxies. Our galaxy definition is designed to be independent of the details of current observations and models, while our proposed diagnostics can be refined or replaced as our understanding of the universe evolves.},

To investigate how the formation and evolution of galaxies take place in Milgromian gravity (MOND), we present full hydrodynamical simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code. These are the first-ever galaxy formation simulations done in MOND with detailed hydrodynamics, including star formation, stellar feedback, radiative transfer, and supernovae. These models start from simplified initial conditions, in the form of isolated, rotating gas spheres in the early universe. These collapse and form late-type galaxies obeying several scaling relations, which was not a priori expected. The formed galaxies have a compact bulge and a disk with exponentially decreasing surface mass density profiles and scale lengths consistent with observed galaxies, as well as vertical stellar mass distributions with distinct exponential profiles (thin and thick disk). This work thus shows for the first time that disk galaxies with exponential profiles in both gas and stars are a generic outcome of collapsing gas clouds in MOND. These models have a slight lack of stellar angular momentum because of their somewhat compact stellar bulge, which is connected to the simple initial conditions and the negligible later gas accretion. We also analyze how the addition of more complex baryonic physics changes the resulting main properties of the models and find this to be negligibly so in the Milgromian framework.},

Using MMFS at the Magellan/Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, we have acquired 8855 spectra from 7103 red-giant candidates in these Galactic satellites. We list measurements of each star's line-of-sight velocity (median error {\textpm}2.1 km s-1) and spectral line indices for iron and magnesium absorption features. We use globular cluster spectra to calibrate the indices onto standard [Fe/H] metallicity scales, but comparison of the resulting metallicities with published values suggests that the MMFS indices are best used as indicators of relative, not absolute, metallicity. The empirical distributions of velocity and spectral indices also allow us to quantify the amount of contamination by foreground stars. In a companion paper, we develop an algorithm that evaluates the membership probability for each star, showing that the present MMFS sample contains more than 5000 dSph members, including 774 Carina members, 2483 Fornax members, 1365 Sculptor members, and 441 Sextans members.

  abstract = {We derive an accurate mass estimator for dispersion-supported stellar systems and demonstrate its validity by analysing resolved line-of-sight velocity data for globular clusters, dwarf galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Specifically, by manipulating the spherical Jeans equation we show that the mass enclosed within the 3D deprojected half-light radius r1/2 can be determined with only mild assumptions about the spatial variation of the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy as long as the projected velocity dispersion profile is fairly flat near the half-light radius, as is typically observed. We find M1/2 = 3 G-1{$<$} {$\sigma$}2los {$>$} r1/2 {\textasciitilde}= 4 G-1{$<$} {$\sigma$}2los {$>$} Re, where {$<$} {$\sigma$}2los {$>$} is the luminosity-weighted square of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and Re is the 2D projected half-light radius. While deceptively familiar in form, this formula is not the virial theorem, which cannot be used to determine accurate masses unless the radial profile of the total mass is known a priori. We utilize this finding to show that all of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (MW dSphs) are consistent with having formed within a halo of a mass of approximately 3 {\texttimes} 109 Msolar, assuming a {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmology. The faintest MW dSphs seem to have formed in dark matter haloes that are at least as massive as those of the brightest MW dSphs, despite the almost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity between them. We expand our analysis to the full range of observed dispersion-supported stellar systems and examine their dynamical I-band mass-to-light ratios {$\Upsilon$}I1/2. The {$\Upsilon$}I1/2 versus M1/2 relation for dispersion-supported galaxies follows a U shape, with a broad minimum near {$\Upsilon$}I1/2 {\textasciitilde}= 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal ellipticals, a steep rise to {$\Upsilon$}I1/2 {\textasciitilde}= 3200 for ultra-faint dSphs and a more shallow rise to {$\Upsilon$}I1/2 {\textasciitilde}= 800 for galaxy cluster spheroids.},

It is then extended to a 4D space that includes a stellar population parameter such as metallicity Z or star formation rate . We find that the local group dwarfs basically define a one-parameter `fundamental line' (FL), primarily driven by stellar mass, M*. A more detailed inspection reveals differences between the star formation properties of dwarf irregulars (dI's) and dwarf ellipticals (dE's), beyond the tendency of the latter to be more massive. In particular, the metallicities of dI's are typically lower by a factor of 3 at a given M* and they grow faster with increasing M*, showing a tighter FL in the 4D space for the dE's. The structural scaling relations of dI's resemble those of the more massive spirals, but the dI's have lower star formation rates for a given M* which also grow faster with increasing M*. On the other hand, the FL of the dE's departs from the fundamental plane of bigger ellipticals. While the one-parameter nature of the FL and the associated slopes of the scaling relations are consistent with the general predictions of supernova feedback from Dekel \& Woo, the differences between the FL's of the dE's and the dI's remain a challenge and should serve as a guide for the secondary physical processes responsible for these two types.},

  abstract = {Stellar streams are particularly sensitive probes of the mass distribution of galaxies. In this work, we focus on the Helmi Streams, the remnants of an accreted dwarf galaxy orbiting the inner Milky Way. We examine in depth their peculiar dynamical properties, and use these to provide tight constraints on the Galactic potential, and specifically on its dark matter halo in the inner 20 kpc. We extract 6D phase-space information for the Helmi Streams from Gaia DR3, and confirm that the Streams split up into two clumps in angular momentum space, and that these depict different degrees of phase-mixing. To explain these characteristics we explore a range of Galactic potential models with a triaxial NFW halo, further constrained by rotation curve data. We find that a Galactic potential with a mildly triaxial dark matter halo, having \$p=1.013{\textasciicircum}\{+0.006\}\_\{-0.006\}\$, \$q=1.204{\textasciicircum}\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.036\}\$, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{discs\}\}=4.65{\textasciicircum}\{+0.47\}\_\{-0.57\}{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{DM\}\}({$<$} 15 {\textbackslash}text\{kpc\})=1.14{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.10\}{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, is required to form two clumps in angular momentum space over time. Their formation is driven by the fact that the clumps are on different orbital families and close to an orbital resonance. This resonance also explains the different degrees of mixing observed, as well as the presence of a dynamically cold subclump (also known as S2). This first and very precise measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Galaxy uniquely reveals the high sensitivity of phase-mixed streams to the exact form of the gravitational potential.},

  abstract = {The Local Group hosts a number of dwarf galaxies that show evidence of periods of little to no star formation. We use a suite of cosmological simulations to study how star formation is reignited in such galaxies. We focus on isolated galaxies at z = 0 with halo masses between 9.2 {\texttimes} 108 and 8.4 {\texttimes} 109 M{$\odot$}, where star formation is typically shut off by reionization or by supernova feedback. Nearly 20 per cent of these simulated galaxies later restart star formation due to interactions with streams of gas in the intergalactic medium, indicating that this mechanism is relatively common in this mass range and that many isolated dwarfs at z = 0 may not have been isolated throughout their histories. While high ram pressure interactions lead to stripping, the encounters that reignite star formation are low density and/or low velocity and thus low ram pressure, resulting in compression of the hot gas in the haloes of our dwarfs. The gas mass bound up in hot haloes can be substantial - at least an order of magnitude greater than the mass contained in H I. Consequently, we find that dwarfs that have experienced reignition tend to be more H I-rich and have a higher M\_\{H I\}/M\_\{*\} ratio at z = 0 than galaxies with continuous star formation. Using this fact, we identify galaxies in the Local Volume that might have `gappy' star formation histories, and can be studied by the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope.},

We find that nearly all large angular momentum changes of stars are caused by star-clump encounters with the closest approach less than 0.5 kpc. During star-clump encounters, stars may increase their random motions, resulting in an increase in the average radial and vertical actions of the whole stellar population. The angular momentum change and the radial action change of an individual star are influenced by the direction from which the star approaches a clump. A star initially at a higher galactic radius relative to the scattering clump usually gets pulled inwards and loses its angular momentum during the encounter, and one at a lower radius tends to shift outwards and gains angular momentum. The increase in the radial action is the largest if a star encounters a clump from the azimuthal direction, and is the smallest from a radial approach. The angular momentum change due to encounters has an inward bias when the clump profile has a steep radial decline, and a shallow decline can make the bias outwards. The stellar profile evolution towards an exponential seems to occur regardless of the direction of the bias.},

  abstract = {Low-mass stars, those with main-sequence lifetimes that are of order the age of the Universe, provide unique constraints on the Initial Mass Function (IMF) when they formed. Star counts in systems with simple star-formation histories are particularly straightforward to interpret, and those in old systems allow one to determine the low-mass stellar IMF at large look-back times and thus at high redshift. We present the faint stellar luminosity function (based on optical HST data) in an external galaxy, the Ursa Minor dwarf Spheroidal (dSph). This relatively-nearby (distance 70kpc) companion galaxy to the Milky Way has a stellar population with narrow distributions of age and of metallicity, remarkably similar to that of a classical halo globular cluster such as M92 or M15, i.e. old and metal-poor. Contrasting with globular clusters, the internal velocity dispersion of the Ursa Minor dSph indicates the presence of significant amounts of dark matter. We find that the main sequence stellar luminosity function of the Ursa Minor dSph, and implied IMF, down to 0.4 of a solar mass is indistinguishable from that of the halo globular clusters M92 and M15. Thus the low mass stellar IMF for stars that formed at high redshift is invariant in going from a low-surface-brightness, dark-matter-dominated external galaxy, to a globular cluster within the Milky Way.},

We quantify how the reflex motion varies as a function of Galactocentric distance, finding that (i) the amplitude of the dipole signal increases as a function of radius, and (ii) the direction moves across the sky. We compare the reflex motion signal against a compilation of published models that follow the MW-LMC interaction. These models show a similar trend of increasing amplitude of the reflex motion as a function of distance, but they do not reproduce the direction of the disc motion with respect to the stellar halo well. We also report mean motions for the stellar halo as a function of distance, finding radial compression in the outer halo and non-zero prograde rotation at all radii. The observed compression signal is also present in MW-LMC models, but the rotation is not, which suggests that the latter is not induced by the LMC. We extensively validate our technique to measure reflex motion against idealized tests. We discuss prospects for directly constraining the mass and orbital history of the LMC through the impact on the motion of the MW stellar disc, and how the modelling of the reflex motion can be improved as more and better data become available.},

  abstract = {The Milky Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites are known to be the most dark-matter (DM) dominated galaxies with estimates of dark-to-baryonic matter reaching even above 100. It comes from the assumption that dwarfs are dynamically supported by their observed velocity dispersions. However, their spatial distributions around the MW are not at random and this could challenge their origin, previously assumed to be residues of primordial galaxies accreted by the MW potential. Here, we show that, alternatively, dSphs could be the residue of tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), which would have interacted with the Galactic hot gaseous halo and disc. TDGs are gas rich and have been formed in a tidal tail produced during an ancient merger event at the M31 location, and expelled towards the MW. Our simulations show that low-mass TDGs are fragile to an interaction with the MW disc and halo hot gas. During the interaction, their stellar content is progressively driven out of equilibrium and strongly expands, leading to low surface brightness feature and mimicking high dynamical M/L ratios. Our modelling can reproduce the properties, including the kinematics, of classical MW dwarfs within the mass range of the Magellanic Clouds to Draco. An ancient gas-rich merger at the M31 location could then challenge the currently assumed high content of DM in dwarf galaxies. We propose a simple observational test with the coming GAIA mission, to follow their expected stellar expansion, which should not be observed within the current theoretical framework.},

Our pre-selection of stars belonging to Fornax is based on their proper motions, parallaxes, and colour-magnitude diagram. The latter criteria provide a Fornax star sample, which we further restrict by colour and magnitude to eliminate contaminations due to either Milky Way stars or QSOs. The precision of the data has been sufficient to reach extremely small contaminations (0.02-0.3 per cent), allowing us to reach to a background level 12 magnitudes deeper than the central surface brightness of Fornax. We discover a break in the density profile, which reveals the presence of an additional component that extents 2.1 degree in radius, i.e. 5.4 kpc, and almost seven times the half-light radius of Fornax. The extended new component represents 10 per cent of the stellar mass of Fornax, and behaves like an extended halo. The absence of tidally elongated features at such an unprecedented depth (equivalent to 37.94 {\textpm} 0.16 mag arcsec-2 in V-band) rules out a possible role of tidal stripping. We instead suggest that Fornax is likely at first infall, and has lost its gas very recently, which consequently leads to a lack of gravity implying that residual stars have spherically expanded to form the newly discovered stellar halo of Fornax.},

  abstract = {In this work, we employ a multicomponent decomposition model to study the Sextans and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which have distinct evolutionary histories. Sextans exhibits massive stars dominating in the early stages of its evolution and a lower contribution from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). With increasing metallicity, the evolution of massive stars in Sextans shows two turning points, at [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2.8 and [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2.0, indicating episodes of accretion events and galactic winds during its evolution. In the late stages, influenced by galactic winds, the contribution from massive stars ceases, and SNe Ia become the dominant evolutionary process. Sculptor exhibits contributions from the main r-process, early very massive stars, massive stars, SNe Ia, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In its early stages, the contributions from early very massive stars and massive stars are dominant, while the contribution from SNe Ia is low. Around [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2, the contribution from early very massive stars starts to decline, while the contributions from SNe Ia and massive stars continue to increase. At [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -1.7, the contribution from massive stars gradually decreases and approaches the level of the solar neighborhood, while the contribution from AGB stars continues to rise with increasing metallicity. Both dwarf galaxies exhibit characteristic features of similar initial mass functions, but the Sextans dwarf galaxy exhibits a high-mass cutoff, while the Sculptor dwarf galaxy does not. Additionally, through decomposition, we can analyze the contributions of different astrophysical processes to [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H], [iron-group/Fe] versus [Fe/H], and [neutron-capture/Fe] versus [Fe/H].},

The location of the stream approaches the Galactic center, implying a possible connection between its orbit and its unusual morphology. Here we demonstrate that the morphology of Ophiuchus can be attributed to its interaction with the decelerating Galactic bar, which leads to the flipping or transposition of its tidal tails. The short length of the stream is the result of stars stripped in the ancient past still remaining concentrated, and the spur, as well as the fanning, are composed of either leading or trailing tails built up of stars released at different time intervals. Our new spectroscopic data, obtained as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey, and modeling of Ophiuchus indicate that, in the presence of the bar, an initial leading tail can be redistributed to the trailing side and vice versa, and the morphology of a stream can be reshaped. This result confirms that the Galactic bar plays a vital role in reconstructing the orbital behavior of streams passing close to the central region of the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Self-interacting dark matter is an attractive alternative to the cold dark matter paradigm only if it is able to substantially reduce the central densities of dwarf-size haloes while keeping the densities and shapes of cluster-size haloes within current constraints. Given the seemingly stringent nature of the latter, it was thought for nearly a decade that self-interacting dark matter would be viable only if the cross-section for self-scattering was strongly velocity dependent. However, it has recently been suggested that a constant cross-section per unit mass of {$\sigma$}T/m {$\sim$} 0.1 cm2 g-1 is sufficient to accomplish the desired effect. We explicitly investigate this claim using high-resolution cosmological simulations of a Milky Way-size halo and find that, similarly to the cold dark matter case, such cross-section produces a population of massive subhaloes that is inconsistent with the kinematics of the classical dwarf spheroidals, in particular with the inferred slopes of the mass profiles of Fornax and Sculptor. This problem is resolved if {$\sigma$}T/m {$\sim$} 1 cm2 g-1 at the dwarf spheroidal scales. Since this value is likely inconsistent with the halo shapes of several clusters, our results leave only a small window open for a velocity-independent self-interacting dark matter model to work as a distinct alternative to cold dark matter.},

  abstract = {We present a new discrete chemo-dynamical axisymmetric modelling technique, which we apply to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. The major improvement over previous Jeans models is that realistic chemical distributions are included directly in the dynamical modelling of the discrete data. This avoids loss of information due to spatial binning and eliminates the need for hard cuts to remove contaminants and to separate stars based on their chemical properties. Using a combined likelihood in position, metallicity and kinematics, we find that our models naturally separate Sculptor stars into a metal-rich and a metal-poor population. Allowing for non-spherical symmetry, our approach provides a central slope of the dark matter density of {$\gamma$} = 0.5 {\textpm} 0.3. The metal-rich population is nearly isotropic (with {$\beta$} \_r{\textasciicircum}\{red\} = 0.0{\textpm} 0.1), while the metal-poor population is tangentially anisotropic (with {$\beta$} \_r{\textasciicircum}\{blue\} = -0.2{\textpm} 0.1) around the half-light radius of 0.26 kpc. A weak internal rotation of the metal-rich population is revealed with vmax/{$\sigma$}0 = 0.15 {\textpm} 0.15. We run tests using mock data to show that a discrete data set with {$\sim$}6000 stars is required to distinguish between a core ({$\gamma$} = 0) and cusp ({$\gamma$} = 1), and to constrain the possible internal rotation to better than 1{$\sigma$} confidence with our model. We conclude that our discrete chemo-dynamical modelling technique provides a flexible and powerful tool to robustly constrain the internal dynamics of multiple populations, and the total mass distribution in a stellar system.},

  abstract = {We study the impact of baryons on the distribution of dark matter in a Milky Way-sized halo by comparing a high-resolution, moving mesh cosmological simulation with its dark matter-only counterpart. We identify three main processes related to baryons - adiabatic contraction, tidal disruption, and reionization - which jointly shape the dark matter distribution in both the main halo and its subhaloes. The relative effect of each baryonic process depends strongly on the subhalo mass. For massive subhaloes with maximum circular velocity vmax {$>$} 35 km s-1, adiabatic contraction increases the dark matter concentration, making these haloes less susceptible to tidal disruption. For low-mass subhaloes with vmax {$<$} 20 km s-1, reionization effectively reduces their mass on average by {$\approx$}30 per cent and vmax by {$\approx$}20 per cent. For intermediate subhaloes with 20 km s-1 {$<$} vmax {$<$} 35 km s-1, which share a similar mass range as the classical dwarf spheroidals, strong tidal truncation induced by the main galaxy reduces their vmax. As a combined result of reionization and increased tidal disruption, the total number of low-mass subhaloes in the hydrodynamic simulation is nearly halved compared to that of the N-body simulation. We do not find dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies, unlike previous studies that employed bursty feedback-driven outflows. The substantial impact of baryons on the abundance and internal structure of subhaloes suggests that galaxy formation and evolution models based on N-body simulations should include these physical processes as major components.},
