  abstract = {Context. The chemical composition of the Sun is a fundamental yardstick in astronomy, relative to which essentially all cosmic objects are referenced. As such, having accurate knowledge of the solar elemental abundances is crucial for an extremely broad range of topics. Aims: We reassess the solar abundances of all 83 long-lived elements, using highly realistic solar modelling and state-of-the-art spectroscopic analysis techniques coupled with the best available atomic data and observations. Methods: The basis for our solar spectroscopic analysis is a three-dimensional (3D) radiative-hydrodynamical model of the solar surface convection and atmosphere, which reproduces the full arsenal of key observational diagnostics. New complete and comprehensive 3D spectral line formation calculations taking into account of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) are presented for Na, Mg, K, Ca, and Fe using comprehensive model atoms with reliable radiative and collisional data. Our newly derived abundances for C, N, and O are based on a 3D non-LTE analysis of permitted and forbidden atomic lines as well as 3D LTE calculations for a total of 879 molecular transitions of CH, C2, CO, NH, CN, and OH. Previous 3D-based calculations for another 50 elements are re-evaluated based on updated atomic data, a stringent selection of lines, improved consideration of blends, and new non-LTE calculations available in the literature. For elements where spectroscopic determinations of the quiet Sun are not possible, the recommended solar abundances are revisited based on complementary methods, including helioseismology (He), solar wind data from the Genesis sample return mission (noble gases), sunspot observations (four elements), and measurements of the most primitive meteorites (15 elements). Results: Our new improved analysis confirms the relatively low solar abundances of C, N, and O obtained in our previous 3D-based studies: log {$\epsilon$}C = 8.46 {\textpm} 0.04, log {$\epsilon$}N = 7.83 {\textpm} 0.07, and log {$\epsilon$}O = 8.69 {\textpm} 0.04. Excellent agreement between all available atomic and molecular indicators is achieved for C and O, but for N the atomic lines imply a lower abundance than for the molecular transitions for unknown reasons. The revised solar abundances for the other elements also typically agree well with our previously recommended values, with only Li, F, Ne, Mg, Cl, Kr, Rb, Rh, Ba, W, Ir, and Pb differing by more than 0.05 dex. The here-advocated present-day photospheric metal mass fraction is only slightly higher than our previous value, mainly due to the revised Ne abundance from Genesis solar wind measurements: Xsurface = 0.7438 {\textpm} 0.0054, Ysurface = 0.2423 {\textpm} 0.0054, Zsurface = 0.0139 {\textpm} 0.0006, and Zsurface/Xsurface = 0.0187 {\textpm} 0.0009. Overall, the solar abundances agree well with those of CI chondritic meteorites, but we identify a correlation with condensation temperature such that moderately volatile elements are enhanced by {$\approx$}0.04 dex in the CI chondrites and refractory elements possibly depleted by {$\approx$}0.02 dex, conflicting with conventional wisdom of the past half-century. Instead, the solar chemical composition more closely resembles that of the fine-grained matrix of CM chondrites with the expected exception of the highly volatile elements. Conclusions: Updated present-day solar photospheric and proto-solar abundances are presented for 83 elements, including for all long-lived isotopes. The so-called solar modelling problem - a persistent discrepancy between helioseismology and solar interior models constructed with a low solar metallicity similar to that advocated here - remains intact with our revised solar abundances, suggesting shortcomings with the computed opacities and/or treatment of mixing below the convection zone in existing standard solar models. The uncovered trend between the solar and CI chondritic abundances with condensation temperature is not yet understood but is likely imprinted by planet formation, especially since a similar trend of opposite sign is observed between the Sun and solar twins.},

The C2 and CN band strengths are found to be well correlated with each other, although there is a wide range in band strength at fixed color. The number of carbon stars is shown not to be a simple function of parent galaxy luminosity nor of metallicity. Only one carbon star is detected in Leo I. The newly discovered Ursa Minor C star lies well below the giant branch tip in the color-magnitude diagram, and it is suggested that the location of this star may support the argument that more than one process is required to make dwarf spheroidal carbon stars. It is concluded that mechanisms for producing carbon stars are favored in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, as opposed to globular clusters in our Galaxy, although the nature and number of the physical mechanisms required to account for the large range observed in C star luminosity and spectral appearance are still unresolved.},

These observations demonstrate that measurement of radial velocities having such high precision is quite feasible for stars as faint as V = 18 mag. The data presented here are of importance for understanding the dynamical history of the dwarf systems. In addition, they provide a first and tantalizing hint of the velocity dispersion in a dwarf spheroidal and suggest that Draco may have a mass-to-light ratio an order of magnitude greater than that found for galactic globulars. If confirmed, this result would support the existence of a massive halo about the Galaxy. It would furthermore rule out the possibility that neutrinos could provide a solution to the missing mass problem, if the dark matter on small and large scales is similar.},

  abstract = {Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are observed as a substantial fraction of the very metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo. Most CEMP stars are also enriched in \emph{s{$<$}i/{$>$}-process elements, and these are often found in binary systems. This suggests that the carbon enrichment is due to mass transfer in the past from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star on to a low-mass companion. Models of binary population synthesis are not able to reproduce the observed fraction of CEMP stars without invoking non-standard nucleosynthesis or a substantial change in the initial mass function. This is interpreted as evidence of missing physical ingredients in the models. Recent hydrodynamical simulations show that efficient wind mass transfer is possible in the case of the slow and dense winds typical of AGB stars through a mechanism called wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF), which lies in between the canonical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion and Roche-lobe overflow. WRLOF has an effect on the accretion efficiency of mass transfer and on the angular momentum lost by the binary system. The aim of this work is to understand the overall effect of WRLOF on the population of CEMP stars. To simulate populations of low-metallicity binaries we combined a synthetic nucleosynthesis model with a binary population synthesis code. In this code we implemented the WRLOF mechanism. We used the results of hydrodynamical simulations to model the effect of WRLOF on the accretion efficiency, and we took the effect on the angular momentum loss into account by assuming a simple prescription. The combination of these two effects widens the range of systems that become CEMP stars towards longer initial orbital periods and lower mass secondary stars. As a consequence the number of CEMP stars predicted by our model increases by a factor 1.2-1.8 compared to earlier results that consider the BHL prescription. Moreover, higher enrichments of carbon are produced, and the final orbital period distribution is shifted towards shorter periods.}},

  abstract = {With the increasing number of large stellar survey projects, the quality and quantity of excellent tracers for studying the Milky Way are rapidly growing, one of which is the classical Cepheids. Classical Cepheids are high-precision standard candles with very low typical uncertainties ({$<$}3\%) available via the mid-infrared period-luminosity relation. About 3500 classical Cepheids identified from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova, Gaia, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Zwicky Transient Facility survey data have been analyzed in this work, and their spatial distributions show a clear signature of Galactic warp. Two kinematical methods are adopted to measure the Galactic rotation curve (RC) in the Galactocentric distance range of \$4{\textbackslash}lesssim \{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GC\}\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 19{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ . Gently declining RCs are derived by both the proper motion (PM) method and three-dimensional velocity vector (3DV) method. The largest sample of classical Cepheids with the most accurate 6D phase-space coordinates available to date are modeled in the 3DV method, and the resulting RC is found to decline at the relatively smaller gradient of (-1.33 {\textpm} 0.1) \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ . Comparing to results from the PM method, a higher rotation velocity ((232.5 {\textpm} 0.83) \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ ) is derived at the position of the Sun in the 3DV method. The virial mass and local dark matter density are estimated from the 3DV method, which is the more reliable method, \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}=(0.822{\textbackslash}pm 0.052){\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}rho \}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{DM\},{\textbackslash}odot \}=0.33{\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$ GeV, respectively.},

  abstract = {We present new constraints on the density profiles of dark matter (DM) halos in seven nearby dwarf galaxies from measurements of their integrated stellar light and gas kinematics. The gas kinematics of low-mass galaxies frequently suggest that they contain constant density DM cores, while N-body simulations instead predict a cuspy profile. We present a data set of high-resolution integral-field spectroscopy on seven galaxies and measure the stellar and gas kinematics simultaneously. Using Jeans modeling on our full sample, we examine whether gas kinematics in general produce shallower density profiles than are derived from the stars. Although two of the seven galaxies show some localized differences in their rotation curves between the two tracers, estimates of the central logarithmic slope of the DM density profile, {$\gamma$}, are generally robust. The mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic slope for the population are {$\gamma$} = 0.67 {\textpm} 0.10 when measured in the stars and {$\gamma$} = 0.58 {\textpm} 0.24 when measured in the gas. We also find that the halos are not under-concentrated at the radii of half their maximum velocities. Finally, we search for correlations of the DM density profile with stellar velocity anisotropy and other baryonic properties. Two popular mechanisms to explain cored DM halos are an exotic DM component or feedback models that strongly couple the energy of supernovae into repeatedly driving out gas and dynamically heating the DM halos. While such models do not yet have falsifiable predictions that we can measure, we investigate correlations that may eventually be used to test models. We do not find a secondary parameter that strongly correlates with the central DM density slope, but we do find some weak correlations. The central DM density slope weakly correlates with the abundance of {$\alpha$} elements in the stellar population, anti-correlates with H i fraction, and anti-correlates with vertical orbital anisotropy. We expect, if anything, the opposite of these three trends for feedback models. Determining the importance of these correlations will require further model developments and larger observational samples.},

As each population must reside in the same gravitational potential, this provides strong constraints on the nature of the dark matter halo. We derive necessary conditions for two populations with Plummer or exponential surface brightnesses to reside in a cusped Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo. We apply our methods to the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal, and show that there is no NFW halo compatible with the energetics of the two populations. The dark halo must possess a core radius of {\textasciitilde}120 pc for the virial solutions for the two populations to be consistent. This conclusion remains true, even if the effects of flattening or self-gravity of the stellar populations are included.},

  abstract = {Extensive numerical simulations were performed to support a theoretical discussion of first-order tidal limitation of satellites on both circular and elongated orbits in softened external potentials. The existing theory is good for satellites on circular orbits but fails dramatically for noncircular orbits. The mass distribution is much less strongly truncated for elongated orbits than conventionally determined by circular theory applied at pericenter. A new first-order theory for elongated orbits is presented which is in good agreement with the simulations for pericenter not too close to the softened cluster center. For an analytic King model external potential with core radius a-prime, the theory is good down to a pericenter of 3(a-prime). Below this the maximum tide is no longer at pericenter and the theory is inappropriate. Successive passages through pericenter do not noticeably reduce the tidal radius, although continual small mass loss from second-order heating is apparent. The importance of mean field tidal limitation on galaxy evolution in clusters have been overestimated in recent studies. Galaxies on noncircular orbits in clusters are well within their tidal radii even if they pass within one core radius of the center of the cluster.},

The new potential is completely analytical; the density can be obtained from it in closed form and it is positive everywhere. Extreme mathematical simplicity is retained, as well as a good representation of the observed values of both the rotation curve and the perpendicular force. The new model consists of a spherical central bulge and a disk, both of the Miyamoto-Nagai (1975) form, plus a massive, spherical, halo. The total mass of the model is 9.00x1011 solar masses. The model escape velocity for objects in the solar vicinity is 535.7 km s-1. The values obtained for the galactic rotation constants are A = 12.95 km s-1kpc-1 and B = -12.93 km s-1kpc-1; they are in good agreement with recent observational data. In contrast to other models for our galaxy, the proposed potential function is extremely simple, fully analytical, continuous, and with continuous derivatives everywhere. The suitability of this potential for efficient and accurate numerical orbit computations is demonstrated by recalculating the orbits of several nearby, high velocity stars.},

  abstract = {The historical evolution of the traditional correspondences of planets and metals and of knowledge of the planetary arrangements is reviewed. The traditional geocentric sequence of the planets generates not only the sequence of days of the week, whose names are taken from the deities traditionally associated with the planets, but also a ranking by atomic number of the metals traditionally associated with the planets. The probability that this could be coincidental is quite low, about 1/120. Yet this is not a contemporary artifact nor the result of ancient knowledge of unknown provenance. The concept of synchronicity is a possible working hypothesis. Corroboration or refutation of this approach would depend on further research work on other anomalous events, for which the existence of a hidden causal origin is also highly unlikely. Ancient and mediaeval astrology associated the planets with specific metals. The (geocentric) arrangement of the planets in Greek astronomy turns out to match a pattern generated by the ranking by atomic number of the corresponding metals, even though knowledge of such atomic properties came only much later. The probability of such a conjunction is low, less than 1\%. One might search for possible relations between some ancient beliefs and scientific knowledge acquired only much later, or one might consider the idea that meaningful inter- connections between causally unrelated events may be systematic, as several writers have proposed (Jung, 1973; Kammerer, 1919). In the following section, the history of the geocentric arrangement of the planets and of the origin of the ''planetary week'' are reviewed. Then, the history of the assignment of metals to planets is presented, and the correlation of the atomic order of metals with the geocentric distance of the corresponding planets is described. In the last section, the possible implications of these parallel arrangements are discussed. References to the ancient literature are given in the standard way in square brackets. Most of these texts may be found in recent editions of the ''Thesaurus Linguae Graecae'' (TLG).}

  abstract = {Deep observations are revealing a growing number of young galaxies in the first billion years of cosmic time1. Compared to typical galaxies at later times, they show more extreme emission-line properties2, higher star formation rates3, lower masses4, and smaller sizes5. However, their faintness precludes studies of their chemical abundances and ionization conditions, strongly limiting our understanding of the physics driving early galaxy build-up and metal enrichment. Here we study a rare population of ultraviolet-selected, low-luminosity galaxies at redshift 2.4 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5 that exhibit all the rest-frame properties expected from primeval galaxies. These low-mass, highly compact systems are rapidly forming galaxies able to double their stellar mass in only a few tens of millions of years. They are characterized by very blue ultraviolet spectra with weak absorption features and bright nebular emission lines, which imply hard radiation fields from young hot massive stars6,7. Their highly ionized gas phase has strongly sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances, with metallicities more than a factor of two lower than that found in typical galaxies of similar mass and star formation rate at z{$\leq$}2.58. These young galaxies reveal an early and short stage in the assembly of their galactic structures and their chemical evolution, a vigorous phase that is likely to be dominated by the effects of gas-rich mergers, accretion of metal-poor gas and strong outflows.},

  abstract = {Driven by gravity, massive structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies are believed to grow continuously through hierarchical merging and accretion of smaller systems. Observational evidence of accretion events is provided by the coherent stellar streams crossing the outer haloes of massive galaxies, such as the Milky Way or Andromeda. At similar mass scales, around 1011 solar masses in stars, further evidence of merging activity is also ample. Mergers of lower-mass galaxies are expected within the hierarchical process of galaxy formation, but have hitherto not been seen for galaxies with less than about 109 solar masses in stars. Here we report the kinematic detection of a stellar stream in one of the satellite galaxies of Andromeda, the dwarf spheroidal Andromeda II, which has a mass of only 107 solar masses in stars. The properties of the stream show that we are observing the remnant of a merger between two dwarf galaxies. This had a drastic influence on the dynamics of the remnant, which is now rotating around its projected major axis. The stellar stream in Andromeda II illustrates the scale-free character of the formation of galaxies, down to the lowest galactic mass scales.},

Assuming the efficiency of energy injection of the SNe II into DM particles is epsilongc = 0.05, we find that a single early episode, z {$>$}{\textasciitilde} z infall, that combines the energy of all SNe II due to explode over 0.5 Gyr is sufficient to create a core of several hundred parsecs in both Sculptor and Fornax. Therefore, our results suggest that it is energetically plausible to form cores in cold dark matter (CDM) halos via early episodic gas outflows triggered by SNe II. Furthermore, based on CDM merger rates and phase-space density considerations, we argue that the probability of a subsequent complete regeneration of the cusp is small for a substantial fraction of dwarf-size halos.},

We construct a new colour-absolute magnitude of BHB stars that we use to measure the distance gradients within the body of the dwarf galaxies. We detect a statistically significant non-zero gradient only in Sextans and Sculptor. Through modelling of the gradient and 2D density of the systems by triaxial Plummer models, we find that the distance gradients in both dwarf galaxies are inconsistent with prolate shape, but compatible with oblate or triaxial shapes. In order to explain the observed gradients, oblate models of Sextans and Sculptor need to have a significant intrinsic ellipticity larger than 0.47 for Sextans and 0.46 for Sculptor. The flattened oblate shape may imply a significant anisotropy in velocity distribution in order to be consistent with the lack of significant velocity gradients in these systems.},

  abstract = {Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has been proposed to address small-scale challenges faced by the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, such as the diverse density profiles observed in dwarf galaxies. In this study, we analyze the kinematics of dwarf galaxies by incorporating the effects of gravothermal core collapse into SIDM models using a semi-analytical subhalo framework. Our analysis covers the stellar kinematics of both classical and ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. The results indicate a bimodal preference for small and large self-interaction cross sections in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, while in classical dwarfs, larger cross sections progressively decrease the model's statistical support. The combined analysis decisively prefers CDM to SIDM when the self-interaction cross section per unit mass, \${\textbackslash}sigma/m\$, exceeds \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.2 cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$/g, if a velocity-independent cross section is assumed. Our study significantly enhances our understanding of dark matter dynamics on small scales.},

  abstract = {The Antlia dwarf galaxy, recently found to be a possible local Group member, is analyzed using VI photometry. The galaxy is resolved into a large number of stars and although the galaxy is intrinsically faint and of low surface brightness, its stellar populations reveal characteristics more typical of faint star-forming dIrs rather than dEs. Significant star formation is currently going on in the central part of Antlia although little or no star formation is taking place in the outer regions. This indicates a two-component (core-halo) morphology which appears to be common, not only in large spirals (disk-halo), but in dwarf galaxies as well. The SFR averaged over the lifetime of the galaxy is estimated to be {$\Psi$}- 1 Gyr/A{$\sim$}3-9{\texttimes}1010 Msun yr-1 pc-2 while the more recent star formation, averaged over the last 1 Gyr is much higher ({$\Psi$}1 Gyr/A{$\sim$}3- 9{\texttimes}1010 Msun yr-1 pc-2 for the central region). The total mass locked into stars and stellar remnants is estimated to be M*{$\sim$}2-4{\texttimes}106 Msun, estimated from the TRGB is 1.32{\textpm}0.06 Mpc, which places Antlia just beyond the Local Group, and makes it a close companion of the dwarf galaxy NGC 3109 ({$\Delta$}r{$\geq$}30 kpc), although it is not clear whether they are gravitationally bound.},

These three high-z galaxies show the detection of several strong emission nebular lines, including the temperature-sensitive [O III] {$\lambda$}4363 line, allowing us to directly determine the nebular conditions and abundances for O/H, C/O, and Ne/O. We derive O/H abundances and ionization parameters that are generally consistent with other recent analyses.

We also detect the C III] {$\lambda\lambda$}1907, 1909 emission in a z {$>$} 8 galaxy from which we determine the most distant C/O abundance to date. This valuable detection of log(C/O) = -0.83 {\textpm} 0.38 provides the first test of C/O redshift evolution out to high redshift. For neon, we use the high-ionization [Ne III] {$\lambda$}3869 line to measure the first Ne/O abundances at z {$>$} 7, finding no evolution in this {$\alpha$}-element ratio. We explore the tentative detection of [Fe II] and [Fe III] lines in a z {$>$} 8 galaxy, which would indicate a rapid buildup of metals. Importantly, we demonstrate that properly flux-calibrated and higher-S/N spectra are crucial to robustly determine the abundance pattern in z {$>$} 7 galaxies with NIRSpec/JWST.},

  abstract = {Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are a unique resource for Galactic archaeology because they probe the properties of the First Stars, early chemical evolution, and binary interactions at very low metallicity. Comparing the fractions and properties of CEMP stars in different Galactic environments can provide us with unique insights into the formation and evolution of the Milky Way halo and its building blocks. In this work, we investigate whether directly comparing fractions of CEMP stars from different literature samples of very metal-poor (\${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}, -2.0\$) stars is valid. We compiled published CEMP fractions and samples of Galactic halo stars from the past 25 years, and find that they are not all consistent with each other. Focusing on giant stars, we find significant differences between various surveys when comparing their trends of [Fe/H] versus [C/Fe] and their distributions of CEMP stars. To test the role of the analysis pipelines for low-resolution spectroscopic samples, we re-analysed giant stars from various surveys with the SSPP and FERRE pipelines. We found systematic differences in [C/Fe] of {\textasciitilde}0.1-0.4 dex, partly independent of degeneracies with the stellar atmospheric parameters. These systematics are likely due to the different pipeline approaches, different assumptions in the employed synthetic grids, and/or the comparison of different evolutionary phases. We conclude that current biases in (the analysis of) very metal-poor samples limit the conclusions one can draw from comparing different surveys. We provide some recommendations and suggestions that will hopefully aid the community to unlock the full potential of CEMP stars for Galactic archaeology.},

  abstract = {Ultra-metal-poor stars (\${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\}  -4.0\$) are very rare, and finding them is a challenging task. Both narrow-band photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy have been useful tools for identifying candidates, and in this work, we combine both approaches. We cross-matched metallicity-sensitive photometry from the Pristine survey with the low-resolution spectroscopic Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) data base, and re-analysed all LAMOST spectra with \${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\} \_\{{\textbackslash}rm Pristine\}  -2.5\$. We find that {\textasciitilde}1/3rd of this sample (selected without \${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\} \_\{{\textbackslash}rm Pristine\}\$ quality cuts) also have spectroscopic \${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\}  -2.5\$. From this sample, containing many low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra, we selected 11 stars potentially having \${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\}  -4.0\$ or \${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\}  -3.0\$ with very high carbon abundances, and we performed higher S/N medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with the Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We confirm their extremely low metallicities, with a mean of \${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\} = -3.4\$, and the most metal-poor star having \${\textbackslash}rm \{[Fe/H]\} = -3.8\$. Three of these are clearly carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with \$+1.65  {\textbackslash}rm \{[C/Fe]\}  +2.45\$. The two most carbon-rich stars are either among the most metal-poor CEMP-s stars or the most carbon-rich CEMP-no stars known, the third is likely a CEMP-no star. We derived orbital properties for the OSIRIS sample and find that only one of our targets can be confidently associated with known substructures/accretion events, and that three out of four inner halo stars have prograde orbits. Large spectroscopic surveys may contain many hidden extremely and ultra-metal-poor stars, and adding additional information from e.g. photometry as in this work can uncover them more efficiently and confidently.},

These velocities were obtained using the KPNO 4 m telescope with the Hydra multifiber positioner and bench spectrograph in 1992,1993, and 1994. Both simulations and repeated measurements show that the median uncertainty in these velocities is 4.0 km/s. Our velocities are compared with the other major datasets for Draco and Ursa Minor. Aside from a small zero-point difference, there is excellent agreement between the Hydra velocities and the Olszewski et al. MMT echelle velocities. Comparison with the Hargreaves et al. Ursa Minor velocities reveals inconsistencies which we ascribe to underestimated errors in the Hargreaves et al. data, After correcting for zero-point differences, we combine the three major sets of velocities. Our spectra recovered all of the known Carbon (C) stars in Draco and Ursa Minor and revealed one new C star in Draco and two in Ursa Minor. In addition, one star whose velocity is consistent with membership in Ursa Minor has a deep and wide H{$\beta$} absorption line in its spectrum. An initial discussion of the kinematics of the two galaxies is presented. The systemic velocities of Draco and Ursa Minor are -293.3 +/- 1.0 and -247.4 +/- 1.0 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, respectively. Ursa Minor shows apparent rotation about a position angle of 75{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} with an amplitude of about 3 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}; the morphological major axis is 53{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} +/-5{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum}. No such rotation is found in Draco. We find a velocity dispersion of 10.4 +/- 0.9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Ursa Minor including all stars and 8.8 +/- 0.8 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} excluding the star with the most extreme velocity. In Draco we find 10.7 +/- 0.9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} including all stars and 8.5 +/- 0.7 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} excluding the three stars with the most extreme velocities. These dispersions are consistent with the dispersions measured in the other two studies and confirm that Draco and Ursa Minor have the largest mass-to-light ratios of any of the dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {Aims: We aim to compute the binary fraction of "classical" dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) that are satellites of the Milky Way (MW). This value can offer insights into the binary fraction in environments that are less dense and more metal-poor than our own galaxy. Additionally, knowledge of the binary fraction in dwarf galaxies is important with respect to avoiding overestimations of their dark matter content, inferred from stellar kinematics. Methods: We refined an existing method from the literature, placing an emphasis on providing robust uncertainties on the value of the binary fraction. We applied this modified method to a VLT/FLAMES dataset for Sculptor, specifically acquired for the purpose of velocity monitoring of individual stars, as well as to literature datasets for other six MW "classical" dSphs. In all cases, the targeted stars were mainly red giant branch stars, with expected masses of around 0.8 M{$\odot$}. The VLT/FLAMES dataset offers the most precise binary fractions compared to literature datasets, due to its time baseline of 12 yr, along with at least nine repeated observations for each star. Results: We found that the binary fraction of Sculptor is 0.55-0.19+0.17. We find that it is important to take into account the Roche lobe overflow for constraining the period distribution of binary stars. In contrast to what has recently been proposed in the literature, our analysis indicates that there is no evidence to support varying the properties of the binary stellar population or their deviations from those established for the solar neighborhood, based on the sample of MW dSphs analyzed here.

  abstract = {Aims. Recently, both the presence of multiple stellar chemo-kinematic components and rotation in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy have been put into question. Therefore, we re-examine the chemo-kinematic properties of this galaxy, making use of the best spectroscopic dataset available containing both the line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of individual stars. Methods. We carried out a detailed, quantitative analysis on a recent spectroscopic dataset from the literature that contains high precision velocities and metallicities for 1339 members of Sculptor. In particular, we assessed whether Sculptor is best represented by a single stellar population with a negative metallicity gradient or by the super-position of two or more components with a different mean metallicity, spatial distribution, and kinematic properties. For this analysis, we also include the incompleteness of the spectroscopic dataset. Results. We find that Sculptor is better described by a two-population model than by a single-population model with a metallicity gradient. Moreover, given the assumptions of the current modeling, we find evidence of a third population, composed of few stars, that is more extended and metal-poor than the two other populations. This very metal-poor group of stars shows a shift of {\textasciitilde}15 km s-1 in its average line-of-sight velocity (vlos) with respect to the rest of the galaxy. We discuss several possible origins for this new population, finding a minor merger as the most likely one. We also find a vlos gradient of 4.0-1.5+1.5 km s-1 deg-1 but its statistical evidence is inconclusive and, moreover, its detection is partially driven by the group of stars with off-set velocities.},

  abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

  abstract = {The identification of sources driving cosmic reionization, a major phase transition from neutral hydrogen to ionized plasma around 600-800 Myr after the Big Bang1-3, has been a matter of debate4. Some models suggest that high ionizing emissivity and escape fractions (fesc) from quasars support their role in driving cosmic reionization5,6. Others propose that the high fesc values from bright galaxies generate sufficient ionizing radiation to drive this process7. Finally, a few studies suggest that the number density of faint galaxies, when combined with a stellar-mass-dependent model of ionizing efficiency and fesc, can effectively dominate cosmic reionization8,9. However, so far, comprehensive spectroscopic studies of low-mass galaxies have not been done because of their extreme faintness. Here we report an analysis of eight ultra-faint galaxies (in a very small field) during the epoch of reionization with absolute magnitudes between MUV {$\approx$} -17 mag and -15 mag (down to 0.005L{$\star$} (refs. 10,11)). We find that faint galaxies during the first thousand million years of the Universe produce ionizing photons with log[{$\xi$}ion (Hz erg-1)] = 25.80 {\textpm} 0.14, a factor of 4 higher than commonly assumed values12. If this field is representative of the large-scale distribution of faint galaxies, the rate of ionizing photons exceeds that needed for reionization, even for escape fractions of the order of 5\%.},

  abstract = {Chemical abundances of stellar streams can be used to determine the nature of a stream's progenitor. Here we study the progenitor of the recently discovered Leiptr stellar stream, which was previously suggested to be a tidally disrupted halo globular cluster. We obtain high-resolution spectra of five red giant branch stars selected from the Gaia DR2 STREAMFINDER catalog with Magellan/MIKE. One star is a clear non-member. The remaining four stars display chemical abundances consistent with those of a low-mass dwarf galaxy: they have a low mean metallicity, \${\textbackslash}langle\{{\textbackslash}rm[Fe/H]\}{\textbackslash}rangle = -2.2\$; they do not all have identical metallicities; and they display low [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] \${\textbackslash}sim 0\$ and [Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] \${\textbackslash}sim -1\$. This pattern of low \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and neutron-capture element abundances is only found in intact dwarf galaxies with stellar mass \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Although more data are needed to be certain, Leiptr's chemistry is consistent with being the lowest-mass dwarf galaxy stream without a known intact progenitor, possibly in the mass range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Leiptr thus preserves a record of one of the lowest-mass early accretion events into the Milky Way.},

We use high-resolution cosmological simulations to compare the effect of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) on dwarf galaxy structure for two different subgrid supernova (SN) feedback models, superbubble and blastwave, in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from 5000 {$<$} M */M {$\odot$} {$<$} 109. We find that in the "MARVEL-ous Dwarfs" suite both feedback models produce cored galaxies and reproduce observed scaling relations for luminosity, mass, and size. Our sample accurately predicts the average stellar metallicity at higher masses, however low-mass dwarfs are metal poor relative to observed galaxies in the Local Group. We show that continuous bursty star formation and the resulting stellar feedback are able to create dark matter (DM) cores in the higher dwarf galaxy mass regime, while the majority of ultrafaint and classical dwarfs retain cuspy central DM density profiles. We find that the effective core formation peaks at M */M halo {$\simeq$} 5 {\texttimes} 10-3 for both feedback models. Both subgrid SN models yield bursty SFHs at higher masses; however, galaxies simulated with superbubble feedback reach maximum mean burstiness values at lower stellar mass fractions relative to blastwave feedback. As a result, core formation may be better predicted by stellar mass fraction than the burstiness of SFHs.},

  abstract = {Recent photographs on red-sensitive plates, taken with the 100-inch telescope, have for the first time resolved into stars the two companions of the Andromeda nebula-Messier 32 and NGC 205-and the central region of the Andromeda nebula itself. The brightest stars in all three systems have the photo- graphic magnitude 21.3 and the mean color index +1.3 mag. Since the revised distance-modulus of the group is m - M = 22.4, the absolute photographic magnitude of the brightest stars in these systems is Mpg = -1.1. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the stars in the early-type nebulae is shown to be closely related to, if not identical with, that of the globular clusters. This leads to the further conclusion that the stellar populations of the galaxies fall into two distinct groups, one represented by the well-known H-R diagram of the stars in our solar neighborhood (the slow-moving stars), the other by that of the globular clusters. Characteristic of the first group (type I) are highly luminous 0- and B-type stars and open clusters; of the second (type II), short-period Cepheids and globular clusters. Early-type nebulae (E-Sa) seem to have populations of the pure type II. Both types seem to coexist in the intermediate and late-type nebulae. The two types of stellar populations had been recognized among the stars of our own galaxy by Oort as early as 1926},

The discovery was made through simple color-magnitude filters and visual inspection of the Y1A1 data. We refer to this new object as the Phoenix stream, after its resident constellation. After subtraction of the background stellar population we detect a clear signal of a simple stellar population. By fitting the ridge line of the stream in color-magnitude space, we find that a stellar population with age {$\tau$} = 11.5 {\textpm} 0.5 Gyr and [Fe/H] {$<$} -1.6, located 17.5 {\textpm} 0.9 kpc from the Sun, gives an adequate description of the stream stellar population. The stream is detected over an extension of 8.{$^\circ$}1 (2.5 kpc) and has a width of {$\sim$}54 pc assuming a Gaussian profile, indicating that a globular cluster (GC) is a probable progenitor. There is no known GC within 5 kpc that is compatible with being the progenitor of the stream, assuming that the stream traces its orbit. We examined overdensities (ODs) along the stream, however, no obvious counterpart-bound stellar system is visible in the coadded images. We also find ODs along the stream that appear to be symmetrically distributed---consistent with the epicyclic OD scenario for the formation of cold streams---as well as a misalignment between the northern and southern part of stream. Despite the close proximity we find no evidence that this stream and the halo cluster NGC 1261 have a common accretion origin linked to the recently found EriPhe OD.},

The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r {$<$} 19.4 mag over two-thirds and 19.8 mag over one-third of the area. The GSMF is determined from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method. This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density versus redshift. With H0= 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, the GSMF is well described between 108 and 1011.5 M{$\odot$} using a double Schechter function with ?, ?, {$\alpha$}1=-0.35, ? and {$\alpha$}2=-1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r {$<$} 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF below 108 M{$\odot$} is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low surface-brightness galaxies.},

This missing gravity problem may indicate a breakdown of GR at low accelerations, as postulated by Milgromian dynamics (MOND). We review the MOND theory and its consequences, including in a cosmological context where we advocate a hybrid approach involving light sterile neutrinos to address MOND's cluster-scale issues. We then test the novel predictions of MOND using evidence from galaxies, galaxy groups, galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the universe. We also consider whether the standard cosmological paradigm ({$\Lambda$}CDM) can explain the observations and review several previously published highly significant falsifications of it. Our overall assessment considers both the extent to which the data agree with each theory and how much flexibility each has when accommodating the data, with the gold standard being a clear a priori prediction not informed by the data in question. Our conclusion is that MOND is favoured by a wealth of data across a huge range of astrophysical scales, ranging from the kpc scales of galactic bars to the Gpc scale of the local supervoid and the Hubble tension, which is alleviated in MOND through enhanced cosmic variance. We also consider several future tests, mostly at scales much smaller than galaxies.},

  abstract = {The metallicity distribution function and internal chemical variations of a galaxy are fundamental to understand its formation and assembly history. In this work, we analyze photometric metallicities for 3883 stars over seven half-light radii (\${\textbackslash}rm r\_h\$) in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (Scl dSph) galaxy, using new narrow-band imaging data from the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey conducted with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the 4-m Blanco Telescope. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of MAGIC using the Scl dSph galaxy, one of the most well-studied satellites of the Milky Way. Our sample ranges from \${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}approx - 4.0\$ to \${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}approx - 0.6\$, includes six extremely metal-poor candidates (\${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}leq -3.0\$) without previous spectroscopic observations, and is almost three times larger than the largest spectroscopic metallicity dataset in the Scl dSph. Our spatially unbiased sample of metallicities provides a more accurate representation of the metallicity distribution function, revealing a more metal-rich peak than observed in the most recent spectroscopic sample. It also reveals a break in the metallicity gradient, with a strong change in the slope: from \$-3.35 {\textbackslash}pm 0.18 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} dex {\textbackslash}, deg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for stars inside \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm r\_h\$ to \$-0.56 {\textbackslash}pm 0.26 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} dex {\textbackslash}, deg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for the outer part of the Scl dSph. Our study demonstrates that combining photometric metallicity analysis with the wide field of view of DECam offers an efficient and unbiased approach for studying the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.},

  abstract = {Until recently the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N2, or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.},

We also use our kinematic data to measure the mass distribution within this system. By considering independently the kinematics of the two distinct stellar components known to be present in Scl, we are able to relieve known degeneracies and find that the observed velocity dispersion profiles are best fitted by a cored dark matter halo with core radius rc = 0.5 kpc and mass enclosed within the last measured point M({$<$}1.8 kpc) = (3.4 {\textpm} 0.7) {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$}, assuming an increasingly radially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid.

  abstract = {Aims: We perform a comprehensive determination of the systemic proper motions of 74 dwarf galaxies and dwarf galaxy candidates in the Local Group based on Gaia early data release 3. The outputs of the analysis for each galaxy, including probabilities of membership, will be made publicly available. The analysis is augmented by a determination of the orbital properties of galaxies within 500 kpc. Methods: We adopt a flexible Bayesian methodology presented in the literature, which takes into account the location of the stars on the sky, on the colour-magnitude diagram, and on the proper motion plane. We applied some modifications, in particular to the way the colour-magnitude diagram and spectroscopic information are factored in, for example, by including stars in several evolution phases. The bulk motions were integrated in three gravitational potentials: two where the Milky Way was treated in isolation and has a mass 0.9 \& 1.6 {\texttimes} 1012 M{$\odot$}, and a time-varying potential, which includes the infall of a massive Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Results: We were able to determine bulk proper motions for 73 systems, and we consider 66 to be reliable measurements. For the first time, systemic motions are presented for galaxies out to a distance of 1.4 Mpc in the NGC 3109 association. The inclusion of the infall of a massive LMC significantly modifies the orbital trajectories of the objects, with respect to orbit integration in static Milky-Way-only potentials, and this leads to six galaxies likely being associated with the LMC, three possibly being associated with it, and one recently captured object. We discuss the results of the orbit integration in the context of the relation of the galaxies to the system of Milky Way satellites, implications for the too-big-to-fail problem, the impact on star formation histories, and tidal disruption.

These are the most dark matter dominated galaxies, and as such may be considered ideal laboratories to test the current concordance cosmological model, and in particular provide constraints on the nature of the dominant form of dark matter. We discuss the latest observations of the kinematics of stars in these systems, and how these may be used to derive their mass distribution. We tour through the various dynamical techniques used, with emphasis on the complementarity and limitations, and discuss what the results imply also in the context of cosmological models. Finally we provide an outlook on exciting developments in this field.},

These dwarf galaxies are thus among the best astrophysical laboratories to study the structure of dark halos and the nature of dark matter. We review the properties of the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group from the point of view of stellar dynamics. After describing the observed kinematics of their stellar components and providing an overview of the dynamical modelling techniques, we look into the dark matter content and distribution of these galaxies, as inferred from the combination of observed data and dynamical models. We also briefly touch upon the prospects of using nearby dwarf galaxies as targets for indirect detection of dark matter via annihilation or decay emission.},

The maximum of the surface density is not found at our adopted center but in a ringlike structure some 13" from it. We identify this feature with the subclustering identified by Olszewski \& Aaronson, who believed that it was off-center. The currently accepted King's structural parameters, r\_c and r\_t, of Ursa Minor are found to be unsuitable to represent the stellar surface density near the center. Our star counts are used to obtain a lower limit of the central stellar density without the use of the velocity dispersion. We find a lower limit of 1.7+/-1.1 M\_solar pc{\textasciicircum}-3 from stars that were counted. By extrapolating the mass function to lower masses, we estimate that the true density could increase be a factor of 7.},

Low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) (1.5 \&lt; M/M{$\odot$} \&lt; 3) and massive (M \&gt; 10~M{$\odot$}) stars have been identified as the main site of the s-process. In this work we consider the evolution and nucleosynthesis of low-mass AGB stars. We provide an update of the NuGrid Set models, adopting the same general physics assumptions but using an updated convective-boundary-mixing model accounting for the contribution from internal gravity waves. The combined data set includes the initial masses MZAMS/M{$\odot$} = 2, 3 for Z =~0.03, 0.02, 0.01. These new models are computed with the mesa stellar code and the evolution is followed up to the end of the AGB phase. The nucleosynthesis was calculated for all isotopes in post-processing with the NuGrid mppnp code. The convective-boundary-mixing model leads to the formation of a 13C-pocket three times wider compared to the one obtained in the previous set of models, bringing the simulation results now in closer agreement with observations. Using these new models, we discuss the potential impact of other processes inducing mixing, like rotation, adopting parametric models compatible with theory and observations.

  abstract = {The slow neutron-capture process (s-process) efficiency in low-mass AGB stars (1.5 {$<$} M/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 3) critically depends on how mixing processes in stellar interiors are handled, which is still affected by considerable uncertainties. In this work, we compute the evolution and nucleosynthesis of low-mass AGB stars at low metallicities using the MESA stellar evolution code. The combined data set includes models with initial masses Mini/M{$\odot$}=2 and 3 for initial metallicities Z=0.001 and 0.002. The nucleosynthesis was calculated for all relevant isotopes by post-processing with the NuGrid mppnp code. Using these models, we show the impact of the uncertainties affecting the main mixing processes on heavy element nucleosynthesis, such as convection and mixing at convective boundaries. We finally compare our theoretical predictions with observed surface abundances on low-metallicity stars. We find that mixing at the interface between the He-intershell and the CO-core has a critical impact on the s-process at low metallicities, and its importance is comparable to convective boundary mixing processes under the convective envelope, which determine the formation and size of the 13C-pocket. Additionally, our results indicate that models with very low to no mixing below the He-intershell during thermal pulses, and with a 13C-pocket size of at least {$\sim$}3 {\texttimes} 10-4 M{$\odot$}, are strongly favored in reproducing observations.

The observations imply the presence of a significant amount of dark matter in the cluster core. In our dynamical simulations, neutron stars and/or massive white dwarfs concentrate to the center through mass segregation, resulting in a sharp increase in M/L toward the center. While consistent with the presence of a central black hole, the Hubble Space Telescope data can also be explained by this central concentration of stellar mass compact objects. The latter interpretation is more conservative, since such remnants result naturally from stellar evolution, although runaway merging leading to the formation of a black hole may also occur for some range of initial conditions. We conclude that no central massive object is required to explain the observational data, although we cannot conclusively exclude such an object at the level of {\textasciitilde}500-1000 Msolar. Our findings are unchanged when we reduce the assumed neutron star retention fraction in our simulations from 100\% to 0\%.},

Combining the velocity dispersion profiles derived here with new measurements of the internal mass functions allows us to model the internal kinematics of 144 clusters, more than 90~per\,cent of the currently known Galactic globular cluster population. We also derive the initial cluster masses by calculating the cluster orbits backwards in time applying suitable recipes to account for mass-loss and dynamical friction. We find a correlation between the stellar mass function of a globular cluster and the amount of mass lost from the cluster, pointing to dynamical evolution as one of the mechanisms shaping the mass function of stars in clusters. The mass functions also show strong evidence that globular clusters started with a bottom-light initial mass function. Our simulations show that the currently surviving globular cluster population has lost about 80~per\,cent of its mass since the time of formation. If globular clusters started from a lognormal mass function, we estimate that the Milky Way contained about 500 globular clusters initially, with a combined mass of about 2.5 {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$}. For a power-law initial mass function, the initial mass in globular clusters could have been a factor of three higher.},

We find that the amount of mass segregation in globular clusters is strongly correlated with their relaxation time and that all clusters with relaxation times of the order of their ages or longer have little to no mass segregation. For each cluster, the amount of mass segregation seen is fully compatible with the amount expected by dynamical evolution from initially unsegregated clusters, showing that globular clusters formed without primordial mass segregation among their low-mass stars. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxy candidates split into two groups, star clusters which follow the same trend between relaxation time and amount of mass segregation as globular clusters and dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies that are unsegregated despite having relaxation times smaller than a Hubble time. Stellar abundance and velocity dispersion data, where available, confirm our classification. After classification of the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy candidates, we find that outer halo star clusters have average densities inside their half-light radii of 0.03 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\rho$}h {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 M{$\odot$} pc-3, while dwarf galaxies have stellar densities of 0.001 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\rho$}h {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.03 M{$\odot$} pc-3. The reason for this separation in density is most likely a combination of the initial conditions by which the systems formed and the requirement to withstand external tidal forces.},

The velocity dispersion profiles were calculated based on a combination of more than 15000 high-precision radial velocities which we derived from archival ESO/VLT and Keck spectra together with {$\sim$}20000 published radial velocities from the literature. Our fits also include the stellar mass functions of the globular clusters, which are available for 47 clusters in our sample, allowing us to self-consistently take the effects of mass segregation and ongoing cluster dissolution into account. We confirm the strong correlation between the global mass functions of globular clusters and their relaxation times recently found by Sollima \& Baumgardt (2017). We also find a correlation of the escape velocity from the centre of a globular cluster and the fraction of first generation stars (FG) in the cluster recently derived for 57 globular clusters by Milone et al. (2017), but no correlation between the FG star fraction and the global mass function of a globular cluster. This could indicate that the ability of a globular cluster to keep the wind ejecta from the polluting star(s) is the crucial parameter determining the presence and fraction of second-generation stars and not its later dynamical mass loss.},

Strong P Cygni lines and He II {$\lambda$}1640 emission indicate a significant population of Wolf-Rayet stars, but synthetic spectra of individual populations of young, hot stars do not reproduce the observed integrated P Cygni absorption features. The rest-frame UV spectral features are indicative of a young starburst with high ionization, implying either (1) an ionization parameter significantly higher than suggested by rest-frame optical nebular lines, or (2) differences in one or both of the initial mass function and the properties of ionizing spectra of massive stars. We argue that the observed features are likely the result of a superposition of star forming regions with different physical properties. These results demonstrate the complexity of star formation on scales smaller than individual galaxies, and highlight the importance of systematic effects that result from smearing together the signatures of individual star forming regions within galaxies.

This paper compares differential rotation measurements from four techniques: Doppler shift, Doppler feature tracking, magnetic feature tracking, and p-mode splittings. The different rotation rates measured by the first three techniques are interpreted as rotation rates of solar phenomena which depend on the properties and depth of that which is measured. This interpretation is supported by comparison with rotation measurements obtained from p-mode splittings except for Doppler features. The rotation rate of the plasma corresponds to the surface rate obtained by inversions; the rates of magnetic features correspond to the rotation rate at various depths within the convection zone. Supergranulation rotates at a rate greater than the maximum rotation rate within the convection zone, suggesting that supergranules are not simple convection cells anchored at a particular depth.},

  abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellar mass-halo mass (SM-HM) relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We provide a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation for 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 1 and discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z = 0 to z = 4. The shape and the evolution are well constrained for z {$<$} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates (0.25 dex uncertainty in normalization); however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z = 4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. We find that the integrated star formation at a given halo mass peaks at 10\%-20\% of available baryons for all redshifts from 0 to 4. This peak occurs at a halo mass of 7 {\texttimes} 1011 M sun at z = 0 and this mass increases by a factor of 5 to z = 4. At lower and higher masses, star formation is substantially less efficient, with stellar mass scaling as M * {\textasciitilde} M 2.3 h at low masses and M * {\textasciitilde} M 0.29 h at high masses. The typical stellar mass for halos with mass less than 1012 M sun has increased by 0.3-0.45 dex for halos since z {\textasciitilde} 1. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models.},

  abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8\% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe {\textohm}*h=2.0+/-0.6{\texttimes}10-3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

  abstract = {We present (V, I) photometry of two wide ({\textasciitilde}=25{\texttimes}25 arcmin2) fields centered on the low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxies Draco and Ursa Minor. New estimates of the distance to these galaxies are provided [(m-M)0(UMi)=19.41+/-0.12 and (m-M)0(Dra)=19.84+/-0.14], and a comparative study of their evolved stellar population is presented. We detect for the first time the red giant branch (RGB) bump in the luminosity function of UMi (VbumpRGB=19.40+/-0.06), while the feature is not detected in Draco. Photometric metallicity distributions are obtained for the two galaxies, and an accurate analysis to determine the intrinsic metallicity spread is performed by means of artificial star experiments. The adopted method is insensitive to stars more metal poor than [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-2.5, and it rests on the assumption that the age spread in the considered populations is small (i.e., the impact of the actual age spread on the colors of the RGB stars is negligible). We find that while the average metallicity of the two galaxies is similar ({$<$}[Fe/H]{$>$}UMi=-1.8 and Dra=-1.7), the metallicity distributions are significantly different, having different peak values ([Fe/H]modUMi=-1.9 and [Fe/H]modDra=-1.6) and different maximum metallicities. We suggest that such differences may be partly responsible for the difference in horizontal-branch morphology between the two galaxies. The intrinsic metallicity 1 {$\sigma$} spread is {$\sigma$}i=0.10 in UMi and {$\sigma$}i=0.13 in Draco. We demonstrate that the inner region of UMi is significantly structured, at odds with what is expected for a system in dynamical equilibrium. In particular, we show that the main density peak of UMi is off-center with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and shows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy. Moreover, UMi stars are shown to be clustered according to two different characteristic clustering scales, as opposed to Draco, which instead has a very symmetric and smooth density profile. The possible consequences of this striking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are briefly discussed. Combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of the total luminosity of UMi, we find that the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of this galaxy may be as low as M/L{\textasciitilde}7, a factor of 5-10 lower than current estimates.

We find that a number of simulated dwarfs form `outside-in', with an old, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentrated metal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like Sculptor or Sextans. We focus on a few examples where stars form in two populations distinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. The spatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; the old stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young population forms largely in situ. The older component results from a first episode of star formation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects of stellar feedback and reionization. The younger component forms when a late accretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. The effect of mergers is to disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasing their central density relative to the young population. We argue that dwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systems with multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {The vertical structure and dynamics of stars in our local Galactic neighbourhood contains much information about the local distribution of visible and dark matter and of perturbations to the Milky Way disc. We use data on the positions and velocities of stars in the solar neighbourhood from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and large spectroscopic surveys to investigate the vertical number counts and mean velocity trend as a function of distance from the local Galactic mid-plane. We perform a detailed measurement of the wave-like north-south asymmetry in the vertical number counts, which reveals a number of deficits at heights {$\approx$}0.4, {$\approx$}0.9, and \{{$\approx$} \} 1.5 kpc, and peaks at {$\approx$}0.2, {$\approx$}0.7, and \{{$\approx$} \} 1.1 kpc. We find that the asymmetry pattern is independent of colour. The mean vertical velocity is almost constant to {$<$} 1 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} within a few 100 pc from the mid-plane and then displays a north-south symmetric dip at \{{$\approx$} \}0.5 kpc with an amplitude of \{{$\approx$} \} 2 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} that is a plausible velocity counterpart to the main number count dip at a similar height. Thus, with Gaia DR2 we confirm at high fidelity that the local Galactic disc is undergoing a wave-like oscillation and a dynamically consistent observational picture of the perturbed local vertical structure emerges for the first time. We also present the most precise and accurate determination of the Sun's height above the local Galactic mid-plane, correcting for any asymmetry in the vertical density: z\_\{{$\odot$}\} = 20.8 {\textpm} 0.3 pc.},

At low metallicities, (12+log(O/H) {$<$} 8.0), nebular carbon measurements are limited to rest-frame UV collisionally excited emission lines. Therefore, we present the UV spectrophotometry of 12 nearby low-metallicity high-ionization H II regions in dwarf galaxies obtained using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We present the first analysis of the C/O ratio in local galaxies based solely on simultaneous significant detections of the UV \{\{\{O\}\}\}+2 and \{\{\{C\}\}\}+2 collisionally excited lines in seven of our targets and five objects from the literature to create a final sample of 12 significant detections. Our sample is complemented by optical SDSS spectra, from which we measured the nebular physical conditions and oxygen abundances using the direct method. At low metallicity, (12+log(O/H) {$<$} 8.0), no clear trend is evident in C/O versus O/H for the present sample given the large dispersion observed. When combined with recombination line observations at higher values of O/H, a general trend of increasing C/O with increasing O/H is also viable but with some significant outliers. Additionally, we find the C/N ratio appears to be constant (but with significant scatter) over a large range in oxygen abundance, indicating that carbon is predominantly produced by similar nucleosynthetic mechanisms as nitrogen. If true, and our current understanding of nitrogen production is correct, this would indicate that primary production of carbon (a flat trend) dominates at low metallicity, but quasi-secondary production (an increasing trend) becomes prominent at higher metallicities. A larger sample will be needed to determine the true nature and dispersion of the relation.},

SL2S0217 is a low-mass (M {$<$} 109 M {$\odot$}), low-metallicity (Z {$\sim$} 1/20 Z {$\odot$}) galaxy, with extreme star-forming conditions that produce strong nebular UV emission lines in the absence of any apparent outflows. Here we present several notable features from rest-frame UV Keck/LRIS spectroscopy: (1) Very strong narrow emission lines are measured for C IV {$\lambda\lambda$}1548, 1550, He II {$\lambda$}1640, O III] {$\lambda\lambda$}1661, 1666, Si III] {$\lambda\lambda$}1883, 1892, and C III] {$\lambda\lambda$}1907, 1909. (2) Double-peaked Ly{$\alpha$} emission is observed with a dominant blue peak and centered near the systemic velocity. (3) The low- and high-ionization absorption features indicate very little or no outflowing gas along the sight line to the lensed galaxy. The relative emission-line strengths can be reproduced with a very high ionization, low-metallicity starburst with binaries, with the exception of He II, which indicates that an additional ionization source is needed. We rule out large contributions from active galactic nuclei and shocks to the photoionization budget, suggesting that the emission features requiring the hardest radiation field likely result from extreme stellar populations that are beyond the capabilities of current models. Therefore, SL2S0217 serves as a template for the extreme conditions that are important for reionization and thought to be more common in the early universe.},

  abstract = {Aims: We present a detailed and uniform study of oxygen abundance from two different oxygen lines at 6158 {\AA} and 6300 {\AA} in a large sample of solar-type stars. The results are used to check the behaviour of these spectral lines as oxygen abundance indicators and to study the evolution of oxygen in thick and thin disk populations of the Galaxy. Methods: Equivalent width measurements were carried out for the [OI] 6158 {\AA} and OI 6300 {\AA} lines. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundances were obtained from these two lines in 610 and 535 stars, respectively. We were able to measure oxygen abundance from both indicators in 447 stars enabling us for the first time to compare them in a uniform way. Careful error analysis has been performed. Results: We found that oxygen abundances derived from the 6158 {\AA} and 6300 {\AA} lines agree to within 0.1 dex in 58\% of the stars in our sample, and this result improves for higher signal-to-noise values. We confirm an oxygen enhancement in stars of the thick disk, as has also been seen for other {$\alpha$}-elements. The new oxygen abundances confirm previous findings for a progressive linear rise in the oxygen-to-iron ratio with a slope equal to 0.78 from solar metallicity to [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1. However, the slope we measured is steeper than the one found in previous studies based on the oxygen triplet. Below [Fe/H] = -0.6 our stars show [O/Fe] ratios as high as {\textasciitilde}0.8, which can be interpreted as evidence for oxygen overproduction in the Galactic thick disk. These high oxygen abundances do not pose a problem to chemodynamical models since there is a range of parameters that can accommodate our results.

  abstract = {We present the first results of an extensive photographic surface photometry of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster. The mean radial surface brightness (SB) profiles of 174dE, 20 dS0, 24E \& S0 and 7Sa galaxies are surveyed morphologically and analyzed by fitting model profiles. The main relationships found, and their interpretation, are as follows: 1. Faint dwarfs are very well described by an exponential or a King model profile. Brightward of M\_B\_{\textasciitilde} - 16, the observed profiles are increasingly brighter in the central 1 to 3 kpc than either model fit predicts. These extended SB excesses should not be confused with the nuclei; nor with E-like bulges. 2. The magnitudes of the nuclei vary greatly at a given galaxian magnitude, but the maximum nuclear luminosity is a strong function of MT. The luminosity function of the nuclei is consistent with that of the globular clusters of M 87. 3. In the radius range 0.1 to 1 kpc, the logarithmically plotted profiles of all early-type galaxies come in two well-distinct classes which we identify with classical types versus dwarf types. The former are all classified E or S0. The latter comprise all galaxies classified dE or dSO; all morphologically "intermediate" types (d: E), and even two (mis-) classified "E"s. There are no true intermediate types between E and dE. The classical-dwarf dichotomy appears strongest in the King core parameter diagrams, but it is basically model-independent. There conditions for early mass loss by galactic winds must have been very critical. The bright dwarfs may have built up their bulge-like SB excess by secondary (late) star formation. 4. The mean SB profiles of dSO galaxies are indistinguishable from bright dE profiles. Two-dimensionally, the dS0s appear highly flattened and/or show asymmetric \& irregular features, which may indicate their disk nature. Several arguments suggest that many (if not most) bright dwarfs may be rotationally supported disk galaxies, while most faint dwarfs may be spheroidals (supported by random motions). The transition at M\_B\_{\textasciitilde}-16 may reflect a critical mass for the formation or stability of stellar disks.},

The stability of these configurations and the theory of spiral structures are discussed. Collisions and encounters between stellar systems are considered, and two-body realization and the approach to statistical equilibrium in star clusters are addressed. It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their constituent stellar populations. Finally, it is shown that most of the mass in the universe is locked up in some still invisible form.},

Mass loss has been taken into account with different descriptions for the RGB, AGB and post-AGB phase. On the AGB we considered mass loss with a formula based on dynamical calculations of the atmospheres of Mira-like stars. Our results are consistent with empirical initial-final mass relations. It is shown that hot bottom burning and mass loss are closely connected. The overluminosity as well as the nucleosynthesis of hot bottom burning models can depend sensitively on mass loss. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of mass loss on the internal structure reached at the tip of the AGB, and emphasize that post-AGB timescales will depend strongly on the AGB history, i.e. on the initial mass and the applied mass-loss law.},

An attractive feature of this cold dark matter hypothesis is its considerable predictive power: the post-recombination fluctuation spectrum is calculable, and it in turn governs the formation of galaxies and clusters. Good agreement with the data is obtained for a Zeldovich ({\textbar}{$\delta$}k{\textbar}2 {$\propto$} k) spectrum of primordial fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Varied evidence suggests that galaxies consist of roughly 10 percent baryonic matter by mass and that baryons sink dissipatively by about a factor of 10 in. radius during galaxy formation. It is shown that such infall strongly perturbs the underlying dark matter distribution, pulling it inward and creating cores that are considerably smaller and denser than would have evolved without dissipation. Any discontinuity between the baryonic and dark matter mass distributions is smoothed out by the coupled motions of the two components. If dark halos have large core radii in the absence of dissipation, the above infall scenario yields rotation curves that are flat over large distances, in agreement with observations of spiral galaxies. Such large dissipationless cores may plausibly result from large internal kinetic energy in protogalaxies at maximum expansion, perhaps as a result of subclustering, tidal effects, or anisotropic collapse.},

The limit to sensitivity will be set by thermal emission from the zodiacal light particles near the Earth's orbit unless the interferometer is launched out of the ecliptic or out to the orbit of Jupiter, in which case instrumental limitations will dominate.

I show how wind accretion in a binary system is different from the usually assumed Bondi--Hoyle approximation, first as far as the flow's structure is concerned, but most importantly, also for the mass accretion and specific angular momentum loss. This has important implications on the evolution of the orbital parameters. I also discuss the impact of wind accretion, on the chemical pollution and change in spin of the accreting star. The last section deals with observations and covers systems that most likely went through wind mass transfer: barium and related stars, symbiotic stars and central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN). The most recent observations of cool CSPN progenitors of barium stars, as well as of carbon-rich post-common envelope systems, are providing unique constraints on the mass transfer processes.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical model of galaxy formation predicts that the Milky Way halo is populated by tidal debris of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. Due to long dynamical times, debris from the lowest mass objects remains coherent as thin and dynamically cold stellar streams for billions of years. The Gaia mission, providing astrometry and spectrophotometry for billions of stars, has brought three fundamental changes to our view of cold stellar streams in the Milky Way. First, more than a hundred stellar streams have been discovered and characterized using Gaia data. This is an order of magnitude increase in the number of well-measured streams, thanks to Gaia's capacity for identifying comoving groups of stars among the field Milky Way population. Second, Gaia data have revealed that density variations both along and across stellar streams are common. Dark-matter subhalos, as well as baryonic structures were theoretically predicted to form such features, but observational evidence for density variations was uncertain before Gaia. Third, stream kinematics are now widely available and have constrained the streams' orbits and origins. Gaia has not only provided proper motions directly, but also enabled efficient spectroscopic follow-up of the proper-motion selected targets. These discoveries have established stellar streams as a dense web of sensitive gravitational tracers in the Milky Way halo. We expect the coming decade to bring a full mapping of the Galactic population of stellar streams, as well as develop numerical models that accurately explain their evolution within the Milky Way for a variety of cosmological models. Perhaps most excitingly, the comparison between the two will be able to reveal the presence of dark-matter subhalos below the threshold for galaxy formation ({$\lessequivlnt$}106M{$\odot$}), and provide the most stringent test of the cold dark matter paradigm on small scales.},

  abstract = {The dark matter content of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy inferred from its kinematics is substantially lower than expected from LCDM cosmological simulations. We use N-body simulations to examine whether this may be the result of Galactic tides. We find that, despite improved proper motions from the Gaia mission, the pericentric distance of Fornax remains poorly constrained, mainly because its largest velocity component is roughly antiparallel to the solar motion. Translating Fornax's proper motion into a Galactocentric velocity is, thus, sensitively dependent on Fornax's assumed distance: the observed distance uncertainty, \${\textbackslash}pm 8{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$, implies pericentric distances that vary between rperi {\textasciitilde} 50 and {\textasciitilde}150 kpc. Our simulations show that for rperi in the lower range of that estimate, an LCDM subhalo with maximum circular velocity Vmax = 40 km s-1 (or virial mass \$M\_\{200\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, as expected from LCDM) would be tidally stripped to Vmax {\textasciitilde} 23 km s-1 over 10 Gyr. This would reduce the dark mass within the Fornax stellar half-mass radius to about half its initial value, bringing it into agreement with observations. Tidal stripping affects mainly Fornax's dark matter halo; its stellar component is affected little, losing less than \$5{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$ of its initial mass in the process. We also explore the effect of Galactic tides on the dynamical friction decay times of Fornax's population of globular clusters (GCs) and find little evidence for substantial changes, compared with models run in isolation. A population of GCs with initial orbital radii between 1 and 2 kpc is consistent with the present-day spatial distribution of Fornax GCs, despite assuming a cuspy halo. Neither the dark matter content nor the spatial distribution of GCs of Fornax seems inconsistent with a simple model where Fornax inhabits a tidally stripped cuspy cold dark matter halo.},

  abstract = {The unusually low velocity dispersion and large size of Crater II pose a challenge to our understanding of dwarf galaxies in the Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmogony. The low velocity dispersion suggests either a dark halo mass much lower than the minimum expected from hydrogen cooling limit arguments or one that is in the late stages of extreme tidal stripping. The tidal interpretation has been favoured in recent work and is supported by the small pericentric distances consistent with available kinematic estimates. We use N-body simulations to examine this interpretation in detail, assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for Crater II's progenitor halo. Our main finding is that, although the low velocity dispersion can indeed result from the effect of tides, the large size of Crater II is inconsistent with this hypothesis. This is because galaxies stripped to match the observed velocity dispersion are also reduced to sizes much smaller than the observed half-light radius of Crater II. Unless its size has been substantially overestimated, reconciling this system with LCDM requires that either (i) it is not bound and near equilibrium (unlikely, given its crossing time is shorter than the time elapsed since pericentre) or (ii) its progenitor halo deviates from the assumed NFW profile. The latter alternative may signal that baryons can affect the inner halo cusp even in extremely faint dwarfs or, more intriguingly, may signal effects associated with the intimate nature of the dark matter, such as finite self-interactions, or other such deviations from the canonical LCDM paradigm.},

  abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies populate the faintest end of the galaxy luminosity function and yet they apparently reside in massive dark matter halos. With mass-to-light ratios as high as M/L {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}4 , they are the key to understanding the nature of dark matter on galactic scales. Of particular interest are nearby dwarf spheroidals that appear at odds with predictions from LCDM, the standard model of cosmological structure formation. These are galaxies which exhibit unusually large sizes and low line-of-sight velocity dispersions, suggestive of surprisingly underdense dark matter halos, perhaps occurring as a result of tidal interactions with the Milky Way.     In this dissertation I present a detailed study of three carefully selected such cases: the Fornax, Crater II and Antlia II dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way. Fornax is chosen for its relatively low mass-to-light ratio, which is suggestive of a lower mass halo than indicated by abundance matching. Crater II and Antlia II, termed `feeble giants', are both chosen for their particularly low values of velocity dispersion, which are especially anomalous given their large half-light radii and low luminosities. Using N-body simulations, we investigate the evolution of these objects under the effects of Galactic tides imparted by the Milky Way potential.    Our study leads us to conclude that the low measured velocity dispersions of these dwarf galaxies are indeed consistent with a tidal interpretation in the context of predictions put forth by cosmological simulations of the Local Group and recent measurements of the galaxies' sky positions, proper motions, distances, and radial velocities. The large sizes of Crater II and Antlia II are much more difficult to reconcile in this scenario, however these are still possible to reproduce under the effect of Galactic tides, provided that initially the stellar binding energy distributions had a minimum ``cutoff''. Such a limit, which may have been imposed by baryonic effects during the formation of the galaxy, or by the presence of a constant density dark matter core, leads to transient stages with large sizes and low velocity dispersions comparable to those of Crater II and Antlia II. Detailed observations of galaxies' density profiles, corresponding logarithmic slopes, and velocity dispersion profiles may help provide insight into the likelihood of such a formation scenario for Crater II, Antlia II, and the emerging population of other feeble giant galaxies.},

  abstract = {I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions, objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits, integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials, and making use of a recent general approximation for any static potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also included in the current release; currently, these consist of two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail. Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of documentation. The test suite covers 99.6\% of the code. galpy is available at http://github.com/jobovy/galpy with extensive documentation available at http://galpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest.},

  abstract = {We have developed spherically symmetric dynamical models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies using Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method. This type of modelling yields constraints both on the total mass distribution (e.g. enclosed mass and scale radius) and on the orbital structure of the system (e.g. velocity anisotropy). This method is thus less prone to biases introduced by assumptions in comparison to the more commonly used Jeans modelling, and it allows us to put reliable constraints on their dark matter content. Here we present our results for the Sculptor dSph galaxy, after testing our methods on mock data sets. We fit both the second and fourth velocity moment profiles to break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. For an Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) dark matter halo profile, we find that the mass of Sculptor within 1 kpc is M1 kpc = (1.03 {\textpm} 0.07) {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$}, and that its velocity anisotropy profile is tangentially biased and nearly constant for radii beyond {$\sim$}100 pc. The preferred concentration (c {$\sim$} 15) is low for its dark matter mass but consistent within the scatter found in N-body cosmological simulations. When we let the value of the central logarithmic slope {$\alpha$} vary, we find that the best-fitting model has {$\alpha$} = 0, although an NFW cusp or shallower is consistent at the 1{$\sigma$} confidence level. On the other hand, very cuspy density profiles with logarithmic central slopes {$\alpha$} {$<$} -1.5 are strongly disfavoured for Sculptor.},

Nonetheless, from the combined evidence, we find that is unlikely that all galaxies are embedded in the same type of cored profiles of the form {$\rho$}DM {$\propto$} 1/(1 + r2){$\beta$}/2, where {$\beta$} = 3,4. For each galaxy, we also obtain an almost model independent, and therefore accurate, constraint on the logarithmic slope of the dark matter density distribution at a radius {\textasciitilde}r-3, i.e. where the logarithmic slope of the stellar density profile is -3. Conclusions: For each galaxy, we find that all best fit models essentially have the same mass distribution over a large range in radius (from just below r-3 to the last measured data point). This remarkable finding likely implies much stronger constraints on the characteristics that subhalos extracted from cosmological simulations should have in order to host the dSph galaxies around the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {The Sun provides the principal energy input into the Earth system and solar variability represents a significant external climate forcing. Although observations of solar activity (sunspots) cover only the last about 400\,years, radionuclides produced by cosmic rays and stored in tree rings or ice cores serve as proxies for solar activity extending back thousands of years. However, the presence of weather-induced noise or low temporal resolution of long, precisely dated records hampers cosmogenic nuclide-based studies of short-term solar variability such as the 11-yr Schwabe cycle. Here we present a continuous, annually resolved atmospheric 14C concentration (fractionation-corrected ratio of 14CO2 to CO2) record reconstructed from absolutely dated tree rings covering nearly all of the last millennium (ad 969--1933). The high-resolution and precision 14C record reveals the presence of the Schwabe cycle over the entire time range. The record confirms the ad 993 solar energetic particle event and reveals two new candidates (ad 1052 and ad 1279), indicating that strong solar events that might be harmful to modern electronic systems probably occur more frequently than previously thought. In addition to showing decadal-scale solar variability over the last millennium, the high-temporal-resolution record of atmospheric radiocarbon also provides a useful benchmark for making radiocarbon dating more accurate over this interval.},

  abstract = {We present a catalog of uniformly determined stellar properties and abundances for 1,617 F, G, and K stars using an automated spectral synthesis modeling procedure. All stars were observed using the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Our procedure used a single line list to fit model spectra to observations of all stars to determine effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, projected rotational velocity, and the abundances of 15 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Y). Sixty percent of the sample had Hipparcos parallaxes and V-band photometry, which we combined with the spectroscopic results to obtain mass, radius, and luminosity. Additionally, we used the luminosity, effective temperature, metallicity and {$\alpha$}-element enhancement to interpolate in the Yonsei-Yale isochrones to derive mass, radius, gravity, and age ranges for those stars. Finally, we determined new relations between effective temperature and macroturbulence for dwarfs and subgiants. Our analysis achieved precisions of 25 K in \{T\}\{eff\}, 0.01 dex in [M/H], 0.028 dex for \{log\}g, and 0.5 km s-1 in v{\textbackslash}sin I based on multiple observations of the same stars. The abundance results were similarly precise, between {$\sim$}0.01 and {$\sim$}0.04 dex, though trends with respect to \{T\}\{eff\} remained for which we derived empirical corrections. The trends, though small, were much larger than our uncertainties and are shared with published abundances. We show that changing our model atmosphere grid accounts for most of the trend in [M/H] between 5000 and 5500 K, indicating a possible problem with the atmosphere models or opacities.},

  abstract = {Many of the short-lived radioactive nuclei that were present in the early solar system can be produced in massive stars. In the first paper in this series, we focused on the production of 26Al in massive binaries. In our second paper, we considered rotating single stars; two more short-lived radioactive nuclei, 36Cl and 41Ca; and the comparison to the early solar system data. In this work, we update our previous conclusions by further considering the impact of binary interactions. We used the MESA stellar evolution code with an extended nuclear network to compute massive (10-80 M {$\odot$}), binary stars at various initial periods and solar metallicity (Z = 0.014), up to the onset of core collapse. The early solar system abundances of 26Al and 41Ca can be matched self-consistently by models with initial masses {$\geq$}25 M {$\odot$}, while models with initial primary masses {$\geq$}35 M {$\odot$} can also match 36Cl. Almost none of the models provide positive net yields for 19F, while for 22Ne the net yields are positive from 30 M {$\odot$} and higher. This leads to an increase by a factor of approximately 4 in the amount of 22Ne produced by a stellar population of binary stars, relative to single stars. In addition, besides the impact on the stellar yields, our 10 M {$\odot$} primary star undergoing Case A mass transfer ends its life as a white dwarf instead of as a core-collapse supernova. This demonstrates that binary interactions can also strongly impact the evolution of stars close to the supernova boundary.},

  abstract = {We investigate the non-adiabatic effect of time-dependent deformations in the Milky Way (MW) halo potential on stellar streams. Specifically, we consider the MW's response to the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and how this impacts our ability to recover the spherically averaged MW mass profile from observation using stream actions. Previously, action clustering methods have only been applied to static or adiabatic MW systems to constrain the properties of the host system. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions. We find that for streams with realistic observational uncertainties on shorter orbital periods and without close encounters with the LMC, e.g. GD-1, the radial action distribution is sufficiently clustered to locally recover the MW mass profile across the stream radial range within a 2 sigma confidence interval determined using a Fisher information approach. For streams with longer orbital periods and close encounters with the LMC, e.g. Orphan-Chenab (OC), the radial action distribution disperses as the MW halo has deformed non-adiabatically. Hence, for OC streams generated in potentials that include a MW halo with any deformations, action clustering methods will fail to recover the mass profile within a 2 sigma uncertainty. Finally, we investigate whether the clustering of stream energies can provide similar constraints. Surprisingly, we find for OC-like streams, the recovered spherically averaged mass profiles demonstrate less sensitivity to the time-dependent deformations in the potential.},

  abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky Way (MW) mass galaxies that include both baryons and dark matter (DM) to show that baryonic physics (energetic feedback from supernovae and subsequent tidal stripping) significantly reduces the DM mass in the central regions of luminous satellite galaxies. The reduced central masses of the simulated satellites reproduce the observed internal dynamics of MW and M31 satellites as a function of luminosity. We use these realistic satellites to update predictions for the observed velocity and luminosity functions of satellites around MW-mass galaxies when baryonic effects are accounted for. We also predict that field dwarf galaxies in the same luminosity range as the MW classical satellites should not exhibit velocities as low as the satellites because the field dwarfs do not experience tidal stripping. Additionally, the early formation times of the satellites compared to field galaxies at the same luminosity may be apparent in the star formation histories of the two populations. Including baryonic physics in cold dark matter (CDM) models naturally explains the observed low DM densities in the MWs dwarf spheroidal population. Our simulations therefore resolve the tension between kinematics predicted in CDM theory and observations of satellites, without invoking alternative forms of DM.},

The core-collapse simulations are carried out in 2D to nearly 3 s postbounce and show substantial differences in the times of shock revival and explosion energies. The 15.78 M {$\Sun$} model begins exploding promptly at 120 ms postbounce when a strong density decrement at the Si-Si/O shell interface, not present in the 15.79 M {$\Sun$} progenitor, encounters the stalled shock. The 15.79 M {$\Sun$} model takes 100 ms longer to explode but ultimately produces a more powerful explosion. Both the larger mass accretion rate and the more massive core of the 15.79 M {$\Sun$} model during the first 0.8 s postbounce time result in larger {$\nu$} e / \$\{{\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}nu \}\}\_\{e\}\$ luminosities and RMS energies along with a flatter and higher-density heating region. The more-energetic explosion of the 15.79 M {$\Sun$} model resulted in the ejection of twice as much 56Ni. Most of the ejecta in both models are moderately proton rich, though counterintuitively the highest electron fraction (Y e = 0.61) ejecta in either model are in the less-energetic 15.78 M {$\Sun$} model, while the lowest electron fraction (Y e = 0.45) ejecta in either model are in the 15.79 M {$\Sun$} model.},

  abstract = {The Milky Way's (MW) stellar disc exhibits a bimodality in the [Fe/H] versus [{$\alpha$}/Fe] plane, showing a distinct high- and low-{$\alpha$} sequences whose origin is still under debate. We examine the [Fe/H]-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance plane in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of MW-like galaxies from the NIHAO-UHD project and show that the bimodal {$\alpha$}-sequence is a generic consequence of a gas-rich merger at some time in the Galaxy's evolution. The high-{$\alpha$} sequence evolves first in the early galaxies, extending to high metallicities, while it is the low-{$\alpha$} sequence that is formed after the gas-rich merger. The merger brings in fresh metal-poor gas diluting the interstellar medium's metallicity while keeping the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] abundance almost unchanged. The kinematic, structural, and spatial properties of the bimodal {$\alpha$}-sequence in our simulations reproduces that of observations. In all simulations, the high-{$\alpha$} disc is old, radially concentrated towards the galaxy's centre and shows large scale heights. In contrast, the low-{$\alpha$} disc is younger, more radially extended and concentrated to the disc mid-plane. Our results show that the abundance plane is well described by these two populations that have been distributed radially across the disc by migration: at present day in the solar neighbourhood, low-{$\alpha$} stars originate from both the inner and outer discs, while most of the high-{$\alpha$} stars have migrated from the inner disc. We show that age dating the stars in the [Fe/H]-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] plane can constrain the time of the low-{$\alpha$} sequence forming merger and conclude that {$\alpha$}-bimodality is likely a not uncommon feature of disc galaxies.},

We break spectroscopic degeneracies in our spectrum analysis with astrometry from Gaia~DR2 and photometry from 2MASS. We report abundance ratios [X/Fe] for 30 different elements (11 of which are based on non-LTE computations) covering five nucleosynthetic pathways. We describe validations for accuracy and precision, flagging of peculiar stars/measurements and recommendations for using our results. Our catalogue comprises 65~per~cent dwarfs, 34~per~cent giants, and 1~per~cent other/unclassified stars. Based on unflagged chemical composition and age, we find 62~per~cent young low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, 9~per~cent young high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, 27~per~cent old high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, and 2~per~cent stars with [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -1.

This corresponds to rs(z){\textasciitilde}constant, and is contrary to earlier suspicions that cvir does not vary much with redshift. The implications are that high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer than expected before. Secondly, we find that the scatter in halo profiles is large, with a 1{$\sigma$} {$\Delta$}(logcvir)=0.18 at a given mass, corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of {$\Delta$}VmaxVmax=0.12. We discuss implications for modelling the Tully-Fisher relation, which has a smaller reported intrinsic scatter. Thirdly, subhaloes and haloes in dense environments tend to be more concentrated than isolated haloes, and show a larger scatter. These results suggest that cvir is an essential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discuss implications for the universality of the Tully-Fisher relation, the formation of low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the Hubble sequence. We present an improved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relations between halo parameters and their redshift dependence, and can thus serve semi-analytic studies of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than {$\sim$}1 Mpc and mass scales smaller than {$\sim$}1011M{$\odot$}, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter-dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than na{\"i}vely predicted in {$\Lambda$}CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with {$\Lambda$}CDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of {$\Lambda$}CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

  abstract = {If the favored hierarchical cosmological model is correct, then the Milky Way system should have accreted {\textasciitilde}100-200 luminous satellite galaxies in the past {\textasciitilde}12 Gyr. We model this process using a hybrid semianalytic plus N-body approach that distinguishes explicitly between the evolution of light and dark matter in accreted satellites. This distinction is essential to our ability to produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the observed number counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Our accreted stellar halos have density profiles that typically drop off with radius faster than the dark matter and follow power laws at r{$>$}{\textasciitilde}30 kpc with {$\rho$}{\textasciitilde}r-{$\alpha$}, {$\alpha$}{\textasciitilde}=3-4. They are well fit by Hernquist profiles over the full radial range. We find that stellar halos are assembled from the inside out, with the majority of mass ({\textasciitilde}80\%) coming from the {\textasciitilde}15 most massive accretion events. The satellites that contribute to the stellar halo have median accretion times of {\textasciitilde}9 Gyr in the past, while surviving satellite systems have median accretion times of {\textasciitilde}5 Gyr in the past. This implies that stars associated with the inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in surviving satellites and also from stars in the outer halo or those liberated in recent disruption events. We briefly discuss the expected spatial structure and phase-space structure for halos formed in this manner. Searches for this type of structure offer a direct test of whether cosmology is indeed hierarchical on small scales.},

Sextans has a cutoff radius that is equal to the expected tidal radius, assuming a high mass-to-light ratio. This satellite very likely is dark matter-dominated. Carina, Ursa Minor, and Draco, on the other hand, cannot contain a dominating dark matter component if the observed ``extratidal'' stars are located exterior to the tidal radii of these systems. The evidence for tidal stripping in the absence of dark matter is also supported by the fact that the observed cutoff radii of all three satellites are equal to their tidal radii, assuming a low, globular cluster-like mass-to-light ratio. The large velocity dispersions of these galaxies, on the other hand, provide strong evidence for a massive dark matter component. In this case, the ``extratidal'' stars lie deeply embedded in the dark matter potential wells of the satellites. These stars then would represent a gravitationally bound, extended stellar component of unknown origin.},

The dichromat's color confusions are deduced from colorimetry, and the residual hues in the transformed image are derived from the reports of unilateral dichromats described in the literature. We represent color stimuli as vectors in a three-dimensional LMS space, and the simulation algorithm is expressed in terms of transformations of this space. The algorithm replaces each stimulus by its projection onto a reduced stimulus surface. This surface is defined by a neutral axis and by the LMS locations of those monochromatic stimuli that are perceived as the same hue by normal trichromats and a given type of dichromat. These monochromatic stimuli were a yellow of 575 nm and a blue of 475 nm for the protan and deutan simulations, and a red of 660 nm and a blue--green of 485 nm for the tritan simulation. The operation of the algorithm is demonstrated with a mosaic of square color patches. A protanope and a deuteranope accepted the match between the original and the appropriate image, confirming that the reduction is colorimetrically accurate. Although we can never be certain of another's sensations, the simulation provides a means of quantifying and illustrating the residual color information available to dichromats in any digitized image.},

The latter is further decomposed into the individual large accretion events that built up the Galactic stellar halo: the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Kraken and Sequoia structures, and the Sagittarius and Helmi streams. Our modelling is extensively tested using mock GC samples constructed from the AURIGA suite of hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies. We find that, on average, a proportion of the accreted GCs cannot be associated with their true infall group and are left ungrouped, biasing our recovered population numbers to \${\textbackslash}sim 80\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of their true value. Furthermore, the identified groups have a completeness and a purity of only \${\textbackslash}sim 65\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$. This reflects the difficulty of the problem, a result of the large degree of overlap in energy-action space of the debris from past accretion events. We apply the method to the Galactic data to infer, in a statistically robust and easily quantifiable way, the GCs associated with each MW accretion event. The resulting groups' population numbers of GCs, corrected for biases, are then used to infer the halo and stellar masses of the now defunct satellites that built up the halo of the MW.},

Using the measured line fluxes, we derive abundance ratios of individual elements within the interstellar medium (ISM) of this superluminous galaxy. Driven by the unusually-bright N III] {$\lambda$}1750 and N IV] {$\lambda$}1486 emission lines (and by comparison, faint O III] {$\lambda\lambda$}1660, 1666 lines), our fiducial model prefers log (N/O) {$>$} -0.25, greater than four times solar and in stark contrast to lower-redshift star-forming galaxies. The derived log (C/O) {$>$} -0.78, ({$\approx$}30 per cent solar) is also elevated with respect to galaxies of similar metallicity (12 + log (O/H) {$\approx$} 7.82), although less at odds with lower-redshift measurements. We explore the feasibility of achieving these abundance ratios via several enrichment mechanisms using metal yields available in the literature. Given the long time-scale typically expected to enrich nitrogen with stellar winds, traditional scenarios require a very fine-tuned formation history to reproduce such an elevated N/O. We find no compelling evidence that nitrogen enhancement in GN-z11 can be explained by enrichment from metal-free Population III stars. Interestingly, yields from runaway stellar collisions in a dense stellar cluster or a tidal disruption event provide promising solutions to give rise to these unusual emission lines at z = 10.6, and explain the resemblance between GN-z11 and a nitrogen-loud quasar. These recent observations showcase the new frontier opened by JWST to constrain galactic enrichment and stellar evolution within 440 Myr of the big bang.},

  abstract = {Interpreting and modelling astronomical catalogues requires an understanding of the catalogues' completeness or selection function: what properties determine an object's probability of being including in the catalogue? Here we set out to empirically quantify the completeness of the overall catalogue of Gaia's third data release (DR3). This task is not straightforward because Gaia is the all-sky optical survey with the highest angular resolution to date and no consistent ground truth exists to allow direct comparisons. However, well-characterised deeper imaging enables an empirical assessment of Gaia's G-band completeness across parts of the sky. On this basis, we devised a simple analytical completeness model of Gaia as a function of the observed G magnitude and position over the sky, which accounts for both the effects of crowding and the complex Gaia scanning law. Our model only depends on a single quantity: the median magnitude M10 in a patch of the sky of catalogued sources with astrometric\_matched\_transits {$\leq$}10. We note that M10 reflects elementary completeness decisions in the Gaia pipeline and is computable from the Gaia DR3 catalogue itself and therefore applicable across the whole sky. We calibrated our model using the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) and tested its predictions against Hubble Space Telescope observations of globular clusters. We found that our model predicts Gaia's completeness values to a few per cent (RMS) across the sky. We make the model available as a part of the gaiaunlimited Python package built and maintained by the GaiaUnlimited project.},

  abstract = {As is usual in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, today the Local Group galaxy Ursa Minor is depleted of its gas content. How this galaxy lost its gas is still a matter of debate. To study the history of gas loss in Ursa Minor, we conducted the first three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of this object, assuming that the gas loss was driven by galactic winds powered only by type II supernovae (SNe II). The initial gas setup and supernova (SN) rates used in our simulations are mainly constrained by the inferred star formation history and the observed velocity dispersion of Ursa Minor. After 3 Gyr of evolution, we found that the gas removal efficiency is higher when the SN rate is increased, and also when the initial mean gas density is lowered. The derived mass-loss rates are systematically higher in the central regions ( 300 pc), even though such a relationship has not been strictly linear in time and in terms of the galactic radius. The filamentary structures induced by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and the concentric shells related to the acoustic waves driven by SNe can account for the inferred mass losses from the simulations. Our results suggest that SNe II are able to transfer most of the gas from the central region outward to the galactic halo. However, other physical mechanisms must be considered in order to completely remove the gas at larger radii.},

Moreover, the ram-pressure wind was stalled and inverted by thermal pressure of the interstellar medium and supernovae feedback during the same interval.},

  abstract = {Stellar prolate rotation in dwarf galaxies is rather uncommon, with only two known galaxies in the Local Group showing such feature (Phoenix and And II). Cosmological simulations show that in massive early-type galaxies prolate rotation likely arises from major mergers. However, the origin of such kinematics in the dwarf galaxies regime has only been explored using idealized simulations. Here, we made use of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of dwarfs galaxies with stellar mass between 3 {\texttimes} 105 and 5 {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$} to explore the formation of prolate rotators. Out of 27 dwarfs, only one system showed clear rotation around the major axis, whose culprit is a major merger at \$z\$ = 1.64, which caused the transition from an oblate to a prolate configuration. Interestingly, this galaxy displays a steep metallicity gradient, reminiscent of the one measured in Phoenix and And II: this is the outcome of the merger event that dynamically heats old, metal-poor stars, and of the centrally concentrated residual star formation. Major mergers in dwarf galaxies offer a viable explanation for the formation of such peculiar systems, characterized by steep metallicity gradients and prolate rotation.},

By selecting 15 radial velocity confirmed members of Bo{\"o}tes III, along with a likely RR Lyrae member in the vicinity, we measure an error-weighted mean PM of ({$\mu$} {$\alpha$} {\textbackslash}cos {$\delta$} , {$\mu$} {$\delta$} ) = (-1.14, -0.98) {\textpm} (0.18, 0.20) mas yr-1. We select and present further stars that may be Bo{\"o}tes III members based on their combined PM and position in the color-magnitude diagram. We caution against assigning membership to stars that are not confirmed spectroscopically, as we demonstrate that there are contaminating stars from the disrupting globular cluster NGC 5466 in the vicinity of the main body of Bo{\"o}tes III, but we note that our results are consistent with previous Bo{\"o}tes III PM estimates that did not include spectroscopic members. Based on the measured PM and other known properties of Bo{\"o}tes III, we derive its Galactocentric velocity and compute its orbit given canonical MW potentials with halo masses of both 0.8 {\texttimes} 1012 M {$\odot$} and 1.6 {\texttimes} 1012 M {$\odot$}. These orbits robustly show that Bo{\"o}tes III passed within {$\sim$}12 kpc of the Galactic center on an eccentric orbit roughly {$\sim$}140 Myr ago. Additionally, the PM of Bo{\"o}tes III is in excellent agreement with predictions for the retrograde motion of the coincident Styx stellar stream. Given this, along with the small pericenter and metallicity spread of Bo{\"o}tes III itself, we suggest that it is a disrupting dwarf galaxy giving rise to the Styx stellar stream.},

  abstract = {Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or "tidal tracks", of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.},

  abstract = {Context. Understanding the intricacies behind the presence and absence of sources in an astronomical catalogue is crucial for the accurate interpretation of astronomical data. In particular, for the multi-dimensional Gaia data, filters and cuts on different parameters or measurements introduce a selection function that may unintentionally alter scientific conclusions in subtle ways. Aims: We aim to develop a methodology to estimate the selection function for different subsamples of stars in the Gaia catalogue. Methods: Comparing the number of stars in a given subsample to that in the overall Gaia catalogue provides an estimate of the subsample membership probability as a function of sky position, magnitude, and colour. The method used to make this estimate must differentiate the stochastic absence of subsample stars from selection effects. When multiplied with the overall Gaia catalogue selection function, this provides the total selection function of the subsample. Results: We present our new method for estimating the selection function by applying it to the sources in Gaia DR3 with heliocentric radial velocity measurements. We also compute the selection function for the stars in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus sample, confirming that the apparent asymmetry of its debris across the sky is merely caused by selection effects. Conclusions: The method we have developed estimates the selection function of the stars present in a subsample of Gaia data, given that the subsample is completely contained in the Gaia parent catalogue (for which the selection function is known). This tool is made available in a GaiaUnlimited Python package.},

  abstract = {The Milky Way (MW) offers a uniquely detailed view of galactic structure and is often regarded as a prototypical spiral galaxy. But recent observations indicate that the MW is atypical: it has an undersized supermassive black hole at its centre; it is surrounded by a very low mass, excessively metal-poor stellar halo; and it has an unusually large nearby satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Here, we show that the LMC is on a collision course with the MW with which it will merge in 2.4{\textasciicircum}\{+1.2\}\_\{-0.8\} \{Gyr\} (68 per cent confidence level). This catastrophic and long-overdue event will restore the MW to normality. Using the EAGLE galaxy formation simulation, we show that, as a result of the merger, the central supermassive black hole will increase in mass by up to a factor of 8. The Galactic stellar halo will undergo an equally impressive transformation, becoming 5 times more massive. The additional stars will come predominantly from the disrupted LMC, but a sizeable number will be ejected on to the halo from the stellar disc. The post-merger stellar halo will have the median metallicity of the LMC, [Fe/H] = -0.5 dex, which is typical of other galaxies of similar mass to the MW. At the end of this exceptional event, the MW will become a true benchmark for spiral galaxies, at least temporarily.},

  abstract = {Calculation of the mass transfer (MT) rate \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{d\}\$ of a Roche lobe overflowing star is a fundamental task in binary star evolution theory. Most of the existing MT prescriptions are based on a common set of assumptions that combine optically thick and optically thin regimes with different flow geometries. In this work, we develop a new model of MT based on the assumption that the Roche potential sets up a nozzle converging on the inner Lagrangian point and that the gas flows mostly along the axis connecting both stars. We derive a set of 1D hydrodynamic equations governing the gas flow with \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{d\}\$ determined as the eigenvalue of the system. The inner boundary condition directly relates our model to the structure of the donor obtained from 1D stellar evolution codes. We obtain an algebraic solution for the polytropic equation-of-state (EOS). This gives \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{d\}\$ within a factor of 0.9 to 1.0 of existing optically thick prescriptions and reduces to the existing optically thin prescription for isothermal gas. For a realistic EOS, we find that \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{d\}\$ differs by up to a factor of 4 from existing models. We illustrate the effects of our new MT model on a \$30{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ low-metallicity star undergoing intensive thermal time-scale MT and find that it is more likely to become unstable to L2 overflow and common-envelope evolution than expected according to MT prescriptions. Our model provides a framework to include additional physics such as radiation or magnetic fields.},

Leveraging deep Gemini/GMOS-N imaging (for four candidates) as well as follow-up DECam imaging (for two candidates), we characterize the morphologies and stellar populations of these systems. We find that these candidates all share faint absolute magnitudes (M V {$\geq$} -3.2 mag) and old, metal-poor stellar populations ({$\tau$} {$>$} 10 Gyr, [Fe/H] {$<$} -1.4 dex). Three of these systems are more extended (r 1/2 {$>$} 15 pc), while the other three are compact (r 1/2 {$<$} 10 pc). From these properties, we infer that the former three systems (Bo{\"o}tes V, Leo Minor I, and Virgo II) are consistent with ultra-faint dwarf galaxy classifications, whereas the latter three (DELVE 3, DELVE 4, and DELVE 5) are likely ultra-faint star clusters. Using data from the Gaia satellite, we confidently measure the proper motion of Bo{\"o}tes V, Leo Minor I, and DELVE 4, and tentatively detect a proper-motion signal from DELVE 3 and DELVE 5; no signal is detected for Virgo II. We use these measurements to explore possible associations between the newly discovered systems and the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, the Magellanic Clouds, and the Vast Polar Structure, finding several plausible associations.

  abstract = {The stellar populations of galaxies hold vital clues to their formation histories. In this paper we present results based on modeling stacked spectra of early-type galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a function of velocity dispersion, {$\sigma$}, from 90 km s-1 to 300 km s-1. The spectra are of extremely high quality, with typical signal-to-noise ratio of 1000 {\AA}-1, and a wavelength coverage of 4000 {\AA} -8800 {\AA}. Our population synthesis model includes variation in 16 elements from C to Ba, a two-component star formation history, the shift in effective temperature, {$\Delta$} T eff, of the stars with respect to a solar metallicity isochrone, and the stellar initial mass function, among other parameters. In our approach we fit the full optical spectra rather than a select number of spectral indices and are able to, for the first time, measure the abundances of the elements V, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni from the integrated light of distant galaxies. Our main results are as follows: (1) light-weighted stellar ages range from 6-12 Gyr from low to high {$\sigma$} (2) [Fe/H] varies by less than 0.1 dex across the entire sample; (3) Mg closely tracks O, and both increase from {$\approx$}0.0 at low {$\sigma$} to {\textasciitilde}0.25 at high {$\sigma$} Si and Ti show a shallower rise with {$\sigma$}, and Ca tracks Fe rather than O; (4) the iron peak elements V, Cr, Mn, and Ni track Fe, while Co tracks O, suggesting that Co forms primarily in massive stars; (5) C and N track O over the full sample and [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] exceed 0.2 at high {$\sigma$} and (6) the variation in {$\Delta$} T eff with total metallicity closely follows theoretical predictions based on stellar evolution theory. This last result is significant because it implies that we are robustly solving not only for the detailed abundance patterns but also the detailed temperature distributions (i.e., isochrones) of the stars in these galaxies. A variety of tests reveal that the systematic uncertainties in our measurements are probably 0.05 dex or less. Our derived [Mg/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundance ratios are 0.05-0.1 dex lower than most previous determinations. Under the conventional interpretation that the variation in these ratios is due to star formation timescale variations, our results suggest longer star formation timescales for massive early-type galaxies than previous studies. Detailed chemical evolution models are necessary in order to translate the abundance ratio distributions of these galaxies into constraints on their formation histories. Alternatively, these data may provide useful constraints on the nucleosynthetic pathways for elements whose production is not well understood.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{$>$}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\textasciitilde}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma$}{\textasciitilde}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\textasciitilde}0.2 Msolar and {$\sigma$}{\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\textasciitilde}n*{\textasciitilde}0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {$>$}{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

  abstract = {Subhaloes are critical in distinguishing dark matter models, yet their evolution within galactic haloes, particularly in the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) model, remains challenging to fully investigate in numerical simulations. In this work, we employ the fluid-wave hybrid scheme recently implemented in the GAMER-2 code to perform a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-sized halo with an FDM particle mass of m = 2 x 10{\textasciicircum}(-23) eV. It simultaneously resolves the solitonic core of the host halo and tracks the complex tidal evolution of subhaloes down to redshift z = 0. We examine the internal structure of subhaloes by analyzing their density profiles, velocity dispersions, and density power spectra across various redshifts. Our findings show that partially tidally stripped subhaloes deviate from the core-halo mass relation; their solitons remain intact and are enveloped by smaller granules predominantly from the host halo. Furthermore, our simulation unravels a complex tidal evolution of FDM subhaloes. On the one hand, we observe a subhalo core undergoing complete tidal disruption at z {\textasciitilde} 0.14, which later reemerges near the outskirts of the host halo around z {\textasciitilde} 0. This disruption event, characterized by a core contaminated with interference fringes from the host halo's wave function, occurs earlier than previously predicted. On the other hand, FDM subhaloes have denser cores before infall due to the presence of central solitons, making them more resilient to tidal disruption than their N-body counterparts. Our results demonstrate GAMER-2's capability to resolve non-linear FDM substructure down to z = 0, paving the way for future studies of larger FDM subhalo samples with heavier particle masses. The simulation code GAMER-2 and the simulation setup used in this work are available at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer.},

  abstract = {Many population synthesis and stellar evolution studies have addressed the evolution of close binary systems in which the primary is a compact remnant and the secondary is filling its Roche lobe, thus triggering mass transfer. Although tidal locking is expected in such systems, most studies have neglected the rotationally induced mixing that may occur. Here we study the possible effects of mixing in mass-losing stars for a range of secondary star masses and metallicities. We find that tidal locking can induce rotational mixing prior to contact and thus affect the evolution of the secondary star if the effects of the Spruit-Tayler dynamo are included both for angular momentum and chemical transport. Once contact is made, the effect of mass transfer tends to be more rapid than the evolutionary timescale, so the effects of mixing are no longer directly important, but the mass-transfer strips matter to inner layers that may have been affected by the mixing. These effects are enhanced for secondaries of 1-1.2 M {$\odot$} and for lower metallicities. We discuss the possible implications for the paucity of carbon in the secondaries of the cataclysmic variable SS Cyg and the black hole candidate XTE J1118+480 and for the progenitor evolution of Type Ia supernovae. We also address the issue of the origin of blue straggler stars in globular and open clusters. We find that for models that include rotation consistent with that observed for some blue straggler stars, evolution is chemically homogeneous. This leads to tracks in the H-R diagram that are brighter and bluer than the non-rotating main-sequence turn-off point. Rotational mixing could thus be one of the factors that contribute to the formation of blue stragglers.},

We extend their ideas of using the debiased estimator and further propose a bootstrap approach for constructing simultaneous confidence bands. This modified method has an advantage that we can easily choose the smoothing bandwidth from conventional bandwidth selectors and the confidence band will be asymptotically valid. We prove the validity of the bootstrap confidence band and generalize it to density level sets and inverse regression problems. Simulation studies confirm the validity of the proposed confidence bands/sets. We apply our approach to an Astronomy dataset to show its applicability.},

  abstract = {It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised \$N\$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.},

We find that every star is deficient in metals (-3.6 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} -1.9) and in neutron-capture elements as is characteristic of UFD stars, unambiguously confirming their association with Tucana II. Other chemical abundances (e.g., C, iron peak) largely follow UFD trends and suggest that faint core-collapse supernovae (SNe) dominated the early evolution of Tucana II. We see a downturn in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] at [Fe/H] {$\approx$} -2.8, indicating the onset of Type Ia SN enrichment and somewhat extended chemical evolution. The most metal-rich star has strikingly low [Sc/Fe] = -1.29 {\textpm} 0.48 and [Mn/Fe] = -1.33 {\textpm} 0.33, implying significant enrichment by a sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia SN. We do not detect a radial velocity gradient in Tucana II ( \$\{\{dv\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{helio\}\}/d\{{\textbackslash}theta \}\_\{1\}=-\{2.6\}\_\{-2.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.0\}\$ km s-1 kpc-1), reflecting a lack of evidence for tidal disruption, and derive a dynamical mass of \$\{M\}\_\{1/2\}{\textbackslash},(\{r\}\_\{h\})=\{1.6\}\_\{-0.7\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\$ M {$\odot$}. We revisit formation scenarios of the extended component of Tucana II in light of its stellar chemical abundances. We find no evidence that Tucana II had abnormally energetic SNe, suggesting that if SNe drove in situ stellar halo formation, then other UFDs should show similar such features. Although not a unique explanation, the decline in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] is consistent with an early galactic merger triggering later star formation. Future observations may disentangle such formation channels of UFD outskirts. * This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

Here we present the detection of temperature-sensitive oxygen emission lines from three galaxies at 2 {$\lessequivlnt$} z {$\lessequivlnt$} 3.5, which enables us to directly determine the oxygen abundances and thereby double the number of galaxies at z {$>$} 2 for which this has been possible. The three galaxies have {$\sim$}10 per cent solar oxygen abundances in agreement with strong emission-line diagnostics. Carbon and nitrogen ratios relative to oxygen are subsolar as expected for young metal-poor galaxies. Two of the galaxies are Lyman {$\alpha$} (Ly{$\alpha$}) emitters with rest-frame equivalent widths of 20 and 40 {\AA}, respectively, and their high magnification factors allow us for the first time to gain insight into the physical characteristics of high-redshift Ly{$\alpha$} emitters. Using constraints from the physical properties of the galaxies, we accurately reproduce their line profiles with radiative transfer models. The models show a relatively small outflow in agreement with the observed small velocity offsets between nebular emission and interstellar absorption lines.

  abstract = {We are entering an era in which we will be able to detect and characterize hundreds of dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume. It is already known that a strong dichotomy exists in the gas content and star formation properties of field dwarf galaxies versus satellite dwarfs of larger galaxies. In this work, we study the more subtle differences that may be detectable in galaxies as a function of distance from a massive galaxy, such as the Milky Way. We compare smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of dwarf galaxies formed in a Local Volume-like environment (several megaparsecs away from a massive galaxy) to those formed nearer to Milky Way--mass halos. We find that the impact of environment on dwarf galaxies extends even beyond the immediate region surrounding Milky Way--mass halos. Even before being accreted as satellites, dwarf galaxies near a Milky Way--mass halo tend to have higher stellar masses for their halo mass than more isolated galaxies. Dwarf galaxies in high-density environments also tend to grow faster and form their stars earlier. We show observational predictions that demonstrate how these trends manifest in lower quenching rates, higher H I fractions, and bluer colors for more isolated dwarf galaxies.},

We aim to use this dataset to study the structural properties of Sextans overall stellar population and its member stars in different evolutionary phases, as well as to search for possible signs of tidal disturbance from the Milky Way, which would indicate departure from dynamical equilibrium. Methods: We performed the most accurate and quantitative structural analysis to-date of Sextans' stellar components by applying Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain methods to the individual stars' positions. Surface density maps are built by statistically decontaminating the sample through a matched filter analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram, and then analysed for departures from axisymmetry. Results: Sextans is found to be significantly less spatially extended and more centrally concentrated than early studies suggested. No statistically significant distortions or signs of tidal disturbances were found down to a surface brightness limit of {\textasciitilde}31.8 mag/arcsec2 in V-band. We identify an overdensity in the central regions that may correspond to previously reported kinematic substructure(s). In agreement with previous findings, old and metal-poor stars such as Blue Horizontal Branch stars cover a much larger area than stars in other evolutionary phases, and bright Blue Stragglers (BSs) are less spatially extended than faint ones. However, the different spatial distribution of bright and faint BSs appears consistent with the general age and metallicity gradients found in Sextans' stellar component. This is compatible with Sextans BSs having formed by evolution of binaries and not necessarily due to the presence of a central disrupted globular cluster, as suggested in the literature. We provide structural parameters for the various populations analysed and make publicly available the photometric catalogue of point-sources as well as a catalogue of literature spectroscopic measurements with updated membership probabilities.

We find the spatial distribution of stars to vary as a function of the colour/metallicity, being rather regular and round for the blue (metal-poor) red giant branch and main-sequence turn-off stars but much more elliptical and irregularly shaped for the red (metal-rich) ones, with a distinct `shell-like' overdensity in the northeast side. We also detect kinematic anomalies, in the form of a `ring-like' feature with a considerably larger systemic line-of-sight velocity and lower metallicity than the rest of stars; even the photometrically selected component with a regular looking spatial distribution displays complex kinematics. With a stellar mass of just \{{$\sim$} \}5{\texttimes} 105 M\_\{{$\odot$}\}, Sextans becomes the smallest galaxy presenting clear observational signs of accretion to date.},

This leads to questions about whether such deviations are physical or numerical; code validation studies are important and necessary tools for studying these questions. We provide the first direct comparison between the Monash stellar evolution program and MESA for a 2M {$\odot$} model evolved from the zero-age main sequence to the tip of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch. We compare the internal structure of the two models at six critical evolutionary points and find that they are in excellent agreement with regard to characteristics like central temperature, central density, and the temperature at the base of the convective envelope during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch. The H-exhausted core mass between the models differs by less than 4.2\% throughout the entire evolution; the final values vary only by 1.5\%. Surface quantities such as luminosity and radius vary by less than 0.2\% prior to the asymptotic giant branch. During thermal pulses, the difference extends to 3.4\%, largely due to uncertainties in mixing and the treatment of atmospheric boundary conditions. Given that the veteran Monash code is closed-source, the present work provides the first fully open-source computational analog. This increases accessibility to precision modeling on the asymptotic giant branch and lays the groundwork for higher-mass calculations that are performed with MESA but preserve the standards of the Monash code during the asymptotic giant branch.},

  abstract = {The disc structure of the Milky Way is marked by a chemical dichotomy, with high-{$\alpha$} and low-{$\alpha$} abundance sequences, traditionally identified with the geometric thick and thin discs. This identification is aided by the old ages of the high-{$\alpha$} stars, and lower average ages of the low-{$\alpha$} ones. Recent large-scale surveys such as APOGEE have provided a wealth of data on this chemical structure, including showing that an identification of chemical and geometric thick discs is not exact, but the origin of the chemical dichotomy has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that a dichotomy arises naturally if the early gas-rich disc fragments, leading to some fraction of the star formation occuring in clumps of the type observed in high-redshift galaxies. These clumps have high star formation rate density. They therefore enrich rapidly, moving from the low-{$\alpha$} to the high-{$\alpha$} sequence, while more distributed star formation produces the low-{$\alpha$} sequence. We demonstrate that this model produces a chemically defined thick disc that has many of the properties of the Milky Way's thick disc. Because clump formation is common in high-redshift galaxies, we predict that chemical bimodalities are common in massive galaxies.},

However, accurately characterizing the dark matter content of dwarf galaxies is challenging due to limited data and complex dynamics that are difficult to accurately model. In this paper, we apply spherical Jeans modelling to simulated stellar kinematic data of spherical, isotropic dwarf galaxies with the goal of identifying the future observational directions that can improve the accuracy of the inferred dark matter distributions in the Milky Way dwarf galaxies. We explore how the dark matter inference is affected by the location and number of observed stars as well as the line-of-sight velocity measurement errors. We use mock observation to demonstrate the difficulty in constraining the inner core/cusp of the dark matter distribution with data sets of fewer than 10 000 stars. We also demonstrate the need for additional measurements to make robust estimates of the expected dark matter annihilation signal strength. For the purpose of deriving robust indirect detection constraints, we identify Ursa Major II, Ursa Minor, and Draco as the systems that would most benefit from additional stars being observed.},

  abstract = {We describe the GALFORM semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology  and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30 per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique. Our more detailed methods do not change our earlier conclusion that just over half the stars in the Universe are expected to have formed since},

  abstract = {The results of a wide-field survey of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy are presented. Our aims were to obtain an accurate map of the outer structure of Sculptor and to determine the level of interaction between this system and the Galaxy. Photometry was obtained in two colors down to the magnitude limits of V=20 and I=19, covering a 3.1d{\texttimes}3.1d area centered on Sculptor. The resulting color-magnitude data were used as a mask to select candidate horizontal-branch (HB) and red giant branch stars for this system. Previous work has shown that the red HB stars are more concentrated than the blue HB stars. We have determined the radial distributions of these two populations and show that the overall Sculptor density profile is well described by a two-component model based on a combination of these radial distributions. In addition, spectra of the Ca II triplet region were obtained for over 700 candidate red giant stars over the 10 deg2 region using the 2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These spectra were used to remove foreground Galactic stars based on radial velocity and Ca II triplet strength. The final list of Sculptor members contains 148 stars, 7 of which are located beyond the nominal tidal radius. Both the photometric and spectroscopic data sets indicate no significant extratidal structure. These results support at most a mild level of interaction between this system and the Galaxy, and we have measured an upper mass limit for extratidal material to be 2.3\%+/-0.6\% of the Sculptor luminous mass. This lack of tidal interaction indicates that previous velocity dispersion measurements (and hence the amount of dark matter detected) in this system are not strongly influenced by the Galactic tidal field.},

The number of stars in the in-situ population rapidly increases above [Fe/H]=-1. The average kinematics of these stars are hot and independent of metallicity at [Fe/H]{$<$}-1 and then become increasingly cold and disk-like at higher metallicities. The ages of the in-situ, high-alpha stars are uniformly very old (13 Gyr) at [Fe/H]{$<$}-1.3, and span a wider range (8-12 Gyr) at higher metallicities. Interpreting the chemistry with a simple chemical evolution model suggests that the non-monotonic behavior is due to a significant increase in star formation efficiency, which began 13 Gyr ago. These results support a picture in which the first 1 Gyr of the Galaxy was characterized by a "simmering phase" in which the star formation efficiency was low and the kinematics had substantial disorder with some net rotation. The disk then underwent a dramatic transformation to a "boiling phase", in which the star formation efficiency increased substantially, the kinematics became disk-like, and the number of stars formed increased tenfold. We interpret this transformation as the birth of the Galactic disk at z{\textasciitilde}4. The physical origin of this transformation is unclear and does not seem to be reproduced in current galaxy formation models.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, several ultra faint objects (UFOs, MV {$\greaterequivlnt$} -3.5) have been discovered in the outer halo of the Milky Way. For some of these objects, it is not clear whether they are star clusters or (ultra faint) dwarf galaxies. In this work, we quantify the contribution of star clusters to the population of UFOs. We extrapolated the mass and Galactocentric radius distribution of the globular clusters using a population model, finding that the Milky Way contains about 3.3{\textasciicircum}\{+7.3\}\_\{-1.6\} star clusters with MV {$\greaterequivlnt$} -3.5 and Galactocentric radius {$\geq$}20 kpc. To understand whether dissolving clusters can appear as UFOs, we run a suite of direct N-body models, varying the orbit, the Galactic potential, the binary fraction and the black hole (BH) natal kick velocities. In the analyses, we consider observational biases such as luminosity limit, field stars and line-of-sight projection. We find that star clusters contribute to both the compact and the extended population of UFOs: clusters without BHs appear compact with radii {$\sim$}5 pc, while clusters that retain their BHs after formation have radii {$\greaterequivlnt$} 20 pc. The properties of the extended clusters are remarkably similar to those of dwarf galaxies: high-inferred mass-to-light ratios due to binaries, binary properties mildly affected by dynamical evolution, no observable mass segregation and flattened stellar mass function. We conclude that the slope of the stellar mass function as a function of Galactocentric radius and the presence/absence of cold streams can discriminate between dark matter-free and dark matter-dominated UFOs.},

Our survey comprises 22 systems with iron abundance less than 1/100 solar; observations of seven of these are reported here for the first time. Together with recent measures of the abundances of C and O in Galactic metal-poor stars, we reinvestigate the trend of C/O in the very metal-poor (VMP) regime and we compare, for the first time, the O/Fe ratios in the most metal-poor DLAs and in halo stars. We confirm the near-solar values of C/O in DLAs at the lowest metallicities probed, and find that their distribution is in agreement with that seen in Galactic halo stars. We find that the O/Fe ratio in VMP DLAs is essentially constant, and shows very little dispersion, with a mean []=+0.39 {\textpm} 0.12, in good agreement with the values measured in Galactic halo stars when the oxygen abundance is measured from the [O I] {$\lambda$}6300 line. We speculate that such good agreement in the observed abundance trends points to a universal origin for these metals. In view of this agreement, we construct the abundance pattern for a typical VMP DLA and compare it to model calculations of Population II and Population III nucleosynthesis to determine the origin of the metals in VMP DLAs. Our results suggest that the most metal-poor DLAs may have been enriched by a generation of metal-free stars; however, given that abundance measurements are currently available for only a few elements, we cannot yet rule out an additional contribution from Population II stars.

On the basis of 13 resolved D I absorption lines and the damping wings of the H I Ly{$\alpha$} transition, we have obtained a new, precise measure of the primordial abundance of deuterium. Furthermore, to bolster the present statistics of precision D/H measures, we have reanalyzed all of the known deuterium absorption-line systems that satisfy a set of strict criteria. We have adopted a blind analysis strategy (to remove human bias) and developed a software package that is specifically designed for precision D/H abundance measurements. For this reanalyzed sample of systems, we obtain a weighted mean of (D/H)p = (2.53 {\textpm} 0.04) {\texttimes} 10-5, corresponding to a universal baryon density 100 {\textohm}b, 0 h 2 = 2.202 {\textpm} 0.046 for the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). By combining our measure of (D/H)p with observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we derive the effective number of light fermion species, N eff = 3.28 {\textpm} 0.28. We therefore rule out the existence of an additional (sterile) neutrino (i.e., N eff = 4.046) at 99.3\% confidence (2.7{$\sigma$}), provided that the values of N eff and of the baryon-to-photon ratio ({$\eta$}10) did not change between BBN and recombination. We also place a strong bound on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, independent of the 4He primordial mass fraction, Y P: {$\xi$}D = +0.05 {\textpm} 0.13 based only on the CMB+(D/H)p observations. Combining this value of {$\xi$}D with the current best literature measure of Y P, we find a 2{$\sigma$} upper bound on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, {\textbar}{$\xi\vert$} {$<$}= +0.062.

  abstract = {We present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. Our model is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in these simulations with stellar populations predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical evolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity function (LF) and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well with observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that accreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 7 from less than five significant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with stellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals (107-108 Msolar). In contrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these major contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the number of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently stochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which amplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo hosts. The masses ({\textasciitilde} 108-109 Msolar) and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes (from 10 to 100 kpc) are consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a complex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells and other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth models. The central regions ({$<$}10 kpc) of our haloes are highly prolate (c/a {\textasciitilde} 0.3), although we find one example of a massive accreted thick disc. Metallicity gradients in our haloes are typically significant only where the halo is built from a small number of satellites. We contrast the ages and metallicities of halo stars with surviving satellites, finding broad agreement with recent observations.},

  abstract = {The ongoing interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and its largest satellite - the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) - creates a significant perturbation in the distribution and kinematics of distant halo stars, globular clusters and satellite galaxies, and leads to biases in MW mass estimates from these tracer populations. We present a method for compensating these perturbations for any choice of MW potential by computing the past trajectory of LMC and MW and then integrating the orbits of tracer objects back in time until the influence of the LMC is negligible, at which point the equilibrium approximation can be used with any standard dynamical modelling approach. We add this orbit-rewinding step to the mass estimation approach based on simultaneous fitting of the potential and the distribution function of tracers, and apply it to two data sets with the latest Gaia EDR3 measurements of 6D phase-space coordinates: globular clusters and satellite galaxies. We find that models with LMC mass in the range \$(1{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!2) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ better fit the observed distribution of tracers, and measure MW mass within 100 kpc to be \$(0.75{\textbackslash}pm 0.1){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, while neglecting the LMC perturbation increases it by {\textasciitilde}15 per cent.},

  abstract = {We use the OMEGA galactic chemical evolution code to investigate how the assumptions used for the treatment of galactic inflows and outflows impact numerical predictions. The goal is to determine how our capacity to reproduce the chemical evolution trends of a galaxy is affected by the choice of implementation used to include those physical processes. In pursuit of this goal, we experiment with three different prescriptions for galactic inflows and outflows and use OMEGA within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to recover the set of input parameters that best reproduces the chemical evolution of nine elements in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. This provides a consistent framework for comparing the best-fit solutions generated by our different models. Despite their different degrees of intended physical realism, we found that all three prescriptions can reproduce in an almost identical way the stellar abundance trends observed in Sculptor. This result supports the similar conclusions originally claimed by Romano \& Starkenburg for Sculptor. While the three models have the same capacity to fit the data, the best values recovered for the parameters controlling the number of SNe Ia and the strength of galactic outflows, are substantially different and in fact mutually exclusive from one model to another. For the purpose of understanding how a galaxy evolves, we conclude that only reproducing the evolution of a limited number of elements is insufficient and can lead to misleading conclusions. More elements or additional constraints such as the Galaxy's star-formation efficiency and the gas fraction are needed in order to break the degeneracy between the different modeling assumptions. Our results show that the successes and failures of chemical evolution models are predominantly driven by the input stellar yields, rather than by the complexity of the Galaxy model itself. Simple models such as OMEGA are therefore sufficient to test and validate stellar yields. OMEGA is part of the NuGrid chemical evolution package and is publicly available online at http://nugrid.github.io/NuPyCEE.},

This absorption system, which has an oxygen abundance [O/H] = -2.769 {\textpm} 0.028 ({$\simeq$}1/600 of the solar abundance), is among the lowest metallicity systems currently known where a precise measurement of the deuterium abundance is afforded. Our detailed analysis of this system concludes, on the basis of eight D I absorption lines, that the deuterium abundance of this gas cloud is \{log\}\vphantom\{\}10(\{\{D\}\}/\{\{H\}\})=-4.622+/- 0.015, which is in very good agreement with the results previously reported by Kirkman et al., but with an improvement on the precision of this single measurement by a factor of {$\sim$}3.5. Combining this new estimate with our previous sample of six high precision and homogeneously analyzed D/H measurements, we deduce that the primordial deuterium abundance is \{log\}\vphantom\{\}10\{(\{\{D\}\}/\{\{H\}\})\}\{\{P\}\}=-4.5974+/- 0.0052 or, expressed as a linear quantity, \{10\}5\{(\{\{D\}\}/\{\{H\}\})\}\{\{P\}\}=2.527+/- 0.030; this value corresponds to a one percent determination of the primordial deuterium abundance. Combining our result with a big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculation that uses the latest nuclear physics input, we find that the baryon density derived from BBN agrees to within 2{$\sigma$} of the latest results from the Planck cosmic microwave background data.

  abstract = {Context. R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables and their non-variable counterparts, the dustless Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars have been known to exhibit enhanced s-processed material on their surfaces, especially Sr, Y, and Ba. No comprehensive work has been done to explore the s-process in these types of stars, however one particular RCB star, U Aqr, has been under scrutiny for its extraordinary Sr enhancement. Aims: We aim to identify RCB and dLHdC stars that have significantly enhanced Sr abundances, such as U Aqr, and use stellar evolution models to begin to estimate the type of neutron exposure that occurs in a typical HdC star. Methods: We compared the strength of the Sr II 4077 {\AA} spectral line to Ca II H to identify the new subclass of Sr-rich HdCs. We additionally used the structural and abundance information from existing RCB MESA models to calculate the neutron exposure parameter, {$\tau$}. Results: We identified six stars in the Sr-rich class. Two are RCBs, and four are dLHdCs. We additionally found that the preferred RCB MESA model has a neutron exposure {$\tau$} {$\simeq$} 0.1 mb-1, which is lower than the estimated {$\tau$} between 0.15 and 0.6 mb-1 for the Sr-rich star U Aqr found in the literature. We found trends in the neutron exposure corresponding to He-burning shell temperature, metallicity, and assumed s-processing site. Conclusions: We have found a sub-class of six HdCs known as the Sr-rich class, which tend to lie in the halo, outside the typical distribution of RCBs and dLHdCs. We found that dLHdC stars are more likely to be Sr-rich than RCBs, with an occurrence rate of {\textasciitilde}13\% for dLHdCs and {\textasciitilde}2\% for RCBs. This is one of the first potential spectroscopic differences between RCBs and dLHdCs, along with dLHdCs having stronger surface abundances of 18O. We additionally found neutron exposure trends in our RCB models that will aide in understanding the interplay between model parameters and surface s-process elements.

  abstract = {The envelope of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars undergoing periodic third dredge-up (TDU) episodes is enriched in both light and heavy elements, the ashes of a complex internal nucleosynthesis involving p, {$\alpha$}, and n captures over hundreds of stable and unstable isotopes. In this paper, new models of low-mass AGB stars (2 M sun), with metallicity ranging between Z = 0.0138 (the solar one) and Z = 0.0001, are presented. Main features are (1) a full nuclear network (from H to Bi) coupled to the stellar evolution code, (2) a mass loss-period-luminosity relation, based on available data for long-period variables, and (3) molecular and atomic opacities for C- and/or N-enhanced mixtures, appropriate for the chemical modifications of the envelope caused by the TDU. For each model, a detailed description of the physical and chemical evolutions is presented; moreover, we present a uniform set of yields, comprehensive of all chemical species (from hydrogen to bismuth). The main nucleosynthesis site is the thin 13C pocket, which forms in the core-envelope transition region after each TDU episode. The formation of this 13C pocket is the principal by-product of the introduction of a new algorithm, which shapes the velocity profile of convective elements at the inner border of the convective envelope: both the physical grounds and the calibration of the algorithm are discussed in detail. We find that the pockets shrink (in mass) as the star climbs the AGB, so that the first pockets, the largest ones, leave the major imprint on the overall nucleosynthesis. Neutrons are released by the 13C({$\alpha$}, n)16O reaction during the interpulse phase in radiative conditions, when temperatures within the pockets attain T {\textasciitilde} 1.0 {\texttimes} 108 K, with typical densities of (106-107) neutrons cm-3. Exceptions are found, as in the case of the first pocket of the metal-rich models (Z = 0.0138, Z = 0.006 and Z = 0.003), where the 13C is only partially burned during the interpulse: the surviving part is ingested in the convective zone generated by the subsequent thermal pulse (TP) and then burned at T {\textasciitilde} 1.5 {\texttimes} 108 K, thus producing larger neutron densities (up to 1011 neutrons cm-3). An additional neutron exposure, caused by the 22Ne({$\alpha$}, n)25Mg during the TPs, is marginally activated at large Z, but becomes an important nucleosynthesis source at low Z, when most of the 22Ne is primary. The final surface compositions of the various models reflect the differences in the initial iron-seed content and in the physical structure of AGB stars belonging to different stellar populations. Thus, at large metallicities the nucleosynthesis of light s-elements (Sr, Y, Zr) is favored, whilst, decreasing the iron content, the overproduction of heavy s-elements (Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm) and lead becomes progressively more important. At low metallicities (Z = 0.0001) the main product is lead. The agreement with the observed [hs/ls] index observed in intrinsic C stars at different [Fe/H] is generally good. For the solar metallicity model, we found an interesting overproduction of some radioactive isotopes, like 60Fe, as a consequence of the anomalous first 13C pocket. Finally, light elements (C, F, Ne, and Na) are enhanced at any metallicity.},

Two stars, Chi1 Ori A and Gamma Cep, show large velocity variations probably due to stellar companions. In contrast, the remaining 14 stars are virtually constant in velocity, showing no changes larger than about 50 m/s. No obvious variations due to effects other than center-of-mass motion, including changes correlated with chromospheric activity, are observed. Seven stars show small, but statistically significant, long-term trends in the relative velocities. These cannot be due to about 10-80 Jupiter mass brown dwarfs in orbits with P less than about 50 yr, since these would have been previously detected by conventional astrometry; companions of about 1-9 Jupiter masses are inferred. Since relatively massive brown dwarfs are rare or nonexistent, at least as companions to normal stars, these low-mass objects could represent the tip of the planetary mass spectrum. Observations are continuing to confirm these variations, and to determine periods.},

However, SIMBA also yields an insufficiently sharp truncation of the z = 0 mass function, and too-large sizes for low-mass quenched galaxies.

We investigate the frequency of major mergers between dwarf galaxies in the Local Group using the ELVIS suite of cosmological zoom-in dissipationless simulations of Milky Way- and M31-like host halos. We find that {\textasciitilde}10\% of satellite dwarf galaxies with M star {$>$} 106 M {$\odot$} that are within the host virial radius experienced a major merger of stellar mass ratio closer than 0.1 since z = 1, with a lower fraction for lower mass dwarf galaxies. Recent merger remnants are biased toward larger radial distance and more recent virial infall times, because most recent mergers occurred shortly before crossing within the virial radius of the host halo. Satellite-satellite mergers also occur within the host halo after virial infall, catalyzed by the large fraction of dwarf galaxies that fell in as part of a group. The merger fraction doubles for dwarf galaxies outside of the host virial radius, so the most distant dwarf galaxies in the Local Group are the most likely to have experienced a recent major merger. We discuss the implications of these results on observable dwarf merger remnants, their star formation histories, the gas content of mergers, and massive black holes in dwarf galaxies.},

Our input galaxy models describe the stellar mass-halo mass relation, and the galaxy occupation fraction. The number of major and minor mergers depends on the type of dark matter; in particular, minor mergers are greatly suppressed in warm dark matter models. In addition, the number of mergers that bring in stars is strongly dependent on the galaxy occupation model. For example, minor mergers are negligible for stellar halo growth in models with a high mass threshold for galaxy formation (i.e. \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9.3\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at z = 0). Moreover, this threshold for galaxy formation can also determine the relative difference (if any) between the stellar haloes of satellite and field dwarfs. Using isolated simulations of dwarf-dwarf mergers, we show that the relative frequency of major and minor mergers predict very different stellar haloes: Typically, 'intermediate' dark matter merger ratios ({\textasciitilde}1:5) maximize the growth of distant stellar haloes. We discuss the observability of dwarf stellar haloes and find that the surface brightness of these features are incredibly faint. However, when several dwarfs are stacked together, models that form particularly rich stellar haloes could be detectable. Finally, we show that stellar streams in the Galactic halo overlapping in phase space with known dwarf satellites are likely remnants of their stripped stellar haloes. The mere existence of dwarf stellar haloes can already put constraints on some small-scale models, and thus observational probes should be a high priority.},

  abstract = {We study in simple terms the role of feedback in establishing the scaling relations of low-surface-brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies with stellar masses in the range 6 {\texttimes} 105{$\leq$}M*{$\leq$} 3 {\texttimes} 1010 M{$\odot$}. These galaxies -- as measured, for example, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and in the Local Group -- show tight correlations of internal velocity, metallicity and surface brightness (or radius) with M*. They define a fundamental line which distinguishes them from the brighter galaxies of high surface brightness and metallicity. The idealized model assumes spherical collapse of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes to virial equilibrium and angular momentum conservation. The relations for bright galaxies are reproduced by assuming that M* is a constant fraction of the halo mass M. The upper bound to the low-luminosity LSBs coincides with the virial velocity of haloes in which supernova feedback could significantly suppress star formation, V \&lt; 100 km s-1. We argue that the energy fed to the gas obeys ESN{$\propto$}M* despite the radiative losses, and equate it with the binding energy of the gas to obtain M*/M{$\propto$}V2. This idealized model provides surprisingly good fits to the scaling relations of low-luminosity LSBs and dwarfs, which indicates that supernova feedback had a primary role in determining the fundamental line. The apparent lower bound for galaxies at V{$\sim$} 10 km s-1 may be caused by the cooling barrier at T{$\sim$} 104 K. Some fraction of the dark haloes may show no stars as a result of complete gas removal, either by supernova winds from neighbouring galaxies or by radiative feedback after cosmological reionization at zion. Radiative feedback may also explain the distinction between dwarf spheroidals (dE) and irregulars (dI), where the dEs, typically of V{$\leq$} 30 km s-1, form stars before zion and are then cleaned out of gas, whereas the dIs, with V \&gt; 30 km s-1, retain gas-rich discs with feedback-regulated star formation.},

  abstract = {Context. To understand the formation and composition of planetary systems, it is essential to have insights into the chemical composition of their host stars. In particular, C/O elemental ratios are useful for constraining the density and bulk composition of terrestrial planets. Aims: We study the carbon abundances with a twofold objective. On the one hand, we want to evaluate the behaviour of carbon in the context of Galactic chemical evolution. On the other hand, we focus on the possible dependence of carbon abundances on the presence of planets and on the impact of various factors (such as different oxygen lines) on the determination of C/O elemental ratios. Methods: We derived chemical abundances of carbon from two atomic lines for 757 FGK stars in the HARPS-GTO sample, observed with high-resolution (R {\textasciitilde} 115 000) and high-quality spectra. The abundances were derived using a standard Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis with automatically measured Equivalent Widths injected into the code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres. Oxygen abundances, derived using different lines, were taken from previous papers in this series and updated with the new stellar parameters. Results: We find that thick- and thin-disk stars are chemically disjunct for [C/Fe] across the full metallicity range that they have in common. Moreover, the population of high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich stars also presents higher and clearly separated [C/Fe] ratios than thin-disk stars up to [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} 0.2 dex. The [C/O] ratios present a general flat trend as a function of [O/H] but becomes negative at [O/H] {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0dex. This trend is more clear when considering stars of similar metallicity. We find tentative evidence that stars with low-mass planets at lower metallicities have higher [C/Fe] ratios than stars without planets at the same metallicity, in the same way as has previously been found for {$\alpha$} elements. Finally, the elemental C/O ratios for the vast majority of our stars are below 0.8 when using the oxygen line at 6158 {\AA}, however, the forbidden oxygen line at 6300 {\AA} provides systematically higher C/O values (going above 1.2 in a few cases) which also show a dependence on Teff. Moreover, by using different atmosphere models the C/O ratios can have a non-negligible difference for cool stars. Therefore, C/O ratios should be scaled to a common solar reference in order to correctly evaluate its behaviour. We find no significant differences in the distribution of C/O ratios for the different populations of planet hosts, except when comparing the stars without detected planets with the stars hosting Jupiter-type planets. However, we note that this difference might be caused by the different metallicity distributions of both populations. Conclusions: The derivation of homogeneous abundances from high-resolution spectra in samples that are modest in size is of great utility in constraining models of Galactic chemical evolution. The combination of these high-quality data with the long-term study of planetary presence in our sample is crucial for achieving an accurate understanding of the impact of stellar chemical composition on planetary formation mechanisms.

  abstract = {The cold dark matter picture predicts an abundance of substructure within the Galactic halo. However, most substructures host no stars and can only be detected indirectly. Stellar streams present a promising probe of this dark substructure. These streams arise from tidally stripped star clusters or dwarf galaxies, and their low dynamical temperature and negligible self-gravity give them a sharp memory of gravitational perturbations caused by passing dark substructures. For this reason, perturbed stellar streams have been the subject of substantial study. While previous studies have been largely numerical, we show here that in the diffusion regime - where stream stars are subjected to many small velocity kicks - stream perturbations can be understood on a fully analytic level. In particular, we derive how the (three-dimensional) power spectrum of the substructure density field determines the power spectrum of the (one-dimensional) density of a stellar stream. Our analytic description supplies a clear picture of the behaviour of stream perturbations in response to a perturbing environment, which may include contributions from both dark and luminous substructure. In particular, stream perturbations grow in amplitude initially, settle into a steady state, and ultimately decay. By directly relating stellar stream perturbations to the surrounding matter distribution, this analytic framework represents a versatile new tool for probing the nature of dark matter through astrophysical observations.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that using up to seven stellar abundance ratios can place observational constraints on the star formation histories (SFHs) of Local Group dSphs, using Sculptor dSph as a test case. We use a one-zone chemical evolution model to fit the overall abundance patterns of {$\alpha$} elements (which probe the core-collapse supernovae that occur shortly after star formation), s-process elements (which probe AGB nucleosynthesis at intermediate delay times), and iron-peak elements (which probe delayed Type Ia supernovae). Our best-fit model indicates that Sculptor dSph has an ancient SFH, consistent with previous estimates from deep photometry. However, we derive a total star formation duration of {\textasciitilde}0.9 Gyr, which is shorter than photometrically derived SFHs. We explore the effect of various model assumptions on our measurement and find that modifications to these assumptions still produce relatively short SFHs of duration {$\lessequivlnt$}1.4 Gyr. Our model is also able to compare sets of predicted nucleosynthetic yields for supernovae and AGB stars, and can provide insight into the nucleosynthesis of individual elements in Sculptor dSph. We find that observed [Mn/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] trends are most consistent with sub-M Ch Type Ia supernova models, and that a combination of "prompt" (delay times similar to core-collapse supernovae) and "delayed" (minimum delay times {$\greaterequivlnt$}50 Myr) r-process events may be required to reproduce observed [Ba/Mg] and [Eu/Mg] trends.},

  abstract = {The stellar masses of galaxies are measured using integrated light via several methods -- however, few of these methods were designed for low-mass (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}{\textbackslash}rm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$) "dwarf" galaxies, whose properties (e.g., stochastic star formation, low metallicity) pose unique challenges for estimating stellar masses. In this work, we quantify the precision and accuracy at which stellar masses of low-mass galaxies can be recovered using UV/optical/IR photometry. We use mock observations of 469 low-mass galaxies from a variety of models, including both semi-empirical models (GRUMPY, UniverseMachine-SAGA) and cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations (MARVELous Dwarfs and FIRE-2), to test literature color-\$M\_{\textbackslash}star/L\$ relations and multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) mass estimators. We identify a list of "best practices" for measuring stellar masses of low-mass galaxies from integrated photometry. These include updated prescriptions for stellar mass based on \$g-r\$ color and WISE 3.4 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m luminosity, which are less systematically biased than literature calibrations and can recover true stellar masses of low-mass galaxies with \${\textbackslash}sim0.1\$ dex precision. When using SED fitting to estimate stellar mass, we find that the form of the assumed star formation history can induce significant biases: parametric SFHs can underestimate stellar mass by as much as \${\textbackslash}sim0.4\$ dex, while non-parametric SFHs recover true stellar masses with insignificant offset (\$-0.03{\textbackslash}pm0.11\$ dex). However, we also caution that non-informative dust attenuation priors may introduce \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ uncertainties of up to \${\textbackslash}sim0.6\$ dex.},

The model is applied to structures on galactic scales (normal and dwarfs spiral galaxies) and on clusters of galaxies scales. Our analysis suggest that angular momentum and dynamical friction are able, on galactic scales, to overcome the competing effect of AC eliminating the cusp. The slope of density profile of inner halos flattens with decreasing halo mass and the profile is well approximated by a Burkert's profile. In order to obtain the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, starting from the profiles obtained from our model, the magnitude of angular momentum and dynamical friction must be reduced with respect to the values predicted by the model itself. The rotation curves of four lower sideband galaxies from Gentile et al. are compared to the rotation curves obtained by the model in the present paper obtaining a good fit to the observational data. The time evolution of the density profile of a galaxy of 108-109 M sun shows that after a transient steepening, due to the AC, the density profile flattens to {$\alpha$} sime 0. On cluster scales we observe a similar evolution of the dark matter (DM) density profile but in this case the density profile slope flattens to {$\alpha$} sime 0.6 for a cluster of sime1014 M sun. The total mass profile, differently from that of DM, shows a central cusp well fitted by an NFW model.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study how the dark matter density profiles of dwarf galaxies in the mass range 108-1010 M{$\odot$} are modified by the interaction of the dwarf galaxy with neighbouring structures, and by the changing baryon fraction in dwarf galaxies. With this aim, and referring to an earlier paper by Del Popolo, we determine the density profiles of the dwarf galaxies, taking into account the effect of tidal interaction with neighbouring structures, the effects of ordered and random angular momentum, dynamical friction, the response of dark matter haloes to the condensation of baryons and the effects produced by the presence of baryons. As already shown in the earlier paper, the slope of the density profile of inner haloes flattens with decreasing halo mass, and the profile is well approximated by a Burkert profile. We thus treat the angular momentum generated by tidal torques and the baryon fraction as a parameter in order to understand how the latter influences the density profiles. The analysis shows that dwarf galaxies that have suffered a smaller tidal torque (and consequently have smaller angular momentum) are characterized by steeper profiles with respect to dwarf galaxies subject to higher torque. Similarly, dwarf galaxies that have a smaller baryon fraction also have steeper profiles than those that have a larger baryon fraction. When tidal torquing is shut down and baryons are not present, the density profile is very well approximated by an Einasto profile, similarly to dwarf galaxies obtained in dissipationless N-body simulations. Then, we apply the result of the previous analysis to the dark matter halo rotation curves of three different dwarfs: NGC 2976, which is known to have a flat inner core; NGC 5949, which has a profile intermediate between a cored and a cuspy one; and NGC 5963, which has a cuspy profile. After calculating the baryon fraction, which is {$\simeq$}0.1 for the three galaxies, we fitted the rotation curves, changing the value of the angular momentum. NGC 2976 has a higher value of ordered angular momentum ({$\lambda\simeq$} 0.04) than NGC 5949 ({$\lambda\simeq$} 0.025). For NGC 5963, a very steep profile can be obtained with a low value of {$\lambda$} ({$\lambda\simeq$} 0.02) and also by decreasing the value of the random angular momentum. For NGC 2976, the tidal interaction with M81 could also have influenced the inner part of the density profile. Finally, we show how the inner density profile correlates with the tidal index for dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies given by Karachentsev et al.},

The PLC technique is calibrated by applying it to random distributions of points matching the observed global two-dimensional surface density distributions of the five galaxies. Comparison of these results shows that stars are locally distributed at random in four of these dwarf spheroidals under study, and no aggregates of stars, above the noise, are identified (excluding the obvious globular clusters). Special attention is given to the putative cluster 6 of Fornax, which we can explain as a random fluctuation of the stellar surface density. Deep CCD data of the central regions of Ursa Minor and Draco are used to place limits on possible massive black holes in these systems. No excess of stars is found in the centre of Draco, giving a limit on any central black hole of {$<$}3x10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_solar. For Ursa Minor, a non-random clump of stars is identified near the centre of the galaxy. If this clump were the signature of a black hole, as postulated by Strobel \& Lake, the black hole mass would be less than {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_solar. This is insufficient to explain the apparently high mass-to-light ratio of Ursa Minor, but significant enough to warrant further investigation.},

We attempt to constrain the mass-transfer efficiency for short-period massive binaries undergoing case A mass transfer. Methods: We present a grid of about 20 000 detailed binary evolution tracks with primary masses 3.5-35\{M\}{$\odot$}, orbital periods 1-5 days at a metallicity Z = 0.004, assuming both conservative and non-conservative mass transfer. We perform a systematic comparison, using least-squares fitting, of the computed models with a sample of 50 double-lined eclipsing binaries in the Small Magellanic Cloud, for which fundamental stellar parameters have been determined. About 60\% of the systems are currently undergoing slow mass transfer. Results: In general we find good agreement between our models and the observed detached systems. However, for many of the semi-detached systems the observed temperature ratio is more extreme than our models predict. For the 17 semi-detached systems that we are able to match, we find a large spread in the best fitting mass-transfer efficiency; no single value of {$\beta$} can explain all systems. We find a hint that initially wider systems tend to fit better to less conservative models. We show the need for more accurate temperature determinations and we find that determinations of surface abundances of nitrogen and carbon can potentially constrain the mass-transfer efficiency further.

We present a modified observational test of common-envelope evolution, based on the observation of the 13CO bands at 2.3739 and 2.4037 mu m, which is insensitive to spectral contamination by star-spots.},

  abstract = {We use dark matter only and full hydrodynamical Constrained Local Universe Simulations of the formation of the Local Group to study the density profile of subhaloes of the simulated Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. We show that the Einasto model provides the best description of the subhaloes' density profile, as opposed to the more commonly used Navarro, Frenk \& White profile or any generalization of it. We further find that the Einasto shape parameter nE is strongly correlated with the total subhalo mass, pointing towards the notion of a non-universality of the subhaloes' density profile. We observe that the effect of mass-loss due to tidal stripping, in both the dark matter only and the hydrodynamical run, is the reduction of the shape parameter nE between the infall and the present time. Assuming now that the dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) of our Galaxy follow the Einasto profile and using the maximum and minimum values of nE from our hydrodynamical simulation as a gauge, we can improve the observational constraints on the Rmax-Vmax pairs obtained for the brightest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. When considering only the subhaloes with -13.2 {$\lessequivlnt$} MV {$\lessequivlnt$} -8.8, i.e. the range of luminosity of the classical dwarfs, we find that all our simulated objects are consistent with the observed dSphs if their haloes follow the Einasto model with 1.6 {$\lessequivlnt$} nE {$\lessequivlnt$} 5.3. The numerically motivated Einasto profile for the observed dSphs will alleviate the recently presented `massive failures' problem.},

  abstract = {We use a suite of 31 simulated galaxies drawn from the MaGICC project to investigate the effects of baryonic feedback on the density profiles of dark matter haloes. The sample covers a wide mass range: 9.4 {\texttimes} 109 {$<$} Mhalo/ M{$\odot$} {$<$} 7.8 {\texttimes} 1011, hosting galaxies with stellar masses in the range 5.0 {\texttimes} 105 {$<$} M*/ M{$\odot$} {$<$} 8.3 {\texttimes} 1010, i.e. from dwarf to L*. The galaxies are simulated with blastwave supernova feedback and, for some of them, an additional source of energy from massive stars is included. Within this feedback scheme we vary several parameters, such as the initial mass function, the density threshold for star formation, and energy from supernovae and massive stars. The main result is a clear dependence of the inner slope of the dark matter density profile, {$\alpha$} in {$\rho$} {$\propto$} r{$\alpha$}, on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, M*/Mhalo. This relation is independent of the particular choice of parameters within our stellar feedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp versus core formation. When M*/Mhalo is low, {$\lessequivlnt$}0.01 per cent, energy from stellar feedback is insufficient to significantly alter the inner dark matter density, and the galaxy retains a cuspy profile. At higher stellar-to-halo mass ratios, feedback drives the expansion of the dark matter and generates cored profiles. The flattest profiles form where M*/Mhalo {$\sim$} 0.5 per cent. Above this ratio, stars formed in the central regions deepen the gravitational potential enough to oppose the supernova-driven expansion process, resulting in cuspier profiles. Combining the dependence of {$\alpha$} on M*/Mhalo with the empirical abundance matching relation between M* and Mhalo provides a prediction for how {$\alpha$} varies as a function of stellar mass. Further, using the Tully-Fisher relation allows a prediction for the dependence of the dark matter inner slope on the observed rotation velocity of galaxies. The most cored galaxies are expected to have Vrot {$\sim$} 50 km s-1, with {$\alpha$} decreasing for more massive disc galaxies: spirals with Vrot {$\sim$} 150 km s-1 have central slopes {$\alpha$} {$\leq$} -0.8, approaching again the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This novel prediction for the dependence of {$\alpha$} on disc galaxy mass can be tested using observational data sets and can be applied to theoretical modelling of mass profiles and populations of disc galaxies.},

  abstract = {Aims. The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) represents a challenge for some globular cluster (GC) formation models, because an exceptionally high fraction of its stellar mass is locked in its GC system. In order to shed light on our understanding of GC formation, we aim to constrain the amount of stellar mass that Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW). Methods. Exploiting the flexibility of effective multi-component N-body simulations and relying on state-of-the-art estimates of Fornax's orbital parameters, we study the evolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally justified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr. Results. We find that, though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of stellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most eccentric orbit considered. Conclusions. We conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal stripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass of the GC system of the Fornax dSph and we discuss quantitatively the implications for GC formation scenarios.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic study of the density profiles of {$\Lambda$}CDM halos, focusing on the outer regions, 0.1 {$<$} r/R vir {$<$} 9. We show that the median and mean profiles of halo samples of a given peak height exhibit significant deviations from the universal analytic profiles discussed previously in the literature, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, at radii r {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.5R 200m. In particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median density profiles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply than predicted. The steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r {$\approx$} R 200m, and its absolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate, reaching slopes of -4 and steeper. Importantly, we find that the outermost density profiles at r {$>$}{\textasciitilde} R 200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are rescaled by R 200m. This self-similarity indicates that radii defined with respect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure and evolution of the outer profiles. However, the inner density profiles are most self-similar when radii are rescaled by R 200c. We propose a new fitting formula that describes the median and mean profiles of halo samples selected by their peak height or mass accretion rate with accuracy {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 10\% at all radii, redshifts, and masses we studied, r {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 9R vir, 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 6, and M vir {$>$} 1.7 {\texttimes} 1010 h -1 M {$\odot$}. We discuss observational signatures of the profile features described above and show that the steepening of the outer profile should be detectable in future weak-lensing analyses of massive clusters. Such observations could be used to estimate the mass accretion rate of cluster halos.},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are powerful tools in the study of galactic evolution. As the most numerous galaxies in the universe, they probe a diverse range of environments: some exist in near-isolation, allowing us to study how a galaxy's evolution depends on its intrinsic properties. Others have been accreted by larger galaxies and show the impact of environmental processes such as tidal stripping. Because dwarf galaxies have shallow potential wells, these processes leave strong signatures in their star formation histories (SFHs). We use state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the evolution of dwarf galaxies in Local Group analogues. Their SFHs are remarkably diverse, but also show robust average trends with stellar mass and environment. Low- mass isolated dwarfs (10{\textasciicircum}5 {$<$} M{$\ast$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}6) form all of their stars in the first few Gyr, whereas their more massive counterparts have extended star formation histories, with many of the most massive dwarfs (10{\textasciicircum}7 {$<$} M{$\ast$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}9) continuing star formation until the present day. Satellite dwarfs exhibit similar trends at early and intermediate times, but with substantially suppressed star formation in the last {$\sim$} 5 Gyr, likely as a result of gas loss due to tidal and ram-pressure stripping after entering the haloes of their primaries. These simple mass and environmental trends are in good agreement with the derived SFHs of Local Group dwarfs whose photometry reaches the oldest main sequence turnoff. SFHs of galaxies with less deep data show deviations from these trends, but this may be explained, at least in part, by the large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter, the limited sample size, and the large uncertainties of the inferred SFHs.},

  abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multi-zone chemical evolution models which include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-{$\alpha$} sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial t-1 power law.},

  abstract = {A new theory for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies identifies encounters between dwarf disk galaxies and somewhat larger dwarfs as the likely source. Dwarf spheroids are dark-matter-dominated low luminosity galaxies in the nearby Universe and their origin is one of the outstanding puzzles of how galaxies form. Previous models are relevant only to dwarf spheroidals orbiting close to a giant galaxy like the Milky Way or Andromeda, and are ruled out as general theories because of the existence of dwarfs in the outskirts of the Local Group. In the new model simulations, encounters between dwarf galaxies in small groups excite a 'resonant stripping' process that transforms them into dwarf spheroidals before they are accreted by systems like the Milky Way. Within this framework, dwarf spheroidals should form and interact in pairs or small groups, leaving detectable long stellar streams and tails.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for generating equilibrium models of spherical systems of collisionless particles that are finite in extent, but whose central regions resemble dark matter haloes from cosmological simulations. This method involves iteratively removing unbound particles from a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile truncated sharply at some radius. The resulting models are extremely stable, and thus provide a good starting point for N-body simulations of isolated haloes. We provide a code to generate such models for NFW and a variety of other common density profiles. We then develop an analytic approximation to this truncated distribution function. Our method proceeds by analogy with the King model, truncating and shifting the original distribution function of an infinitely extended NFW profile in energy space. We show that the density profiles of our models closely resemble the tidally truncated density profiles seen previously in studies of satellite evolution. Pursuing this analogy further with a series of simulations of tidal mass-loss, we find that our models provide a good approximation to the full distribution function of tidally stripped systems, thus allowing theoretically motivated phase-space calculations for such systems.},

  abstract = {In order to backward integrate the orbits of Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies, much effort has been invested in recent years to constrain their initial phase-space coordinates. Yet equally important are the assumptions on the potential that the dwarf galaxies experience over time, especially given the fact that the MW is currently accreting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In this work, using a dark-matter-only zoom-in simulation, we test whether the use of common parametric forms of the potential is adequate to successfully backward integrate the orbits of the subhaloes from their present-day positions. We parametrize the recovered orbits and compare them with those from the simulations. We find that simple symmetric parametric forms of the potential fail to capture the complexities and the inhomogeneities of the true potential experienced by the subhaloes. More specifically, modelling a recent massive accretion like that of the LMC as a sum of two spherical parametric potentials leads to substantial errors in the recovered parameters of the orbits. These errors rival those caused due to (a) a 30 per cent uncertainty in the virial mass of the MW and (b) not modelling the potential of the recently accreted massive satellite. Our work suggests that (i) the uncertainties in the parameters of the recovered orbits of some MW dwarfs may be underestimated and that (ii) researchers should characterize the uncertainties inherent to their choice of integration techniques and assumptions of the potential against cosmological zoom-in simulations of the MW, which include a recently accreted LMC.},

The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

We measure homogeneous distances to all systems via isochrone fitting and find good agreement (\${\textbackslash}le\$ 2\%) for the 18 UFDs that have literature RR Lyrae distances. From the ensemble of SFHs, we find: (i) an average quenching time (here defined as the lookback time by which 80\% of the stellar mass formed, \${$\tau\_$}\{80\}\$) of 12.48 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.18 Gyr ago (\$z = 4.6\_\{-0.5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.6\}\$), which is compatible with reionization-based quenching scenarios; and (ii) modest evidence of a delay (\${\textbackslash}lesssim\$ 800 Myr) in quenching times of UFDs thought to be satellites of the LMC or on their first infall, relative to long-term Galactic satellites, which is consistent with previous findings. We show that robust SFH measurement via the ancient main sequence turnoff (MSTO) requires a minimum effective luminosity (i.e., luminosity within the observed field of view) of \$M\_V {\textbackslash}leq -2.5\$, which corresponds to \${\textbackslash}sim\$100 stars around the MSTO. We also find that increasing the S/N above \${\textbackslash}sim\$100 at the MSTO does not improve SFH precision, which remains dominated by stochastic effects associated with the number of available stars. A main challenge driving the precision of UFD SFHs is limitations in the accuracy of foreground dust maps. We make all photometry catalogs public as the first data release of a larger HST archival program targeting all dwarf galaxies within \${\textbackslash}sim\$1.3 Mpc.},

  abstract = {We present the evolution of the structure of relaxed cold dark matter (CDM) haloes in the cosmology from the Planck satellite. Our simulations cover five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. Because of the increased matter density and power spectrum normalization the concentration-mass relation in the Planck cosmology has a {$\sim$}20 per cent higher normalization at redshift z = 0 compared to Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe cosmology. We confirm that CDM haloes are better described by the Einasto profile; for example, at scales near galaxy half-light radii CDM haloes have significantly steeper density profiles than implied by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) fits. There is a scatter of {$\sim$}0.2 dex in the Einasto shape parameter at fixed halo mass, adding further to the diversity of CDM halo profiles. The evolution of the concentration-mass relation in our simulations is not reproduced by any of the analytic models in the literature. We thus provide a simple fitting formula that accurately describes the evolution between redshifts z = 5 and 0 for both NFW and Einasto fits. Finally, the observed concentrations and halo masses of spiral galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts are in good agreement with our simulations, suggesting only mild halo response to galaxy formation on these scales.},

Our analysis draws on the six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of {$\greaterequivlnt$}23,000 luminous red giant stars, for which we previously determined precise parallaxes using a data-driven model that combines spectral data from APOGEE with photometric information from WISE, 2MASS, and Gaia. We derive the circular velocity curve with the Jeans equation assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential. At the location of the Sun we determine the circular velocity with its formal uncertainty to be vc(R{$\odot$} ) = (229.0+/- 0.2) km s-1 with systematic uncertainties at the {$\sim$}2\%-5\% level. We find that the velocity curve is gently but significantly declining at (-1.7 {\textpm} 0.1) km s-1 kpc-1, with a systematic uncertainty of 0.46 km s-1 kpc-1, beyond the inner 5 kpc. We exclude the inner 5 kpc from our analysis due to the presence of the Galactic bar, which strongly influences the kinematic structure and requires modeling in a nonaxisymmetric potential. Combining our results with external measurements of the mass distribution for the baryonic components of the Milky Way from other studies, we estimate the Galaxy's dark halo mass within the virial radius to be Mvir = (7.25+/- 0.26){\textbackslash}cdot 1011 M{$\odot$} and a local dark matter density of {$\rho$} dm(R{$\odot$} ) = 0.30+/- 0.03 GeV cm-3.},

  abstract = {Aims: We constrain the role of different Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) channels in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy by studying the abundances of nickel in Galactic stars. We investigated four different SN Ia sub-classes, including the classical single-degenerate near-Chandrasekhar mass (Mch) SN Ia, the fainter SN Iax systems associated with He accretion from the companion, as well as two sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-Mch) SN Ia channels. The latter include the double detonation of a white dwarf accreting helium-rich matter and violent white dwarf mergers. Methods: The chemical abundances in Galactic stars were determined using Gaia eDR3 astrometry and photometry and high-resolution optical spectra. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) models of Fe and Ni were used in the abundance analysis. We included new delay-time distributions arising from the different SN Ia channels in models of the Galactic chemical evolution, as well as recent yields for core-collapse supernovae and asymptotic giant branch stars. The data-model comparison was performed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that allowed us to explore the entire parameter space allowed by the diversity of explosion mechanisms and the Galactic SN Ia rate, taking the uncertainties of the observed data into account. Results: We show that NLTE effects have a non-negligible impact on the observed [Ni/Fe] ratios in the Galactic stars. The NLTE corrections to Ni abundances are not large, but strictly positive, lifting the [Ni/Fe] ratios by {$\sim$} + 0.15 dex at [Fe/H] -2. We find that the distributions of [Ni/Fe] in LTE and in NLTE are very tight, with a scatter of {$\lessequivlnt$}0.1 dex at all metallicities. This supports earlier work. In LTE, most stars have scaled solar Ni abundances, [Ni/Fe] {$\approx$} 0, with a slight tendency for sub-solar [Ni/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H]. In NLTE, however, we find a mild anti-correlation between [Ni/Fe] and metallicity, and slightly elevated [Ni/Fe] ratios at [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -1.0. The NLTE data can be explained by models of the Galactic chemical evolution that are calculated with a substantial fraction, {$\sim$}75\%, of sub-Mch SN Ia.},

  abstract = {We examine the effects of stellar feedback and bursty star formation on low-mass galaxies (Mstar = 2 {\texttimes} 106 - 5 {\texttimes} 1010 M{$\odot$}) using the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. While previous studies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we investigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration, size evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows drive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales via two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming, producing young stars that migrate {$\sim$}1 kpc within their first 100 Myr, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the global potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce several dramatic effects. First, galaxies' effective radii can fluctuate by factors of {$>$}2 over {$\sim$}200 Myr, and these rapid size fluctuations can account for much of the observed scatter in the radius at fixed Mstar. Second, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat stellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This age-dependent radial migration mixes---and even inverts---intrinsic age and metallicity gradients. Thus, the galactic-archaeology approach of calculating radial star formation histories from stellar populations at z = 0 can be severely biased. These effects are strongest at Mstar {$\approx$} 107-9.6 M{$\odot$}, the same regime where feedback most efficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of stellar kinematics in low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback models and test baryonic solutions to small-scale problems in {$\Lambda$}CDM.},

  abstract = {Star formation in galaxies is triggered by a combination of processes, including gravitational instabilities, spiral wave shocks, stellar compression, and turbulence compression. Some of these persist in the far outer regions, where the column density is far below the threshold for instabilities, making the outer disk cutoff somewhat gradual. We show that in a galaxy with a single exponential gas profile the star formation rate can have a double exponential, with a shallow one in the inner part and a steep one in the outer part. Such double exponentials have been observed recently in the broadband intensity profiles of spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies. The break radius in our model occurs slightly outside the threshold for instabilities, provided the Mach number for compressive motions remains of order unity to large radii. The ratio of the break radius to the inner exponential scale length increases for higher surface brightness disks because the unstable part extends farther out. This is also in agreement with observations. Galaxies with extended outer gas disks that fall more slowly than a single exponential, such as 1/R, can have their star formation rate scale approximately as a single exponential with radius, even out to 10 disk scale lengths. H{$\alpha$} profiles should drop much faster than the star formation rate as a result of the rapidly decreasing ambient density.},

It is shown that the eccentricity and the observed ultraviolet excess are strongly correlated. The stars with the largest excess (i.e., lowest metal abundance) are invariably moving in highly elliptical orbits, whereas stars with little or no excess move in nearly circular orbits. Correlations also exist between the ultraviolet excess and the W-velocity. Finally, the excess and the angnlar momentum are correlated; stars with large ultraviolet excesses have small angular momenta. These correlations are discussed in terms of the dynamics of a collapsing galaxy. The data require that the oldest stars were formed out of gas falling toward the galactic center in the radial direction and collapsing from the halo onto the plane. The collapse was very rapid and only a few times 108 years were required for the gas to attain circular orbits in equilibrium (i e., gravitational attraction balanced by centrifugal acceleration). The scale of the collapse is tentatively estimated to be at least 10 in the radial direction and 25 in the Z-direction. The initial contraction must have begun near the time of formation of the first stars, some 1010 years ago.},

Tidal mass-losses reshape CDM haloes, leaving behind bound remnants whose characteristic densities are set by the mean density of the host at the pericentre of their respective orbit. The evolution to the final bound remnant state is essentially complete after {\textasciitilde}5 orbits for nearly circular orbits, while reaching the same remnant requires, for the same pericentre, {\textasciitilde}25 and {\textasciitilde}40 orbits for eccentric orbits with 1:5 and 1:20 pericentre-to-apocentre ratios, respectively. The density profile of tidal remnants is fully specified by the fraction of mass lost, and approaches an exponentially truncated Navarro-Frenk-White profile in the case of heavy mass-loss. Resolving tidal remnants requires excellent numerical resolution; poorly resolved subhaloes have systematically lower characteristic densities and are more easily disrupted. Even simulations with excellent spatial and time resolution fail when the final remnant is resolved with fewer than 3000 particles. We derive a simple empirical model that describes the evolution of the mass and the density profile of the tidal remnant applicable to a wide range of orbital eccentricities and pericentric distances. Applied to the Milky Way, our results suggest that 108-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\$ haloes accreted \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ ago on 1:10 orbits with pericentric distance \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ should have been stripped to 0.1-1 per cent of their original mass. This implies that estimates of the survival and structure of such haloes (the possible hosts of ultra-faint Milky Way satellites) based on direct cosmological simulations may be subject to substantial revision.},

  abstract = {The clumpiness of dark matter on sub-kpc scales is highly sensitive to the tidal evolution and survival of subhaloes. In agreement with previous studies, we show that N-body realisations of cold dark matter subhaloes with centrally-divergent density cusps form artificial constant-density cores on the scale of the resolution limit of the simulation. These density cores drive the artificial tidal disruption of subhaloes. We run controlled simulations of the tidal evolution of a single subhalo where we repeatedly reconstruct the density cusp, preventing artificial disruption. This allows us to follow the evolution of the subhalo for arbitrarily large fractions of tidally stripped mass. Based on this numerical evidence in combination with simple dynamical arguments, we argue that cuspy dark matter subhaloes cannot be completely disrupted by smooth tidal fields. Modelling stars as collisionless tracers of the underlying potential, we furthermore study the tidal evolution of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using a model of the Tucana III dwarf as an example, we show that tides can strip dwarf galaxies down to sub-solar luminosities. The remnant micro-galaxies would appear as co-moving groups of metal-poor, low-mass stars of similar age, embedded in sub-kpc dark matter subhaloes.},

Many of these objects are inferred to be young, low in mass, and relatively unreddened, but detailed analysis of their high quality spectra will not be possible until the advent of future facilities. In this paper, we shed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low-mass galaxy by presenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra of Q2343-BX418, an L* galaxy at z = 2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio and unusual properties: BX418 is young ({$<$}100 Myr), low mass (M sstarf {\textasciitilde} 109 M sun), low in metallicity (Z {\textasciitilde} 1/6 Z sun), and unreddened (E(B - V) {\textasciitilde}= 0.02, UV continuum slope {$\beta$} = -2.1). We infer a metallicity 12 + log(O/H) = 7.9 {\textpm} 0.2 from the rest-frame optical emission lines. We also determine the metallicity via the direct, electron temperature method, using the ratio O III] {$\lambda\lambda$}1661, 1666/[O III] {$\lambda$}5007 to determine the electron temperature and finding 12 + log(O/H) = 7.8 {\textpm} 0.1. These measurements place BX418 among the most metal-poor galaxies observed in emission at high redshift. The rest-frame UV spectrum, which represents {\textasciitilde}12 hr of integration with the Keck telescope, contains strong emission from Ly{$\alpha$} (with rest-frame equivalent width 54 {\AA}), He II {$\lambda$}1640 (both stellar and nebular), C III] {$\lambda\lambda$}1907, 1909 and O III] {$\lambda\lambda$}1661, 1666. The C IV/C III] ratio indicates that the source of ionization is unlikely to be an active galactic nucleus. Analysis of the He II, O III], and C III] line strengths indicates a very high ionization parameter log U {\textasciitilde} -1, while Ly{$\alpha$} and the interstellar absorption lines indicate that outflowing gas is highly ionized over a wide range of velocities. It remains to be determined how many of BX418's unique spectral features are due to its global properties, such as low metallicity and dust extinction, and how many are indicative of a short-lived phase in the early evolution of an otherwise normal star-forming galaxy.

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to model the tidal evolution of dark matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies embedded in cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White subhaloes. Tides gradually peel off stars and dark matter from a subhalo, trimming it down according to their initial binding energy. This process strips preferentially particles with long orbital times, and comes to an end when the remaining bound particles have crossing times shorter than a fraction of the orbital time at pericentre. The properties of the final stellar remnant thus depend on the energy distribution of stars in the progenitor subhalo, which in turn depends on the initial density profile and radial segregation of the initial stellar component. The stellar component may be completely dispersed if its energy distribution does not extend all the way to the subhalo potential minimum, although a bound dark remnant may remain. These results imply that 'tidally limited' galaxies, defined as systems whose stellar components have undergone substantial tidal mass-loss, neither converge to a unique structure nor follow a single tidal track. On the other hand, tidally limited dwarfs do have characteristic sizes and velocity dispersions that trace directly the characteristic radius (rmx) and circular velocity (Vmx) of the subhalo remnant. This result places strong upper limits on the size of satellites whose unusually low velocity dispersions are often ascribed to tidal effects. In particular, the large size of kinematically cold 'feeble giant' satellites like Crater 2 or Antlia 2 cannot be explained as due to tidal effects alone in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter scenario.},

With a stellar mass of \$16{\textasciicircum}\{+6\}\_\{-5\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and a half-light radius of \$3{\textbackslash}pm1\$ pc, it is either the darkest galaxy ever discovered or the faintest self-gravitating star cluster known to orbit the Galaxy. Its line-of-sight velocity dispersion suggests the presence of dark matter, although current measurements are inconclusive because of the unknown contribution to the dispersion of potential binary stars. We use N-body simulations to show that, if self-gravitating, the system could not survive in the Milky Way tidal field for more than a single orbit (roughly 0.4 Gyr), which strongly suggests that the system is stabilized by the presence of large amounts of dark matter. If UMa3/U1 formed at the centre of a {\textasciitilde}\$10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ cuspy LCDM halo, its velocity dispersion would be predicted to be of order {\textasciitilde}1 km/s. This is roughly consistent with the current estimate, which, neglecting binaries, places \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm los\}\$ in the range 1 to 4 km/s. Because of its dense cusp, such a halo should be able to survive the Milky Way tidal field, keeping UMa3/U1 relatively unscathed until the present time. This implies that UMa3/U1 is in all likelihood the faintest and densest dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, with important implications for alternative dark matter models, and for the minimum halo mass threshold for luminous galaxy formation in the LCDM cosmology.},

  abstract = {The cuspy central density profiles of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes make them highly resilient to disruption by tides. Self-interactions between dark matter particles, or the cycling of baryons, may result in the formation of a constant-density core that would make haloes more susceptible to tidal disruption. We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW)-like `cored' subhaloes in the tidal field of a massive host, and identify the criteria and time-scales for full disruption. Our results imply that the survival of Milky Way satellites places constraints on the sizes of dark matter cores. We find that no subhaloes with cores larger than 1~per\,cent of their initial NFW scale radius can survive for a Hubble time on orbits with pericentres \$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim\} 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$. A satellite like Tucana~3, with pericentre \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 3.5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$, must have a core size smaller than \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 2{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\$ to survive just three orbital periods on its current orbit. The core sizes expected in self-interacting dark matter models with a velocity-independent cross-section~of \$1{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm{\textasciicircum}2\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ seem incompatible with ultrafaint satellites with small pericentric radii, such as Tuc~3, Seg~1, Seg~2, Ret~2, Tri~2, and Wil~1, as these should have fully disrupted if accreted on to the Milky Way \$\{{\textbackslash}gtrsim\} 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ ago. These results suggest that many satellites have vanishingly small core sizes, consistent with CDM cusps. The discovery of further Milky Way satellites on orbits with small pericentric radii would strengthen these conclusions and allow for stricter upper limits on the core sizes.},

  abstract = {A fundamental prediction of the Lambda cold dark matter cosmology is the centrally divergent cuspy density profile of dark matter haloes. Density cusps render cold dark matter haloes resilient to tides, and protect dwarf galaxies embedded in them from full tidal disruption. The hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way may therefore give rise to a population of "microgalaxies"; i.e., heavily stripped remnants of early accreted satellites, which can reach arbitrarily low luminosity. Assuming that the progenitor systems are dark matter dominated, we use an empirical formalism for tidal stripping to predict the evolution of the luminosity, size, and velocity dispersion of such remnants, tracing their tidal evolution across multiple orders of magnitude in mass and size. The evolutionary tracks depend sensitively on the progenitor distribution of stellar binding energies. We explore three cases that likely bracket most realistic models of dwarf galaxies: one where the energy distribution of the most tightly bound stars follows that of the dark matter, and two where stars are defined by either an exponential density or surface brightness profile. The tidal evolution in the size--velocity dispersion plane is quite similar for these three models, although their remnants may differ widely in luminosity. Microgalaxies are therefore best distinguished from globular clusters by the presence of dark matter; either directly, by measuring their velocity dispersion, or indirectly, by examining their tidal resilience. Our work highlights the need for further theoretical and observational constraints on the stellar energy distribution in dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract = {We study the response of mono-energetic stellar populations with initially isotropic kinematics to impulsive and adiabatic changes to an underlying dark matter potential. Half-light radii expand and velocity dispersions decrease as enclosed dark matter is removed. The details of this expansion and cooling depend on the time scale on which the underlying potential changes. In the adiabatic regime, the product of half-light radius and average velocity dispersion is conserved. We show that the stellar populations maintain centrally isotropic kinematics throughout their adiabatic evolution, and their densities can be approximated by a family of analytical radial profiles. Metallicity gradients within the galaxy flatten as dark matter is slowly removed. In the case of strong impulsive perturbations, stellar populations develop power-law-like density tails with radially biased kinematics. We show that the distribution of stellar binding energies within the dark matter halo substantially widens after an impulsive perturbation, no matter the sign of the perturbation. This allows initially energetically separated stellar populations to mix, to the extent that previously chemo-dynamically distinct populations may masquerade as a single population with large metallicity and energy spread. Finally, we show that in response to an impulsive perturbation, stellar populations that are deeply embedded in cored dark matter halos undergo a series of damped oscillations before reaching a virialised equilibrium state, driven by inefficient phase mixing in the harmonic potentials of cored halos. This slow return to equilibrium adds substantial systematic uncertainty to dynamical masses estimated from Jeans modeling or the virial theorem.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of stellar mass segregation driven by collisional relaxation within the potential well of a smooth dark matter halo. This effect is of particular relevance for old stellar systems with short crossing times, where small collisional perturbations accumulate over many dynamical time scales. We run collisional \$N\$-body simulations tailored to the ambiguous stellar systems Ursa Major 3/Unions 1, Delve 1 and Eridanus 3, modelling their stellar populations as two-component systems of high- and low-mass stars, respectively. For Ursa Major 3/Unions 1 (Delve 1), assuming a dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of 10, we find that after 10 Gyr of evolution, the radial extent of its low-mass stars will be twice as large (40 per cent larger) than that of its high-mass stars. We show that weak tides do not alter this relative separation of half-light radii, whereas for the case of strong tidal fields, mass segregation facilitates the tidal stripping of low-mass stars. We further find that as the population of high-mass stars contracts and cools, the number of dynamically formed binaries within that population increases. Our results call for caution when using stellar mass segregation as a criterion to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies, and suggest that mass segregation increases the abundance of massive binaries in the central regions of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract = {Barium (Ba) dwarfs and CH subgiants are the less evolved analogues of Ba and CH giants. They are F- to G-type main-sequence stars polluted with heavy elements by their binary companions when the companion was on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). This companion is now a white dwarf that in most cases cannot be directly detected. We present a large systematic study of 60 objects classified as Ba dwarfs or CH subgiants. Combining radial-velocity measurements from HERMES and SALT high-resolution spectra with radial-velocity data from CORAVEL and CORALIE, we determine the orbital parameters of 27 systems. We also derive their masses by comparing their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary models. We confirm that Ba dwarfs and CH subgiants are not at different evolutionary stages, and that they have similar metallicities, despite their different names. Additionally, Ba giants appear significantly more massive than their main-sequence analogues. This is likely due to observational biases against the detection of hotter main-sequence post-mass-transfer objects. Combining our spectroscopic orbits with the HIPPARCOS astrometric data, we derive the orbital inclination and the mass of the WD companion for four systems. Since this cannot be done for all systems in our sample yet (but should be possible with upcoming Gaia data releases), we also analyse the mass-function distribution of our binaries. We can model this distribution with very narrow mass distributions for the two components and random orbital orientations on the sky. Finally, based on BINSTAR evolutionary models, we suggest that the orbital evolution of low-mass Ba systems can be affected by a second phase of interactions along the red giant branch of the Ba star, which impact the eccentricities and periods of the giants.

For example, Barium (Ba) stars are main-sequence and red-giant stars that accreted mass from the outflows of a former AGB companion, which is now a dim white dwarf (WD). Their orbital properties can help us constrain AGB binary interaction mechanisms and their chemical abundances are a tracer of the nucleosynthesis processes that took place inside the former AGB star. The observational constraints concerning the orbital and stellar properties of Ba stars have increased in the past years, but important uncertainties remained concerning their WD companions. In this contribution, we used HD 76225 to demonstrate that by combining radial-velocity data with Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry, one can accurately constrain the orbital inclinations of these systems and obtain the absolute masses of these WDs, getting direct information about their AGB progenitors via initial-final mass relationships.},

  abstract = {The radial profile of the Sculptor dwarf elliptical galaxy has been determined from automated star counts of UK Schmidt Telescope Unit (UKSTU) plates. The ellipticity (e = 0.34 +/- 0.04) and position angle (P.A.(1950.0) = 95.4{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} +/- 4.3{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum}) are in agreement with those determined by Hodge (1961b). These profiles have been compared with King (1966) models with a range of tidal and core radii. None have been found to give an excellent fit. The best fit achieved has r\_t\_ = 95' and r\_c\_ = 8.9', and has a standard deviation of {$\sigma$} = 0.28 and {$\chi$}{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} = 0.71 (indicating a 95+ \% confidence limit). Accepting these as roughly the correct values for the core and tidal radii, and using other data from the literature, the mass of the Galaxy has been estimated as M\_G\_{\textasciitilde}1.5 +/- 1.1 X 10{\textasciicircum}11{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_. However, the data deviate from this model significantly at large radii, there is an observed overdensity above that expected for the King model beyond R\_maj\_ = 50'. This overdensity is roughly a 2{$\sigma$} effect above the determined background level, and accounts for {\textasciitilde}13\% of the stars counted. This compares well with the results of Innanen and Papp (1979) that {\textasciitilde}10\% of Sculptor's variable stars are found beyond R\_maj\_=53' (Hodge's 1961b value for r\_t\_). Exponential law fits have also been made, following the suggestion (Faber and Lin 1983) that the halo dwarfs are as well fit by exponential laws as are many disk systems. The mean best fit has an exponential scale of {$\gamma$}= -0.053 +/- 0.001 arcmin{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, with a standard deviation of {$\sigma$}= 0.51 and {$\chi$}{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} = 3.8 (still a 95\% + confidence limit). Given the distance modulus of Kunkel and Demers (1977), this implies a physical scale length of r\_e\_{\textasciitilde}0.43 kpc. While the data show the same excess with respect to the exponential law fits as found for the King model fits, this excess is not more severe than is seen in many disk systems. The current data, therefore, do not argue against the hypothesis that the halo dwarfs are the results of ram-pressure stripping of dI systems by the Galactic halo.},

  abstract = {The two-dimensional structure of the Sculptor dwarf elliptical galaxy has been investigated using automated starcounts from United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope Unit (UKSTU) plates. The overall shape of the 2-D contours is similar to that obtained by Hodge (1961b). The existence of nonsymmetric structure in Sculptor has been probed by fitting the starcount data with smooth, symmetric, concentric elliptical contours, then subtracting these fits from the actual data and examining the residual maps. Significant asymmetries are found in the data from all plates, with a maximum density contrast of {\textasciitilde} + 30\% above what is expected for a symmetric fit. All the structure clearly detected is at distances less than or on the order of the core radius. These structures have a physical size of {\textasciitilde}150 pc, and a core crossing time of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8{\textasciicircum} yr. This would seem to imply that they are either bound, or are very young structures. It is possible, however, that they are remnant high-energy star groups, of the sort conjectured by Hodge and Michie (1969), left over from the formation epoch of the system. Calculations following work by Tremaine (1981) indicate that the structures seen should have a decay time due to interaction with the Sculptor core of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10{\textasciicircum} yr, which is roughly the apparent age of the bulk of Sculptor stars (DaCosta 1984). An estimate of the current ratio of kinetic to potential energy for these structures reinforces the supposition that they are currently dissipating in the tidal field of the Sculptor core.},

  abstract = {We present deep echelle spectrophotometry of the Galactic H II region NGC 2579. The data have been taken with the Very Large Telescope Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph in the 3550-10 400 {\AA} range. This object, which has been largely neglected, shows however a rather high surface brightness, a high ionization degree and is located at a galactocentric distance of 12.4 {\textpm} 0.7 kpc. Therefore, NGC 2579 is an excellent probe for studying the behaviour of the gas phase radial abundance gradients in the outer disc of the Milky Way. We derive the physical conditions of the nebula using several emission line-intensity ratios as well as the abundances of several ionic species from the intensity of collisionally excited lines. We also determine the ionic abundances of C2+, O+ and O2+ - and therefore the total O abundance - from faint pure recombination lines. The results for NGC 2579 permit to extend our previous determinations of the C, O and C/O gas phase radial gradients of the inner Galactic disc to larger galactocentric distances. We find that the chemical composition of NGC 2579 is consistent with flattened gradients at its galactocentric distance. In addition, we have built a tailored chemical evolution model that reproduces the observed radial abundance gradients of O, C and N and other observational constraints. We find that a levelling out of the star formation efficiency about and beyond the isophotal radius can explain the flattening of chemical gradients observed in the outer Galactic disc.},

However, so far the asphericity of an individual galaxy's halo has never been robustly established. We use the Jeans equations to define a quantity that robustly characterizes a deviation from rotational symmetry. This quantity is essentially the gravitational torque and it roughly provides the ellipticity projected along the line of sight. We show that the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), with a single epoch of observations combined with those of the Gaia Space Telescope, can distinguish the {$\Lambda$}CDM value of the torque from zero for each Sculptor-like dwarf galaxy with a confidence between 0 and 5{$\sigma$}, depending on the orientation of each halo. With two epochs of observations, TMT will achieve a 5{$\sigma$} discovery of torque and thus asphericity for most such galaxies, thus providing a new and powerful test of the {$\Lambda$}CDM model.},

  abstract = {The tidal tails of globular clusters have been shown to be sensitive to the external tidal field. We investigate how Galactic globular clusters with observed tails are affected by satellite dwarf galaxies by simulating tails in galaxy models with and without dwarf galaxies. The simulations indicate that tidal tails can be subdivided into three categories based on how they are affected by dwarf galaxies: (1) dwarf galaxies perturb the progenitor cluster's orbit (NGC 4590, Pal 1, Pal 5), (2) dwarf galaxies perturb the progenitor cluster's orbit and individual tail stars (NGC 362, NGC 1851, NGC 4147, NGC 5466, NGC 7492, Pal 14, Pal 15), and (3) dwarf galaxies negligibly affect tidal tails (NGC 288, NGC 5139, NGC 5904, Eridanus). Perturbations to a cluster's orbit occur when dwarf galaxies pass within its orbit, altering the size and shape of the orbital and tail path. Direct interactions between one or more dwarf galaxies and tail stars lead to kinks and spurs, however we find that features are more difficult to observe in projection. We further find that the tails of Pal 5 are shorter in the galaxy model with dwarf galaxies as it is closer to apocentre, which results in the tails being compressed. Additional simulations reveal that differences between tidal tails in the two galaxy models are primarily due to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Understanding how dwarf galaxies affect tidal tails allows for tails to be used to map the distribution of matter in dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations within a cold dark matter (DM) cosmology form haloes whose density profiles have a steep inner slope ('cusp'), yet observations of galaxies often point towards a flat central 'core'. We develop a convolutional mixture density neural network model to derive a probability density function (PDF) of the inner density slopes of DM haloes. We train the network on simulated dwarf galaxies from the NIHAO and AURIGA projects, which include both DM cusps and cores: line-of-sight velocities and 2D spatial distributions of their stars are used as inputs to obtain a PDF representing the probability of predicting a specific inner slope. The model recovers accurately the expected DM profiles: \${\textbackslash}sim 82\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the galaxies have a derived inner slope within {\textpm}0.1 of their true value, while \${\textbackslash}sim 98\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ within {\textpm}0.3. We apply our model to four Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies and find results consistent with those obtained with the Jeans modelling based code GRAVSPHERE: the Fornax dSph has a strong indication of possessing a central DM core, Carina and Sextans have cusps (although the latter with large uncertainties), while Sculptor shows a double peaked PDF indicating that a cusp is preferred, but a core cannot be ruled out. Our results show that simulation-based inference with neural networks provide a innovative and complementary method for the determination of the inner matter density profiles in galaxies, which in turn can help constrain the properties of the elusive DM.},

The early part, Gaia EDR3, gives very precise astrometric and photometric properties for nearly two billion sources together with seven million radial velocities from Gaia DR2. The full release, Gaia DR3, will add radial velocities, spectra, light curves, and astrophysical parameters for a large subset of the sources, as well as orbits for solar system objects. Aims: Before the publication of the catalogue, many different data items have undergone dedicated validation processes. The goal of this paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness, accuracy, and precision for the Gaia EDR3 data and to provide recommendations for the use of the catalogue data. Methods: The validation processes include a systematic analysis of the catalogue contents to detect anomalies, either individual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis and comparisons to the previous release as well as to external data and to models. Results: Gaia EDR3 represents a major step forward, compared to Gaia DR2, in terms of precision, accuracy, and completeness for both astrometry and photometry. We provide recommendations for dealing with issues related to the parallax zero point, negative parallaxes, photometry for faint sources, and the quality indicators.},

They are based on more than 2200 low-resolution spectra collected with VIMOS at Very Large Telescope (VLT). The targets are faint (20 {$\lessequivlnt$} V {$\lessequivlnt$} 21.5 mag), but the accuracy at the faintest limit is {$\leq$}9 km s-1. These data were complemented with RV measurements either based on spectra collected with FORS2 and FLAMES/GIRAFFE at VLT or available in the literature. We ended up with a sample of 2748 stars and among them, 1389 are candidate Carina stars. We found that the intermediate-age stellar component shows a well-defined rotational pattern around the minor axis. The western and the eastern side of the galaxy differ by +5 and -4 km s-1 when compared with the main RV peak. The old stellar component is characterized by a larger RV dispersion and does not show evidence of the RV pattern. We compared the observed RV distribution with N-body simulations for a former disky dwarf galaxy orbiting a giant Milky Way-like galaxy. We rotated the simulated galaxy by 60{$^\circ$} with respect to the major axis, we kept the observer on the orbital plane of the dwarf and extracted a sample of stars similar to the observed one. Observed and predicted \{V\}\{rot\}/{$\sigma$} ratios across the central regions are in remarkable agreement. This evidence indicates that Carina was a disky dwarf galaxy that experienced several strong tidal interactions with the Milky Way. Owing to these interactions, Carina transformed from a disky to a prolate spheroid and the rotational velocity transformed into random motions.},

Yield predictions for massive stars are almost exclusively based on single-star models, even though a large fraction interact with a binary companion. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we predict the amount of carbon ejected in the winds and supernovae of single and binary-stripped stars at solar metallicity. We find that binary-stripped stars are twice as efficient at producing carbon (1.5-2.6 times, depending on choices regarding the slope of the initial mass function and black hole formation). We confirm that this is because the convective helium core recedes in stars that have lost their hydrogen envelope, as noted previously. The shrinking of the core disconnects the outermost carbon-rich layers created during the early phase of helium burning from the more central burning regions. The same effect prevents carbon destruction, even when the supernova shock wave passes. The yields are sensitive to the treatment of mixing at convective boundaries, specifically during carbon-shell burning (variations up to 40\%), and improving upon this should be a central priority for more reliable yield predictions. The yields are robust (variations less than 0.5\%) across our range of explosion assumptions. Black hole formation assumptions are also important, implying that the stellar graveyard now explored by gravitational-wave detections may yield clues to better understand the cosmic carbon production. Our findings also highlight the importance of accounting for binary-stripped stars in chemical yield predictions and motivates further studies of other products of binary interactions.},

Binary interactions play a key role in the evolution of many massive stars, yet their impact on chemical yields is poorly understood. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we predict the chemical yields ejected in wind mass loss and the supernovae of single and binary-stripped stars. We do this with a large 162-isotope nuclear network at solar metallicity. We find that binary-stripped stars are more effective producers of the elements than single stars, due to their increased mass loss and an increased chance to eject their envelopes during a supernova. This increased production by binaries varies across the periodic table, with F and K being more significantly produced by binary-stripped stars than single stars. We find that the 12C/13C could be used as an indicator of the conservativeness of mass transfer, as 13C is preferentially ejected during mass transfer while 12C is preferentially ejected during wind mass loss. We identify a number of gamma-ray-emitting radioactive isotopes that may be used to help constrain progenitor and explosion models of core-collapse supernovae with next-generation gamma-ray detectors. For single stars we find that 44V and 52Mn are strong probes of the explosion model, while for binary-stripped stars it is 48Cr. Our findings highlight that binary-stripped stars are not equivalent to two single stars and that detailed stellar modeling is needed to predict their final nucleosynthetic yields.},

  abstract = {Current models of galaxy formation predict that galaxy pairs of comparable magnitudes should become increasingly rare with decreasing luminosity. This seems at odds with the relatively high frequency of pairings among dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. We use literature data to show that {$\sim$}30 per cent of all the satellites of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies brighter than MV = -8 are found in likely physical pairs of comparable luminosity. Besides the previously recognized pairings of the Magellanic Clouds and of NGC 147/NGC 185, other candidate pairs include the Ursa Minor and Draco dwarf spheroidals, as well as the And I/And III satellites of M31. These pairs are much closer than expected by chance if the radial and angular distributions of satellites were uncorrelated; in addition, they have very similar line-of-sight velocities and luminosities that differ by less than three magnitudes. In contrast, the same criteria pair fewer than 4 per cent of satellites in N-body/semi-analytic models that match the radial distribution and luminosity function of Local Group satellites. If confirmed in studies of larger samples, the high frequency of dwarf galaxy pairings may provide interesting clues to the formation of faint galaxies in the current cosmological paradigm.},

  abstract = {The shallow faint-end slope of the galaxy mass function is usually reproduced in {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) galaxy formation models by assuming that the fraction of baryons that turn into stars drops steeply with decreasing halo mass and essentially vanishes in haloes with maximum circular velocities Vmax {$<$} 20-30 km s-1. Dark-matter-dominated dwarfs should therefore have characteristic velocities of about that value, unless they are small enough to probe only the rising part of the halo circular velocity curve (i.e. half-mass radii, r1/2 {$\ll$} 1 kpc). Many dwarfs have properties in disagreement with this prediction: they are large enough to probe their halo Vmax but their characteristic velocities are well below 20 km s-1. These 'cold faint giants' (an extreme example is the recently discovered Crater 2 Milky Way satellite) can only be reconciled with our {$\Lambda$}CDM models if they are the remnants of once massive objects heavily affected by tidal stripping. We examine this possibility using the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group. Assuming that low-velocity-dispersion satellites have been affected by stripping, we infer their progenitor masses, radii, and velocity dispersions, and find them in remarkable agreement with those of isolated dwarfs. Tidal stripping also explains the large scatter in the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation in the dwarf galaxy regime: tides remove preferentially dark matter from satellite galaxies, lowering their accelerations below the amin {\textasciitilde} 10-11 m s-2 minimum expected for isolated dwarfs. In many cases, the resulting velocity dispersions are inconsistent with the predictions from Modified Newtonian Dynamics, a result that poses a possibly insurmountable challenge to that scenario.},

  abstract = {According to the current cosmological paradigm, ``Lambda Cold Dark Matter'' (LambdaCDM), only {\textasciitilde}20\% of the gravitating matter in the universe is made up of ordinary (i.e. baryonic) matter, while the rest consists of invisible dark matter (DM) particles, which existence can be inferred from their gravitational influence on baryonic matter and light. Despite the large success of the LambdaCDM model in explaining the large scale structure of the Universe and the conditions of the early Universe, there has been debate on whether this model can fully explain the observations of low mass (dwarf) galaxies. The Local Group (LG), which hosts most of the known dwarf galaxies, is a unique laboratory to test the predictions of the LambdaCDM model on small scales. I analyze the kinematics of LG members, including the Milky{\textasciitilde}Way-Andromeda (MW-M31) pair and dwarf galaxies, in order to constrain the mass of the LG. I construct samples of LG analogs from large cosmological N-body simulations, according to the following kinematics constraints: (a) the separation and relative velocity of the MW-M31 pair; (b) the receding velocity of dwarf galaxies in the outskirts of the LG. I find that these constraints yield a median total mass of 2*10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} solar masses for the MW and M31, but with a large uncertainty. Based on the mass and the kinematics constraints, I select twelve LG candidates for the APOSTLE simulations project. The APOSTLE project consists of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the LG candidates, using the EAGLE galaxy formation model. I show that dwarf satellites of MW and M31 analogs in APOSTLE are in good agreement with observations, in terms of number, luminosity and kinematics. There have been tensions between the observed masses of LG dwarf spheroidals and the predictions of N-body simulations within the LambdaCDM framework; simulations tend to over-predict the mass of dwarfs. This problem is known as the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem. I find that the enclosed mass within the half-light radii of Galactic classical dwarf spheroidals, is in excellent agreement with the simulated satellites in APOSTLE, and that there is no too-big-to-fail problem in APOSTLE simulations. A few factors contribute in solving the problem: (a) the mass of haloes in hydrodynamical simulations are lower compared to their N-body counterparts; (b) stellar mass-halo mass relation in APOSTLE is different than the ones used to argue for the too-big-to-fail problem; (c) number of massive satellites correlates with the virial mass of the host, i.e. MW analogs with virial masses above {\textasciitilde} 3*10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} solar masses would have faced too-big-to-fail problems; (d) uncertainties in observations were underestimated in previous works. Stellar mass-halo mass relation in APOSTLE predicts that all isolated dwarf galaxies should live in haloes with maximum circular velocity (V\_max) above 20 km/s. Satellite galaxies, however, can inhabit lower mass haloes due to tidal stripping which removes mass from the inner regions of satellites as they orbit their hosts. I examine all satellites of the MW and M31, and find that many of them live in haloes less massive than V\_max=20 km/s. I additionally show that the low mass population is following a different trend in stellar mass-size relation compared to the rest of the satellites or field dwarfs. I use stellar mass-halo mass relation of APOSTLE field galaxies, along with tidal stripping trajectories derived in Penarrubia et al., in order to predict the properties of the progenitors of the LG satellites. According to this prediction, some satellites have lost a significant amount of dark matter as well as stellar mass. Cra{\textasciitilde}II, And{\textasciitilde}XIX, XXI, and XXV have lost 99 per-cent of their stellar mass in the past. I show that the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation of dwarf galaxies in the LG is at odds with MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predictions, whereas tidal stripping can explain the observations very well. I compare observed velocity dispersion of LG satellites with the predicted values by MOND. The observations and MOND predictions are inconsistent, in particular in the regime of ultra faint dwarf galaxies.},

Here, we study the newly discovered tidal tails of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 5466. By means of numerical simulations, we reproduce the shape, direction and surface density of the tidal tails, as well as the structural and kinematical properties of the present-day NGC 5466. Although its tails are very extended in SDSS data ({$\greaterequivlnt$}45{$^\circ$}), NGC 5466 is only losing mass slowly at the present epoch and so can survive for probably a further Hubble time. The effects of tides at perigalacticon and disc-crossing are the dominant causes of the slow dissolution of NGC 5466, accounting for {$\greaterequivlnt$}60 per cent of the mass loss over the course of its evolution. The morphology of the tails provides a constraint on the proper motion -- the observationally determined proper motion has to be refined (within the stated error margin) to match the location of the tidal tails.},

  abstract = {We investigate a wide range of possible evolutionary histories for the recently discovered Bootes dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a Milky Way satellite. By means of N-body simulations, we follow the evolution of possible progenitor galaxies of Bootes for a variety of orbits in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way. The progenitors considered cover the range from dark matter-free star clusters to massive, dark matter-dominated outcomes of cosmological simulations. For each type of progenitor and orbit, we compare the observable properties of the remnant after 10 Gyr with those of Bootes observed today. Our study suggests that the progenitor of Bootes must have been, and remains now, dark matter-dominated. In general, our models are unable to reproduce the observed high velocity dispersion in Bootes without dark matter. Our models do not support time-dependent tidal effects as a mechanism able to inflate significantly the internal velocity dispersion. As none of our initially spherical models is able to reproduce the elongation of Bootes, our results suggest that the progenitor of Bootes may have had some intrinsic flattening. Although the focus of this paper is the Bootes dwarf spheroidal, these models may be of general relevance to understanding the structure, stability and dark matter content of all dwarf spheroidal galaxies.},

The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/.

Nevertheless, the repercussions of the event in the press have been overlooked as a source of information. On the day following the session, newspapers from all over the country covered the news on a debate on "the size of the universe" including the question of the existence of other galaxies. They used metaphors, figures, and quotes from the lecturers and the attendees, reinforcing the rivalry between the Lick and Mount Wilson observatories, with the goal of stirring the imagination of the American public, connecting the existence of other galaxies to pluralist debates. The myth of the debate may not have been based solely on the Bulletin papers; it is a complex process, which involves the media's coverage of the event (from journalists' testimonies in the newspapers articles to public perception).},

Our resolved star analysis reveals a large, low surface brightness stellar stream (MV {$\sim$} -8.5; [Fe/H] = -1.4 {\textpm} 0.15) extending more than 40 kpc north from the galaxy's center. We also find other halo structures, including potentially an additional stream wrap to the south, which may be associated with the main stream. The morphology and derived low metallicities of the streams and shells discovered surrounding NGC 300 are highly suggestive of a past accretion event. Assuming a single progenitor, the accreted system is approximately Fornax-like in luminosity, with an inferred mass ratio to NGC 300 of approximately 1:15. We also present the discovery of a metal-poor globular cluster (GC) (Rproj = 23.3 kpc; MV = -8.99 {\textpm} 0.16; [Fe/H] {$\approx$} -1.6 {\textpm} 0.6) in the halo of NGC 300, the furthest identified GC associated with NGC 300. The stellar structures around NGC 300 represent the richest features observed in a Magellanic Cloud analog to date, strongly supporting the idea that accretion and subsequent disruption is an important mechanism in the assembly of dwarf galaxy stellar halos.},

  abstract = {The Lynx arc, with a redshift of 3.357, was discovered during spectroscopic follow-up of the z=0.570 cluster RX J0848+4456 from the ROSAT Deep Cluster Survey. The arc is characterized by a very red R-K color and strong, narrow emission lines. Analysis of HST WFPC2 imaging and Keck optical and infrared spectroscopy shows that the arc is an H II galaxy magnified by a factor of {\textasciitilde}10 by a complex cluster environment. The high intrinsic luminosity, the emission-line spectrum, the absorption components seen in Ly{$\alpha$} and C IV, and the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum are all consistent with a simple H II region model containing {\textasciitilde}106 hot O stars. The best-fit parameters for this model imply a very hot ionizing continuum (TBB{\textasciitilde}=80,000 K), a high ionization parameter (logU{\textasciitilde}=-1), and a low nebular metallicity (Z/Zsolar{\textasciitilde}=0.05). The narrowness of the emission lines requires a low mass-to-light ratio for the ionizing stars, suggestive of an extremely low metallicity stellar cluster. The apparent overabundance of silicon in the nebula could indicate enrichment by past pair-instability supernovae, requiring stars more massive than {\textasciitilde}140 Msolar.

  abstract = {We present a proper motion measurement for the halo globular cluster Pyxis, using Hubble Space Telescope/ACS data as the first epoch and GeMS/GSAOI Adaptive Optics data as the second, separated by a baseline of {$\sim$}5 years. This is both the first measurement of the proper motion of Pyxis and the first calibration and use of Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics data to measure an absolute proper motion for a faint, distant halo object. Consequently, we present our analysis of the Adaptive Optics data in detail. We obtain a proper motion of \{{$\mu$} \}{$\alpha$} {\textbackslash}cos ({$\delta$} ) = 1.09 {\textpm} 0.31 mas yr-1 and {$\mu$} {$\delta$} = 0.68 {\textpm} 0.29 mas yr-1. From the proper motion and line-of-sight velocity, we find that the orbit of Pyxis is rather eccentric, with its apocenter at more than 100 kpc and its pericenter at about 30 kpc. We also investigate two literature-proposed associations for Pyxis with the recently discovered ATLAS stream and the Magellanic system. Combining our measurements with dynamical modeling and cosmological numerical simulations, we find it unlikely Pyxis is associated with either system. We examine other Milky Way satellites for possible association using the orbit, eccentricity, metallicity, and age as constraints and find no likely matches in satellites down to the mass of Leo II. We propose that Pyxis probably originated in an unknown galaxy, which today is fully disrupted. Assuming that Pyxis is bound and not on a first approach, we derive a 68\% lower limit on the mass of the Milky Way of 0.95 {\texttimes} 1012 M {$\odot$}.},

  abstract = {Supernova and multiple supernova events regulate several structural properties of dwarf galaxies. In particular, they govern the metal enrichment and the energy budget of the ISM; they might induce partial (blowout) or total (blowaway) gas removal from the galaxy; they also regulate the pressure of the ISM, and consequently the morphology of the galactic gaseous body. Significant amounts of dark matter may play an equally important role: the dark matter gravitational potential tends to concentrate baryons towards the centre, thus enhancing both the star formation rate and the metal production. Also, the dynamical properties of the ISM, and the occurrence of a blowout or blowaway, are shown to be determined by the dark matter content. We present detailed analytical/numerical models describing the evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIs), including the above and other effects. The main results are: (i) dwarfs with total masses M{$\lessequivlnt$}5{\texttimes}106 M{$\odot$} are blown away; those with gas masses up to {$\simeq$}109 M{$\odot$} lose mass in an outflow; (ii) metallicities are found to correlate tightly with dark matter content, and are consistent with a range of dark-to-visible mass ratios {$\varphi\approx$}0--30, with about 65 per cent of the dwarfs in the sample having {$\varphi\approx$}0--10; (iii) we predict a lower limit to the oxygen abundance in dIs of 12+log(O/H){$\approx$}7.2; (iv) outflows are not particularly important for the metallicity evolution of dwarf galaxies, and certainly less important than star formation for gas consumption; however, dwarfs with gas masses of a few {\texttimes}108 M{$\odot$} are shown to be the major pollutants of the IGM; (v) the ISM H i velocity dispersion correlates with metallicity and, independently of dark matter, scales as Z3.5. Specific comparisons with well-studied dIs, such as for example Leo A, yield excellent agreement with the data. Based on our results, we discuss a scenario in which late-type and early-type dwarfs had common progenitors in the past, but differences in their total mass forced these objects to follow different evolutionary paths. We therefore consider dI{$\rightarrow$}dE transitions occurring at present cosmic times as very unlikely.},

  abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here, we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in time-scales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial condition generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (GBP - GRP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, GBP, and GRP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, GBP, and GRP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

  abstract = {Context. We present the third data release of the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, Gaia DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of Gaia sources. Aims: We outline the content and the properties of Gaia DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release. Methods: The Gaia DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. Results: The Gaia DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G, GBP, and GRP pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, Gaia EDR3. Gaia DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges GRVS {$<$} 14 and 3100 {$<$} Teff {$<$} 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide GRVS magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community. The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. Gaia DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy. Conclusions: This data release represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in Gaia DR3 will unleash the full potential of Gaia's exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.},

  abstract = {The Wisconsin H{$\alpha$} Mapper has been used to set the first deep upper limits on the intensity of diffuse H{$\alpha$} emission from warm ionized gas in the Draco and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Assuming a velocity dispersion of 15 km s-1 for the ionized gas, we set limits of IH{$\alpha<$}=0.024 R and IH{$\alpha<$}=0.021 R for the Draco and Ursa Minor dSphs, respectively, averaged over our 1{$^\circ$} circular beam. Adopting a simple model for the ionized interstellar medium, these limits translate to upper bounds on the mass of ionized gas of {$<$}{\textasciitilde}10\% of the stellar mass, or {\textasciitilde}10 times the upper limits for the mass of neutral hydrogen. Note that the Draco and Ursa Minor dSphs could contain substantial amounts of interstellar gas, equivalent to all of the gas injected by dying stars since the end of their main star-forming episodes {$>$}{\textasciitilde}8 Gyr in the past, without violating these limits on the mass of ionized gas.},

We discuss the present observational data and their implications for theories of the formation and evolution of both dwarf and giant galaxies. The putative dark matter content of these low-surface-brightness systems is of particular interest, as is their chemical evolution. Surveys for new dwarf spheroidals hidden behind the stars of our Galaxy and those which are not bound to giant galaxies may give new clues as to the origins of this unique class of galaxy.

  abstract = {Indications of disequilibrium throughout the Milky Way (MW) highlight the need for compact, flexible, non-parametric descriptions of phase-space distributions of galaxies. We present a new representation of the current dark matter (DM) distribution and potential derived from N-body simulations of the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) system using basis function expansions (BFEs). We incorporate methods to maximize the physical signal in the representation. As a result, the simulations of 108 DM particles representing the distorted MW(MW+LMC) system can be described by {\textasciitilde}236(2067) coefficients. We find that the LMC induces asymmetric perturbations (odd l, m) to the MW's halo, which are inconsistent with oblate, prolate, or triaxial halos. Furthermore, the energy in high order even modes (l, m {$>$} 2) is similar to average triaxial halos found in cosmological simulations. As such, the response of the MW's halo to the LMC must be accounted for in order to recover the imprints of its assembly history. The LMC causes the outer halo ({$>$}30 kpc) to shift from the disk center of mass (COM) by {\textasciitilde}15-25 kpc at present day, manifesting as a dipole in the BFE and in the radial velocities of halo stars. The shift depends on the LMC's infall mass, the distortion of the LMC's halo and the MW halo response.Within 30 kpc, halo tracers are expected to orbit the COM of the MW's disk, regardless of LMC infall mass.

Elemental abundances are computed using state-of-the-art ionization correction factors. We derive accurate C/O ratios from optical recombination lines. We have re-analysed additional high-quality spectra of 14 PNe from the literature following the same methodology. Comparison with asymptotic giant branch models reveals that about half of the total sample objects are consistent with being descendants of low-mass progenitor stars (M {$<$} 1.5 M{$\odot$}). Given the observed N/O, C/O and He/H ratios, we cannot discard that some of the objects come from more massive progenitor stars (M {$>$} 3-4 M{$\odot$}) that have suffered a mild hot bottom burning. None of the objects seem to be descendant of very massive progenitors. We propose that in most of the planetary nebulae studied here, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been formed through the dissociation of the CO molecule. The hypothesis of a last thermal pulse that turns O-rich PNe into C-rich PNe is discarded, except in three objects, that show C/O {$>$} 1. We also discuss the possibility of an He pre-enrichment to explain the most He-enriched objects. We cannot discard another scenarios like extra mixing, stellar rotation or binary interactions to explain the chemical abundances behaviour observed in our sample.},

We measure both O III] 1666 A and C III] 1909 A in our spectra, enabling us to determine C{\textasciicircum}+2{\textasciicircum}/O{\textasciicircum}+2{\textasciicircum} with relatively small uncertainties. The results from our HST observations show a continuous increase in C/O with increasing O/H, consistent with a power law having an index of 0.43 +/- 0.09 over the range -4.7 to -3.6 in log (O/H). One possible interpretation of this trend is that the most metal-poor galaxies are the youngest and dominated by the products of early enrichment by massive stars, while more metal-rich galaxies show increasing, delayed contributions of carbon from intermediate-mass stars. However, recent evolution models for massive stars including mass loss suggest that the yield of carbon from massive stars may increase with metallicity relative to the yield of oxygen; new chemical evolution models for the solar neighborhood which include nucleosynthesis from these recent stellar evolution models predict a C/O abundance evolution similar to that observed in the metal-poor galaxies. The trend in the C/N ratio increases steadily with O/H in the irregular galaxies, but decreases suddenly for solar neighborhood stars and H II regions. This may indicate that the bulk of nitrogen production is decoupled from the synthesis of carbon in our Galaxy. Our results also suggest that it may not be appropriate to combine abundances in irregular galaxies with those in spiral galaxies to study the evolution of chemical abundances. Our measured C/O ratios in the most metal-poor galaxies are consistent with predictions of nucleosynthesis from massive stars for Weaver \& Woosley's best estimate for the {\textasciicircum}12{\textasciicircum}C({$\alpha$}, {$\gamma$}){\textasciicircum}16{\textasciicircum} O nuclear reaction rate, assuming negligible contamination from carbon produced in intermediate-mass stars in these galaxies. We detect a weak N III] 1750 A multiplet in SMC N88A and obtain interesting upper limits for two other objects. Our 2 {$\sigma$} upper limits on the 1750 A feature indicate that the N{\textasciicircum}+2{\textasciicircum}/0{\textasciicircum}+2{\textasciicircum} ratios in these objects are not significantly larger than the N{\textasciicircum}+{\textasciicircum}/O{\textasciicircum}+{\textasciicircum} ratios measured from optical spectra. This behavior is consistent with predictions of photoionization models, although better detections of N III] are needed to confirm the results.},

  abstract = {We present new long-slit spectra of 12 H II regions in the Scd spiral galaxy NGC 2403. Gas-phase element abundances for O, N, S, Ne, and Ar were estimated using direct measurements of electron temperature based on detections of [O III] {$\lambda$}4363, [S III] {$\lambda$}6312, and [O II] {$\lambda$}7320-7330, and from theoretical photoionization analysis. We find abundance gradients for O/H and N/O of -0.102 +/- 0.009 dex kpc-1 and -0.032 +/- 0.005 dex kpc-1, respectively. The relatively flat N/O gradient suggest a significant source of primary nitrogen. An upper limit for the C/O ratio for one H II region was determined from a Hubble Space Telescope FOS spectrum. A mild outward increasing gradient in S/O is seen at marginal significance (0.03 +/- 0.02 dex kpc-1). We compare the abundance gradient and effective oxygen yield deduced for NGC 2403 with those determined for M33, another Scd galaxy with very similar structural parameters. We find close agreement in most of the chemical properties between NGC 2403 and M33. However, the effective yield for oxygen determined from closed box chemical evolution calculations is higher in M33 than in NGC 2403. The higher yield derived for M33 is similar to the case of H I-deficient Virgo spiral galaxies. We also compare NGC 2403 and M33 with a larger sample of unbarred spirals having abundance measurements. The global metallicity of the spirals correlates well with galaxy luminosity, as already noted from earlier investigations. The O/H gradient per unit disk scale length does not correlate with galaxy luminosity with possibly small intrinsic scatter, suggesting that spiral galaxies are homologous with regard to chemical evolution. The correlation between gas abundances and local surface brightness (mass density) in late-type spirals appears to be described well by chemical evolution models incorporating self-regulating star formation. However, the characteristic abundance at a given value of surface brightness correlates with galaxy luminosity. This suggests that an additional parameter which scales with galaxy mass influences the chemical properties of disks.

  abstract = {We present measurements of the gas-phase abundance ratio C/O in six H II regions in the spiral galaxies M101 and NGC 2403, based on ultraviolet spectroscopy using the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. The ratios of C to O increase systematically with O/H in both galaxies, from log C/O{\textasciitilde}-0.8 at log O/H=-4.0 to log C/O{\textasciitilde}-0.1 at log O/H=-3.4. C/N shows no correlation with O/H. The rate of increase of C/O is somewhat uncertain because of uncertainty as to the appropriate UV reddening law and uncertainty in the metallicity dependence on grain depletions. However, the trend of increasing C/O with O/H is clear, confirming and extending the trend in C/O indicated previously from observations of irregular galaxies. Our data indicate that the radial gradients in C/H across spiral galaxies are steeper than the gradients in O/H. Comparing the data to chemical-evolution models for spiral galaxies shows that models in which the massive star yields do not vary with metallicity predict radial C/O gradients that are much flatter than the observed gradients. The most likely hypothesis at present is that stellar winds in massive stars have an important effect on the yields and thus on the evolution of carbon and oxygen abundances. C-to-O and N-to-O abundance ratios in the outer disks of spirals determined to date are very similar to those in dwarf irregular galaxies. This implies that the outer disks of spirals have average stellar-population ages much younger than those of the inner disks.

We observe that CO is only about one-third the solar system value in galaxies with the lowest abundances (OH less than one-tenth of the solar system value), implying significant evolution of the abundance ratio. If intermediate mass stars have not contributed significant amounts of carbon to the interstellar gas in these galaxies, then the CO ratio reflects nucleosynthetic yields of C and O in massive stars, which are sensitive to the 12C({$\alpha$}, {$\gamma$})16O rate. Based on stellar nucleosynthesis calculations of Weaver \& Woosley (1993, Phys. Rep. 227, 65), the average observed CO ratio in the four galaxies with the lowest abundances implies a reaction rate of 1.7 times the Caughlan \& Fowler 1988 (CF88) ``baseline'' rate for 12C({$\alpha$}, {$\gamma$})16O, with a lower limit of 1.2 times the CF88 rate (95\% confidence level).

The 3.6 {$\mu$}m observations have been acquired with the Infrared Array Camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of the SMHASH program. Mid-infrared light curves for 42 RRLs were obtained, from which we measured Sculptor's distance modulus to be {$\mu$} = 19.60 {\textpm} 0.02 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.04 (photometric) mag (with {$\sigma$}sys = 0.09 mag), using the 3.6 {$\mu$}m empirical period-luminosity relations derived from the Galactic globular cluster M4, or {$\mu$} = 19.57 {\textpm} 0.02 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.04 (photometric) mag (with {$\sigma$}sys = 0.11 mag) using empirical relations in the same passband recently derived from the Large Magellanic Cloud globular cluster Reticulum. Both these measurements are in good agreement with values presented in previous works with Sculptor RRLs in optical bands, and are also consistent with recent near-infrared RR Lyrae results. Best agreement with the literature is found for the latter modulus which is equivalent to a distance of d = 82 {\textpm} 1 (statistical) {\textpm} 2 (photometric) kpc (with {$\sigma$}sys = 4 kpc). Finally, using a subsample of RRLs with spectroscopic metallicities, we demonstrate that these distance estimates are not affected by metallicity effects.},

We adopted different tools based on the Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data (proper motions, Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity relations, spatial distribution, colour-magnitude diagram and stellar isochrone fitting) to discriminate between different types of variable stars, and to identify UMi members. We find a total of 129 RR Lyrae stars and Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) that belong to UMi. We report 47 new RR Lyrae stars (46 bona fide and 1 candidate) and 5 new ACs (4 bona fide and 1 candidate), including new possible members in the extreme periphery of the galaxy at a distance of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 12 half-light radii. We reclassified 13 RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study pipeline for Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS Cep\$amp;\$RRL), using data from the literature and Gaia astrometry and photometry. Specifically, we assigned these 13 DR3 RR Lyrae stars to 10 Anomalous Cepheids and 3 double-mode RR Lyrae (RRd), respectively. From the average luminosity of the RR Lyrae stars we derive for UMi a distance modulus of \$(m-M)\_\{0\}=\$ 19.23 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.09 mag in excellent agreement with the literature. Finally, we investigated whether some of UMi's variable stars might be members of the ultra-faint stellar cluster Mu\{{\~n}\}oz{\textasciitilde}1, that lies at a projected distance of 45 arcmin from UMi's centre. Based on the properties of the variable stars (distances, colours and metallicities), we find unlikely that they belong to the cluster.},

  abstract = {Aims. We used RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia third data release (DR3) to explore the outskirts of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) and update the census of its variable star population. Methods. We adopted different tools based on the Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data (proper motions, Period--Wesenheit--Metallicity relations, spatial distribution, colour--magnitude diagram and stellar isochrone fitting) to discriminate between different types of variable stars, and to identify UMi members. Results. We found a total of 129 RR Lyrae stars and 10 Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) that belong to UMi. In this paper we report 47 new RR Lyrae stars (46 bona fide and 1 candidate) and 5 new ACs (4 bona fide and 1 candidate), including new possible members in the extreme periphery of the galaxy at a distance of {$\sim$}12 half-light radii. We reclassified 13 RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study pipeline for Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS Cep\&RRL), using data from the literature and Gaia astrometry and photometry. Specifically, we assigned these 13 DR3 RR Lyrae stars to ten Anomalous Cepheids and three doublemode RR Lyrae (RRd), respectively. From the average luminosity of the RR Lyrae stars we derive for UMi a distance modulus of (m - M)0 = 19.23 {\textpm} 0.11 mag, in excellent agreement with the literature. Finally, we investigated whether some of UMi's variable stars might be members of the ultra-faint stellar cluster Mu{\~n}oz 1 that lies at a projected distance of 45' from UMi's centre. Based on the properties of the variable stars (distances, colours, and metallicities), we find it unlikely that they belong to the cluster.},

  abstract = {We introduce a set of high-resolution dissipationless simulations that model the Local Group (LG) in a cosmological context: Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations (ELVIS). The suite contains 48 Galaxy-size haloes, each within high-resolution volumes that span 2-5 Mpc in size, and each resolving thousands of systems with masses below the atomic cooling limit. Half of the ELVIS galaxy haloes are in paired configurations similar to the Milky Way (MW) and M31; the other half are isolated, mass-matched analogues. We find no difference in the abundance or kinematics of substructure within the virial radii of isolated versus paired hosts. On Mpc scales, however, LG-like pairs average almost twice as many companions and the velocity field is kinematically hotter and more complex. We present a refined abundance matching relation between stellar mass and halo mass that reproduces the observed satellite stellar mass functions of the MW and M31 down to the regime where incompleteness is an issue, M* {$\sim$} 5 {\texttimes} 105 M{$\odot$}. Within a larger region spanning approximately 3 Mpc, the same relation predicts that there should be {$\sim$}1000 galaxies with M* {$>$} 103 M{$\odot$} awaiting discovery. We show that up to 50 per cent of haloes within 1 Mpc of the MW or M31 could be systems that have previously been within the virial radius of either giant. By associating never accreted haloes with gas-rich dwarfs, we show that there are plausibly 50 undiscovered dwarf galaxies with H I masses {$>$}105 M{$\odot$} within the local volume. The radial velocity distribution of these predicted gas-rich dwarfs can be used to inform follow-up searches based on ultracompact high-velocity clouds found in the ALFALFA survey.},

  abstract = {The origin of the abundance discrepancy, i.e., the fact that abundances derived from recombination lines are larger than those from collisionally excited lines, is one of the key problems in the physics of photoionized nebulae. In this work, we analyze and discuss data for a sample of Galactic and extragalactic H II regions where this abundance discrepancy has been determined. We find that the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) is fairly constant and of order 2 in the available sample of H II regions. This is a rather different behavior than that observed in planetary nebulae, where the ADF shows a much wider range of values. We do not find correlations between the ADF and the O/H, O++/H+ ratios, the ionization degree, Te(High), Te(Low)/Te(High), FWHM, and the effective temperature of the main ionizing stars within the observational uncertainties. These results indicate that whatever mechanism is producing the abundance discrepancy in H II regions it does not substantially depend on those nebular parameters. On the contrary, the ADF seems to be slightly dependent on the excitation energy, a fact that is consistent with the predictions of the classical temperature fluctuations paradigm. Finally, we find that Te-values obtained from O II recombination lines in H II regions are in agreement with those obtained from collisionally excited line ratios, a behavior that is again different from that observed in planetary nebulae. These similar temperature determinations are in contradiction with the predictions of the model based on the presence of chemically inhomogeneous clumps but are consistent with the temperature fluctuations paradigm. We conclude that all the indications suggest that the physical mechanism responsible for the abundance discrepancy in H II regions and planetary nebulae are different.

They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of many important systems, such as X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, and merging gravitational-wave sources. We use our adiabatic mass-loss model to systematically survey intermediate-mass (IM) stars' thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer. The impact of metallicity on the stellar responses and critical mass ratios is explored. Both tables (Z = 0.001) and fitting formulae (Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.02) of the critical mass ratios of IM stars are provided. An application of our results to intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) is discussed. We find that the predicted upper limit to mass ratios, as a function of orbital period, is consistent with the observed IMXBs that undergo thermal or nuclear timescale mass transfer. According to the observed peak X-ray luminosity, L X, we predict the range of L X for IMXBs as a function of the donor mass and the mass-transfer timescale.},

  abstract = {The existence of two kinematically and chemically distinct stellar subpopulations in the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies offers the opportunity to constrain the density profile of their matter haloes by measuring the mass contained within the well-separated half-light radii of the two metallicity subpopulations. Walker and Pe{\~n}arrubia have used this approach to argue that data for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their inner regions and rule out `cuspy' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high statistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor. We test the validity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment) {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all have NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct metallicity subpopulations reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a method analogous to that of Walker and Pe{\~n}arrubia to a sample of 50 simulated dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although multiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based. The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different asphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the density profile are inferred depending on the angle from which the galaxy is viewed.},

In particular the derived value in the core of Fornax (0.3) is much lower than expected for a normal old stellar population. Conversely, the velocity-dispersion measurements in Draco and Ursa Minor appear to still require dark matter in MOND.

For isolated systems with stars of uniform mass, we discuss aspects of evolution up to the point of core collapse: relaxation and its N-dependence, the evolution of the density profile, the development of the velocity dispersion and anisotropy, and the rate of stellar escape.We find that the continuum models (gas and Fokker--Planck) agree quite accurately with N-body simulations in which N is of order of a few hundred. Small deviations from these models are present at small radii and at radii from the half-mass radius outwards. They are probably associated with binary activity and with the development of anisotropy, respectively. As expected, the N-body systems are strongly anisotropic in the outer half of the mass, while in the core the velocity distribution is isotropic to good approximation. Anisotropy has a very important influence on the rate of escape of stars.We also estimate quite reliable values for the coefficient \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ in the Coulomb logarithm ln\$({\textbackslash}gamma N)\$ and the conductivity coefficient C in the gas model of Lynden-Bell \&amp; Eggleton. These are \${\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}simeq 0.11\$ and \$C {\textbackslash}simeq 0.104\$, respectively.},

These values were reached near an age of 20 Myr, when the donor star comes close to the observed luminosity and temperature for epsilon Aurigae A, as a post-RGB/pre-AGB star.

  abstract = {Context. Stellar models and nucleosynthetic yields of primordial to extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars are crucial to interpret the surface abundances of the most metal-poor stars observed and, ultimately, to better understand the earliest stellar populations. In addition, they are key ingredients of Galactic chemical evolution models. Aims: We aim to better characterise the evolution and fates, and determine updated nucleosynthetic yields of intermediate-mass stars between primordial and EMP metallicity (Z = 10-10, 10-8, 10-7, 10-6, and 10-5). We also probed uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of the oldest intermediate-mass stars, namely those related to the treatment of convection and convective boundaries and those related to wind prescriptions during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Methods: We analyse the evolution of models from their main sequence, through the thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB), to the latest stages of their evolution, using the Monash-Mount Stromlo stellar evolution code MONSTAR. The results were post-processed with the code MONSOON, which allowed for the determination of the nucleosynthetic yields of 77 species up to 62Ni. By comparing them to similar calculations existing in the literature, we inspected the effects of input physics on the nucleosynthesis of EMP models. Results: From the evolutionary point of view, as reported in former works, we identified proton ingestion episodes (PIEs) in our lowest-mass lowest-metallicity models. Models of Z = 10-10 and Z = 10-8 in a narrow initial mass range around 5 M{$\odot$} experience the cessation of thermal pulses, and their final fates as type-I1/2 supernovae cannot be discarded. However, the initial mass range of models eventually leading to the formation of type-I1/2 and electron-capture supernovae is considerably reduced compared to former works. All the models of initial mass {$\greaterequivlnt$}6-7 M{$\odot$} experience a corrosive second dredge-up and, analogously to those experiencing PIEs, undergo significant metal enrichment in their envelopes. The associated increase in their opacities allows them to develop a solar-like TP-AGB or TP-super-AGB, ultimately becoming white dwarfs. Except for those undergoing the cessation of thermal pulses, all of our models show the nucleosynthetic signatures of both efficient third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning, with the activation of the NeNa cycle and the MgAlSi chains. This leads to the creation of vast amounts of CNO, with typical [N/Fe] {$>$} 4), and the characteristic abundance signature [N/Fe] {$>$} [C/Fe] {$>$} [O/Fe]. Our nucleosynthetic yields present dramatic differences with respect to recent results existing in the literature for intermediate-mass models of similar metallicities. The reason for these discrepancies lay in the poorly known input physics related to stellar winds and, above all, the treatment of convection and convective boundaries. Nucleosynthetic yield data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/668/A100},

  abstract = {Context. The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey is an ambitious project designed to obtain astrophysical parameters and elemental abundances for 100 000 stars, including large representative samples of the stellar populations in the Galaxy, and a well-defined sample of 60 (plus 20 archive) open clusters. We provide internally consistent results calibrated on benchmark stars and star clusters, extending across a very wide range of abundances and ages. This provides a legacy data set of intrinsic value, and equally a large wide-ranging dataset that is of value for the homogenisation of other and future stellar surveys and Gaia's astrophysical parameters. Aims: This article provides an overview of the survey methodology, the scientific aims, and the implementation, including a description of the data processing for the GIRAFFE spectra. A companion paper introduces the survey results. Methods: Gaia-ESO aspires to quantify both random and systematic contributions to measurement uncertainties. Thus, all available spectroscopic analysis techniques are utilised, each spectrum being analysed by up to several different analysis pipelines, with considerable effort being made to homogenise and calibrate the resulting parameters. We describe here the sequence of activities up to delivery of processed data products to the ESO Science Archive Facility for open use. Results: The Gaia-ESO Survey obtained 202 000 spectra of 115 000 stars using 340 allocated VLT nights between December 2011 and January 2018 from GIRAFFE and UVES. Conclusions: The full consistently reduced final data set of spectra was released through the ESO Science Archive Facility in late 2020, with the full astrophysical parameters sets following in 2022. A companion article reviews the survey implementation, scientific highlights, the open cluster survey, and data products.},

  abstract = {We provide tables of theoretical isochrones in several photometric systems. To this aim, the following steps are followed: (1) first, we re-write the formalism for converting synthetic stellar spectra into tables of bolometric corrections. The resulting formulas can be applied to any photometric system, provided that the zero-points are specified by means of either ABmag, STmag, VEGAmag, or a standard star system that includes well-known spectrophotometric standards. Interstellar absorption can be considered in a self-consistent way. (2) We assemble an extended and updated library of stellar intrinsic spectra. It is mostly based on ``non-overshooting'' ATLAS9 models, suitably extended to both low and high effective temperatures. This offers an excellent coverage of the parameter space of T\_eff, log g, and [M/H]. We briefly discuss the main uncertainties and points still deserving more improvement. (3) From the spectral library, we derive tables of bolometric corrections for Johnson-Cousins-Glass, HST/WFPC2, HST/NICMOS, Washington, and ESO Imaging Survey systems (this latter consisting on the WFI, EMMI, and SOFI filter sets). (4) These tables are used to convert several sets of Padova isochrones into the corresponding absolute magnitudes and colours, thus providing a useful database for several astrophysical applications. All data files are made available in electronic form.},

  abstract = {We investigate the dynamical evolution of the Galactic globular cluster system in considerably greater detail than has been done hitherto, finding that destruction rates are significantly larger than given by previous estimates. The general scheme (but not the detailed implementation) follows Aguilar, Hut, \& Ostriker. For the evolution of individual clusters, we use a Fokker-Planck code including the most important physical processes governing the evolution: two-body relaxation, tidal truncation of clusters, compressive gravitational shocks while clusters pass through the Galactic disk, and tidal shocks due to passage close to the bulge. Gravitational shocks are treated comprehensively, using a recent result by Kundi{\'c} \& Ostriker that the {$<\Delta$}E2{$>$} shock-induced relaxation term, driving an additional dispersion of energies, is generally more important than the usual energy shift term {$<\Delta$}E{$>$}. Various functional forms of the correction factor are adopted to allow for the adiabatic conservation of stellar actions in a presence of transient gravitational perturbation. We use a recent compilation of the globular cluster positional and structural parameters, and a collection of radial velocity measurements. Two transverse to the line-of-sight velocity components were assigned randomly according to the two kinematic models for the cluster system (following the method of Aguilar, Hut, \& Ostriker): one with an isotropic peculiar velocity distribution, corresponding to the present-day cluster population, and the other with the radially preferred peculiar velocities, similar to those of the stellar halo. We use the Ostriker \& Caldwell and the Bahcall, Schmidt, \& Soneira models for our Galaxy. For each cluster in our sample, we calculated its orbits over a Hubble time, starting from the present observed positions and assumed velocities. Medians of the resulting set of peri- and apogalactic distances and velocities are used then as an input for the Fokker-Planck code. Evolution of the cluster is followed up to its total dissolution due to a coherent action of all of the destruction mechanisms. The rate of destruction is then obtained as a median over all the cluster sample, in accord with Aguilar, Hut, \& Ostriker. We find that the total destruction rate is much larger than that given by Aguilar, Hut, \& Ostriker with more than half of the present clusters (52\%-58\% for the Ostriker \& Caldwell model, and 75\%-86\% for the Bahcall, Schmidt, \& Soneira model) destroyed in the next Hubble time. Alternatively put, the typical time to destruction is comparable to the typical age, a result that would follow from (but is not required by) an initially power law distribution of destruction times. We discuss some implications for a past history of the globular cluster system and the initial distribution of the destruction times, raising the possibility that the current population is but a very small fraction of the initial population with the remnants of the destroyed clusters constituting presently a large fraction of the spheroid (bulge + halo) stellar population.},

  abstract = {Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are commonly found in close proximity to the Milky Way and other massive spiral galaxies. As such, their projected stellar ellipticity and extended light distributions are often thought to owe to tidal forces. In this paper, we study the projected stellar ellipticities and faint stellar outskirts of tidally isolated ultra-faints drawn from the 'Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy Formation's Edge' (EDGE) cosmological simulation suite. Despite their tidal isolation, our simulated dwarfs exhibit a wide range of projected ellipticities (0.03 \&lt; {$\varepsilon$} \&lt; 0.85), with many possessing anisotropic extended stellar haloes that mimic tidal tails, but owe instead to late-time accretion of lower mass companions. Furthermore, we find a strong causal relationship between ellipticity and formation time of a UFD, which is robust to a wide variation in the feedback model. We show that the distribution of projected ellipticities in our suite of simulated EDGE dwarfs matches well with a sample of 19 Local Group dwarf galaxies and a sample of 11 isolated dwarf galaxies. Given ellipticity in EDGE arises from an ex-situ accretion origin, the agreement in shape indicates the ellipticities of some observed dwarfs may also originate from a non-tidal scenario. The orbital parameters of these observed dwarfs further support that they are not currently tidally disrupting. If the baryonic content in these galaxies is still tidally intact, then the same may be true for their dark matter content, making these galaxies in our Local Group pristine laboratories for testing dark matter and galaxy formation models.},

  abstract = {A large variance exists in the amplitude of the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation for group- and cluster-size halos. Using a sample of 254 clusters, we show that the magnitude gap between the brightest central galaxy (BCG) and its second or fourth brightest neighbor accounts for a significant portion of this variance. We find that at fixed halo mass, galaxy clusters with a larger magnitude gap have a higher BCG stellar mass. This relationship is also observed in semi-analytic representations of low-redshift galaxy clusters in simulations. This SMHM-magnitude gap stratification likely results from BCG growth via hierarchical mergers and may link the assembly of the halo with the growth of the BCG. Using a Bayesian model, we quantify the importance of the magnitude gap in the SMHM relation using a multiplicative stretch factor, which we find to be significantly non-zero. The inclusion of the magnitude gap in the SMHM relation results in a large reduction in the inferred intrinsic scatter in the BCG stellar mass at fixed halo mass. We discuss the ramifications of this result in the context of galaxy formation models of centrals in group- and cluster-size halos.},

  abstract = {Dwarf satellite galaxies undergo strong tidal forces produced by the main galaxy potential. These forces disturb the satellite and produce asymmetries in its stellar distribution, tidal tail formation, and modifications of the velocity dispersion profiles. Most of these features are observed in the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which is one of the closest satellites of the Milky Way. These features show that UMi is being tidally disrupted and is probably not in virial equilibrium. The high-velocity dispersion of UMi would also be a reflection of this tidal disruption and is not the signature of the large dark matter content that would be deduced if virial equilibrium is assumed. In order to avoid the uncertainty produced when virial equilibrium is assumed in systems in strong tidal fields, we present a new method of calculating the mass-to-luminosity ratio of disrupted dwarf galaxies. This method is based on numerical simulations and only takes into account the shape of the dwarf density profile and the tidal tail brightness, but it does not depend on the kinematics of the dwarf. Applying this method to UMi, we obtain a mass-to-luminosity relation of 12, which is lower than the value obtained assuming virial equilibrium (M/L=60). In addition, if UMi has a large dark matter content, it will be impossible to reproduce a tidal tail as luminous as the one observed.},

  abstract = {As part of a research program exploring how and why dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies depart from the fundamental plane defined by luminous elliptical (E) galaxies, we have analyzed archival Hubble Space Telescope F606W images of a sample of 18 dE galaxy candidates in the Coma Cluster. We model the full radial extent of their light profiles by simultaneously fitting a point-spread function (PSF) convolved S{\'e}rsic R1/n model and, when necessary, either a central point source or a central PSF-convolved Gaussian. Nucleation was detected in all but two of our final sample of 15 dE galaxies. When detected, the luminosities of the central component, Lnuc, scale with the host galaxy luminosity Lgal such that Lnuc=104.76+/-0.10(Lgal/107)0.87+/-0.26. We confirm that the light profiles of the underlying host galaxies display systematic departures from an exponential model that are correlated with the model-independent host galaxy luminosity and are not due to biasing from the nuclear component. The Pearson correlation coefficient between logn and central galaxy surface brightness {$\mu$}0 (excluding the flux from extraneous central components) is -0.83 at a significance level of 99.99\%. Excluding one outlier, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the logarithm of the S{\'e}rsic index n and the host galaxy magnitude is -0.77 at a significance of 99.9\%. We explain the observed relationship between dE galaxy luminosity and the inner logarithmic profile slope {$\gamma$}' as a by-product of the correlation between luminosity and S{\'e}rsic index n. Including, from the literature, an additional 232 dE and E galaxies spanning 10 mag in absolute magnitude M, the dE galaxies are shown to display a continuous sequence with the brighter E galaxies, such that {$\mu$}0 brightens linearly with M until core formation causes the most luminous (MB{$<$}{\textasciitilde}-20.5) E galaxies to deviate from this relation. The different behavior of dE and E galaxies in the M-{$<\mu>$}e (and M-{$\mu$}e) diagram and the {$<\mu>$}e-logRe diagram has nothing to do with core formation and is in fact expected from the continuous and linear relation between M and {$\mu$}0, and M and logn.

Auriga adopts the Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony and includes a comprehensive galaxy formation physics model following the coupled cosmic evolution of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes which has been shown to produce numerically well-converged galaxy properties for Milky Way-mass systems. We describe the first public data release of this augmented suite of Auriga simulations, which includes raw snapshots, group catalogues, merger trees, initial conditions, and supplementary data, as well as public analysis tools with worked examples of how to use the data. To demonstrate the value and robustness of the simulation predictions, we analyse a series of low-redshift global properties that compare well with many observed scaling relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the star-forming (SF) main sequence, and H I gas fraction/disc thickness. Finally, we show that SF gas discs appear to build rotation and velocity dispersion rapidly for \$zrsim 3\$ before they 'settle' into ever-increasing rotation-dispersion ratios (\$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$).

  abstract = {The highly elliptical, 16-year-period orbit of the star S2 around the massive black hole candidate Sgr A* is a sensitive probe of the gravitational field in the Galactic centre. Near pericentre at 120 AU {$\approx$} 1400 Schwarzschild radii, the star has an orbital speed of {$\approx$}7650 km s-1, such that the first-order effects of Special and General Relativity have now become detectable with current capabilities. Over the past 26 years, we have monitored the radial velocity and motion on the sky of S2, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics instruments on the ESO Very Large Telescope, and since 2016 and leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018, with the four-telescope interferometric beam-combiner instrument GRAVITY. From data up to and including pericentre, we robustly detect the combined gravitational redshift and relativistic transverse Doppler effect for S2 of z = {$\Delta\lambda$} / {$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 200 km s-1/c with different statistical analysis methods. When parameterising the post-Newtonian contribution from these effects by a factor f , with f = 0 and f = 1 corresponding to the Newtonian and general relativistic limits, respectively, we find from posterior fitting with different weighting schemes f = 0.90 {\textpm} 0.09{\textbar}stat {\textpm} 0.15{\textbar}sys. The S2 data are inconsistent with pure Newtonian dynamics. This paper is dedicated to Tal Alexander, who passed away about a week before the pericentre approach of S2.},

All of the new dwarfs, with the exception of Leo T, have no detected H I. The majority of dwarf galaxies within {\textasciitilde}270 kpc of the Milky Way or Andromeda are undetected in H I ({$<$}104 M {$\odot$} for Milky Way dwarfs), while those further than {\textasciitilde}270 kpc are predominantly detected with masses {\textasciitilde}105 to 108 M {$\odot$}. Analytical ram-pressure arguments combined with velocities obtained via proper motion studies allow for an estimate of the halo density of the Milky Way at several distances. This halo density is constrained to be greater than 2{\texttimes} 10-4-3 {\texttimes} 10-4 cm-3 out to distances of at least 70 kpc. This is broadly consistent with theoretical models of the diffuse gas in a Milky Way-like halo and is consistent with this component hosting a large fraction of a galaxy's baryons. Accounting for completeness in the dwarf galaxy count, gasless dwarf galaxies could have provided at most 2.1 {\texttimes} 108 M {$\odot$} of H I gas to the Milky Way, which suggests that most of our Galaxy's star formation fuel does not come from accreted small satellites in the current era.},

  abstract = {The gas-deficient dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies present an evolutionary puzzle that we explore in 40 early-type and late-type dwarfs in the Local Group and nearby field. Although dSph's experienced star formation over extended time spans in their youths, today all but one are completely free of detectable interstellar material, even in the Fornax dSph, where stars formed in the last 100 Myr. Combining photometric and spectroscopic stellar metallicity estimates for red giant branches with high-sensitivity H I 21 cm line data from the literature, we show that the well-established offset in luminosity-metallicity relationships for dSph's and dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies exists also when confining the comparison to their old stellar populations: dSph's have higher mean stellar metallicities for a fixed optical luminosity. Evidently star formation in younger dSph's was more vigorous than in the youthful dIrr's, leading to more efficient enrichment. Dwarf galaxies, whose locus in the luminosity-metallicity diagram is consistent with that of dSph's, even when baryonic luminosities are considered, are the ``transition-type dwarfs'' Phoenix, DDO 210, LGS 3, Antlia, and KKR 25. These dwarfs have mixed dIrr/dSph morphologies, low stellar masses, low angular momentum, and H I contents of at most a few 106 Msolar. Unlike dIrr's many transition-type dwarfs would closely resemble dSph's if their gas were removed, as required to become a dSph; they are likely dSph progenitors. As gas removal is the key factor for such a transition, we consider the empirical evidence in favor and against various gas removal processes. We suggest that internal gas removal mechanisms are inadequate and favor ram-pressure stripping to clean the bulk of interstellar matter from galaxies to make dSph's. A combination of initial conditions and environment seems to support the formation of dSph's: nearby dSph's appear to form from small galaxies with active early star formation, whose evolution halts due to externally induced gas loss. Transition-type dwarfs, then, are dSph's that kept their interstellar medium and therefore should replace dSph's in isolated locations where stripping is ineffective.},

  abstract = {My Thesis on "Stellar Population Studies in Nearby Galaxies" covers the development of new tools for stellar population studies, study of young Magellanic Cloud (MC) clusters and their surroundings study of old and intermediate-age populations in two dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. The new tools for population studies include the removal of extinction considering its dependence on stellar temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity (e.g., Grebel \& Roberts 1995), and the determination of age, metallicity, reddening, and distance through simultaneous isochrone fitting to multi-colour photometry (Grebel et al. 1994a). The young SMC cluster NGC 330 is considered a cornerstone for understanding stellar evolution in metal-poor environments. I investigate why previous [Fe/H] determinations for this cluster differ by more than 1 dex and show that they can be largely reconciled when using the same reddening. Different star formation mechanisms seem to have been at work for clusters of similar age. Large-scale star formation processes in the field appear to have triggered the collapse of the molecular clouds that formed NGC 330 and NGC 2004 in the LMC, while the surrounding field of NGC 1818 in the LMC is older than the cluster itself (Grebel 1996). Previous studies found several bright blue stars in young MC clusters to be giants spectroscopically and to lie in the blue Hertzsprung gap suggesting that stellar evolutionary theories may need to be revised and that large age spreads exist in these clusters. We argue (Grebel et al. 1996) that these stars probably are core H burning main-sequence stars that appear as blue stragglers resulting from binary evolution and/or rapid rotation. Many are Be stars and likely rapid rotators. Blue stragglers are also present in NGC 1818, NGC 2004, and NGC 2100 and possibly in all young clusters in the MCs. This suggests that (1) previously inferred large spreads in star formation times are much smaller, (2) ages of young MC clusters may have been systematically underestimated by mistaking blue stragglers for the main-sequence turnoff, and (3) the upper slopes of the IMFs may need to be re-evaluated (Grebel et al. 1996). With an efficient photometric survey method for emission-line stars (Grebel et al. 1992, 1994b, Grebel 1996) we investigated the Be star content of young MC clusters. In NGC 330 also variable Be stars and binaries were identified. NGC 330 and the slightly older NGC 1818 are very rich in Be stars (Grebel 1996), while NGC 2004 has a lower Be star content despite similar metallicity and age. H-alpha luminosity and infrared excess are well correlated though they do not seem to depend on spectral class, while H-alpha luminosity and ultraviolet excess are only weakly correlated. For the Sculptor and Fornax dSph galaxies we established the existence of subpopulations distinct in metallicity and in age (Grebel et al. 1994a). In Sculptor old and metal-poor populations dominate. In Fornax, we find a mixture of intermediate-age field populations and an age gradient with galactocentric radius. The lack of a distinguishable old field population, the metallicity spread in Fornax's globular clusters, and their larger age indicate that they may not have formed in Fornax itself. On the other hand, the suggested 1 Gyr-old subgiants may instead represent a sparsely populated horizontal branch of the missing old field population. Fornax's intermediate-age field population formed over a period of about 10 Gyr and shows considerable enrichment, while Sculptor's populations are comparatively well-confined in ages and abundances. The impact on evolutionary scenarios of the Local Group is discussed.

We run the stellar evolution code MESA to follow the evolution of low-metallicity giant stars that swallow NSs during their late expansion phases and find that in some of the cases the NSs penetrate the core. The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) mass accretion rate onto an NS as it spirals in inside the core is sufficiently high to obtain a neutron-rich ejecta as required for the heavy r-process where the second and third r-process elements are synthesized. Due to the small radius of the NS, the accretion is through an accretion disk and the outflow is in jets (or bipolar disk winds). The r-process nucleosynthesis takes place inside the jets. To account for the r-process abundances in the Galaxy, we require that 1 in 10 cases of an NS entering the envelope of a giant star ends as a CEJSN r-process event.},

Three of the streams, ranging between 3 and 15 kpc in distance and spanning between 37{$^\circ$} and 84{$^\circ$} on the sky, are very narrow and are most probably tidal streams originating in extant or disrupted globular clusters. The fourth stream is much broader, roughly 45 kpc distant, at least 53{$^\circ$} in length, and is most likely the tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy. As each of the streams spans multiple constellations, we extend tradition and designate them the Acheron, Cocytos, Lethe, and Styx streams. At the same distance and apparently embedded in the Styx stream is a {\textasciitilde}1 kpc wide concentration of stars with an apparently similar color-magnitude distribution, which we designate Bootes III. Given its very low surface density, its location within the stream, and its apparently disturbed morphology, we argue that Bootes III may be the progenitor of Styx and in possibly the final throes of tidal dissolution. While the current data do not permit strong constraints, preliminary orbit estimates for the streams do not point to any likely progenitors among the known globular clusters and dwarf galaxies.},

From a set of complete stellar evolution calculations of a 2 Msolar model with Z=0.01 including mass loss, we find that varying either the 14N(p, {$\gamma$})15O or the triple-{$\alpha$} reaction rate within their uncertainties as given in the NACRE compilation results in dredge-up and yields that differ by a factor of 2. Model tracks with a higher rate for the triple-{$\alpha$} rate and a lower rate for the 14N(p, {$\gamma$})15O reaction both show more efficient third dredge-up. New experimental results for the 14N(p, {$\gamma$})15O reaction rates are surveyed, yielding a rate that is about 40\% lower than the tabulated NACRE rate and smaller than NACRE's lower limit. We discuss the possible implications of the revised nuclear reaction rate for stellar evolution calculations that aim to reproduce the observed carbon star formation at low mass, which requires efficient third dredge-up.},

  abstract = {This work explores how assumptions regarding the particle-physics nature of dark matter can alter the evolution of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy and its expansive stellar stream. We run a large suite of \$N\$-body simulations to model the infall of a Sgr-like dwarf, exploring how the presence of dark matter self interactions impacts its evolution. For a scattering cross section of \${\textbackslash}sigma/m\_{\textbackslash}chi = 30 {\textbackslash}text\{ cm\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}text\{/g\}\$ (at orbital velocity scales), these interactions result in significantly less stellar mass and little to no dark matter bound to the progenitor at the present day. To isolate the cause of this mass loss, we introduce a novel technique for controlling which pairs of dark matter simulation particles can interact. This enables us to identify ram-pressure evaporation - the scattering of satellite and host dark matter particles - as the primary source of the enhanced mass loss. The rapid disintegration of the Sgr progenitor when self interactions are allowed alters some key properties of the resulting stellar stream, most dramatically suppressing the presence of a "spur" on the apocenter of the trailing stream arm that correlates with the mass of the satellite at last pericenter. We demonstrate how the effects on the Sgr system scale with the particular choice of self-interaction cross section, which affects the degree of ram-pressure evaporation. These findings generalize beyond the Sgr system, underscoring that dwarf stellar streams and dwarf galaxies with close passages may serve as sensitive probes for dark matter self interactions.},

We study the case of a star with an initial mass of 2M{$\odot$} and a metallicity of Z=0.01, somewhat less than the solar metallicity. The dredge-up of nuclear processed material from the interior of the star and the yield predictions for carbon are sensitive to the rate of the 14N(p,{$\gamma$})15O and triple-{$\alpha$} reactions. These reactions dominate the H- and He-burning shells of stars in this late evolutionary phase. Published uncertainty estimates for each of these two rates propagated through stellar evolution calculations cause uncertainties in carbon enrichment and yield predictions of about a factor of 2. The other important He-burning reaction, 12C({$\alpha$},{$\gamma$})16O, although associated with the largest uncertainty in our study, does not have a significant influence on the abundance evolution compared with other modeling uncertainties. This finding remains valid when the entire evolution from the main sequence to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch is considered. We discuss the experimental sources of the rate uncertainties addressed here and give some outlooks for future work.},

  abstract = {Halo inhabitants are individual stars, stellar streams, star, and globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies. Here we compare the two last categories that include objects of similar stellar mass, which are often studied as self-dynamical equilibrium systems. We discover that the half-light radius of globular clusters depends on their orbital pericentre and total energy, and that Milky Way (MW) tides may explain the observed correlation. We also suggest that the accretion epoch of stellar systems in the MW halo can be calibrated by the total orbital energy, and that such a relation is due to both the mass growth of the MW and dynamical friction affecting mostly satellites with numerous orbits. This calibration starts from the bulge to Kraken, Gaia Sausage Enceladus, Sagittarius stellar systems, and finally to the new coming dwarfs, either or not linked to the vast-polar structure. The most eccentric globular clusters, and dwarfs have their half-light radius scaling as the inverse of their binding energy, and this over more than two decades. This means that earlier arriving satellites are smaller due to the tidal effects of the MW. Therefore, most halo inhabitants appear to have their structural parameters shaped by MW tides, and also by ram-pressure for the most recent arrivals, the dwarf galaxies. The correlations found in this study can be used as tools to further investigate the origin of globular clusters and dwarfs, as well as the assembly history of our Galaxy.},

This approach has seen widespread application in many areas of astrophysics, including but not limited to analyses of the stellar content of galaxies, research on galactic chemical evolution and studies concerning star formation and cosmic re-ionization. In this review, we discuss the role of BPS, its general picture and the various components that comprise it. We pay special attention to the stability criteria for mass transfer in binaries, as this stability largely determines the fate of binary systems.

  abstract = {The growing number of Milky Way satellites detected in recent years has introduced a new focus for stellar abundance analysis. Abundances of stars in satellites have been used to probe the nature of these systems and their chemical evolution. However, for most satellites, only centrally located stars have been examined. This paper presents an analysis of three stars in the Tucana V system, one in the inner region and two at {$\sim$}10- (7--10 half-light radii) from the center. We find a remarkable chemical diversity between the stars. One star exhibits enhancements in rapid neutron-capture elements (an r-I star), and another is highly enhanced in C, N, and O but with low neutron-capture abundances (a CEMP-no star). The metallicities of the stars analyzed span more than 1 dex from [Fe/H] = -3.55 to -2.46. This, combined with a large abundance range of other elements like Ca, Sc, and Ni, confirms that Tuc V is an ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy. The variation in abundances, highlighted by [Mg/Ca] ratios ranging from +0.89 to -0.75, among the stars demonstrates that the chemical enrichment history of Tuc V was very inhomogeneous. Tuc V is only the second UFD galaxy in which stars located at large distances from the galactic center have been analyzed, along with Tucana II. The chemical diversity seen in these two galaxies, driven by the composition of the noncentral member stars, suggests that distant member stars are important to include when classifying faint satellites and that these systems may have experienced more complex chemical enrichment histories than previously anticipated.},

The shape of this distribution is unlike its counterpart in the solar vicinity in that there are relatively more very metal-poor stars in the halo. The halo distribution is compared with that predicted by Larson's hydrodynamical models for elliptical galaxies, and it is found that star formation is less efficient in the galactic halo than in the outer regions of the models. A satisfactory fit to the observations is obtained by making either of two modifications to a simple one-zone model. The first assumes a decrease in the heavy-element yield by a factor of 13 and results in a model with a very large halo mass/disk mass ratio. Alternatively, if gas is temporarily removed from the halo star-forming region and eventually forms a disk, the resulting ratio of halo mass to disk mass becomes 8 percent, and the G-dwarf problem in the solar neighborhood is slightly alleviated.

High-precision radial velocity measurements using four independent data sets spanning the time interval 1981-2002 reveal long-lived residual radial velocity variations superposed on the binary orbit that are coherent in phase and amplitude with a period or 2.48 yr (906 days) and a semiamplitude of 27.5 m s-1. We performed a careful analysis of our Ca II H and K S-index measurements, spectral line bisectors, and Hipparcos photometry. We found no significant variations in these quantities with the 906 day period. We also reanalyzed the Ca II {$\lambda$}8662 measurements of Walker et al., which showed possible periodic variations with the ``planet'' period when first published. This analysis shows that periodic Ca II equivalent width variations were only present during 1986.5-1992 and absent during 1981-1986.5. Furthermore, a refined period for the Ca II {$\lambda$}8662 variations is 2.14 yr, significantly less than the residual radial velocity period. The most likely explanation of the residual radial velocity variations is a planetary-mass companion with Msini=1.7MJ and an orbital semimajor axis of a2=2.13 AU. This supports the planet hypothesis for the residual radial velocity variations for {$\gamma$} Cep first suggested by Walker et al. With an estimated binary orbital period of 57 yr, {$\gamma$} Cep is the shortest period binary system in which an extrasolar planet has been found. This system may provide insights into the relationship between planetary and binary star formation.},

  abstract = {Context. The APOGEE survey has obtained high-resolution infrared spectra of more than 100 000 stars. Deriving chemical abundances patterns of these stars is paramount to piecing together the structure of the Milky Way. While the derived chemical abundances have been shown to be precise for most stars, some calibration problems have been reported, in particular for more metal-poor stars. Aims: In this paper, we aim to (1) re-determine the chemical abundances of the APOGEE+Kepler stellar sample (APOKASC) with an independent procedure, line list and line selection, and high-quality surface gravity information from asteroseismology; and (2) extend the abundance catalogue by including abundances that are not currently reported in the most recent APOGEE release (DR12). Methods: We fixed the Teff and log g to those determined using spectrophotometric and asteroseismic techniques, respectively. We made use of the Brussels Automatic Stellar Parameter (BACCHUS) code to derive the metallicity and broadening parameters for the APOKASC sample. In addition, we derived differential abundances with respect to Arcturus. Results: We have validated the BACCHUS code on APOGEE data using several well-known stars, and stars from open and globular clusters. We also provide the abundances of C, N, O, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S, Al, Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, K, and V for every star and line, and show the impact of line selection on the final abundances. Improvements have been made for some elements (e.g. Ti, Si, V). Additionally, we measure new abundance ratios not found in the current APOGEE release including P, Cu, Rb, and Yb, which are only upper limits at this time, as well as Co and Cr which are promising. Conclusions: In this paper, we present an independent analysis of the APOKASC sample and provide abundances of up to 21 elements. This catalogue can be used not only to study chemical abundance patterns of the Galaxy but also to train data driven spectral approaches which can improve the abundance precision in a restricted dataset, but also full APOGEE sample.

  abstract = {We investigate the evolution of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) halos using N-body simulations of tidal stripping of substructure halos within a static host potential. We find that halos modeled following the Navarro, Frenk, \& White (NFW) mass profile lose mass continuously because of tides from the massive host, leading to the total disruption of satellite halos with small tidal radii. Although mass is predominantly stripped from the outer regions, tidal heating also causes the halo to expand and the central density to decrease after each pericentric passage, when mass loss preferentially occurs. As a result, simple models based on the tidal-limit approximation underestimate significantly the tidal mass loss over several orbits. The equilibrium structure of stripped NFW halos depends mainly on the fraction of mass lost and can be expressed in terms of a simple correction to the original NFW profile. We apply these results to substructure in the Milky Way and conclude that the dark matter halos surrounding its dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites have circular velocity curves that peak well beyond the luminous radius at velocities significantly higher than expected from the stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Our modeling suggests that the true tidal radii of dSphs lie well beyond the putative tidal cutoff observed in the surface brightness profile, suggesting that the latter are not really tidal in origin but rather features in the light profile of limited dynamical relevance. For Draco in particular, our modeling implies that its tidal radius is much larger than derived by Irwin \& Hatzidimitriou, lending support to the interpretation of recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey data by Odenkirchen et al. Similarly, our model suggests that Carina's halo has a peak circular velocity of order {\textasciitilde}55 km s-1, which may help explain how this small galaxy has managed to retain enough gas to undergo several bursts of star formation. Our results imply a close correspondence between the most massive substructure halos expected in a CDM universe and the known satellites of the Milky Way and suggest that only substructure halos with peak circular velocities below 35 km s-1 lack readily detectable luminous counterparts.},

  abstract = {Elements with weak and blended spectral features in stellar spectra are challenging to measure and require specialized analysis methods to precisely measure their chemical abundances. In this work, we have created a catalog of approximately 120,000 giants with high signal-to-noise Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17 (DR17) spectra, for which we explore weak and blended species to measure Na, P, S, V, Cu, Ce, and Nd abundances and 12C/13C isotopic ratios. We employ an updated version of the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High-accuracy Spectra (BACCHUS) code to derive these abundances using the stellar parameters measured by APOGEE's DR17 Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, quality flagging to identify suspect spectral lines, and a prescription for upper limits. Combined, these allow us to provide our BACCHUS Analysis of Weak Lines in APOGEE Spectra catalog of precise chemical abundances for these weak and blended species, which agrees well with the literature and improves upon APOGEE abundances for these elements, some of which are unable to be measured with APOGEE's current, grid-based approach without computationally expensive expansions. This new catalog can be used alongside APOGEE and provides measurements for many scientific applications ranging from nuclear physics to Galactic chemical evolution and Milky Way population studies. To illustrate this we show some examples of uses for this catalog, such as showing that we observe stars with enhanced s-process abundances or that we can use the 12C/13C ratios to explore extra mixing along the red giant branch.},

  abstract = {Context. SDSS-IV APOGEE-2, GALAH, and Gaia-ESO are high-resolution, ground-based, multi-object spectroscopic surveys providing fundamental stellar atmospheric parameters and multiple elemental abundance ratios for hundreds of thousands of stars of the Milky Way. Data from these and other surveys contribute to investigations of the history and evolution of the Galaxy. Aims: We undertake a comparison between the most recent data releases of these surveys to investigate the accuracy and precision of derived parameters by placing the abundances on an absolute scale. We also discuss the correlations in parameter and abundance differences as a function of main parameters. Uncovering the variants provides a basis to continue the efforts of future sky surveys. Methods: Quality samples from the APOGEE-GALAH (15 537 stars), APOGEE-GES (804 stars), and GALAH-GES (441 stars) overlapping catalogs were collected. We investigated the mean variants between the surveys, and linear trends were also investigated. We compared the slope of correlations and mean differences with the reported uncertainties. Results: The average and scatter of vrad, Teff, log g, [M/H], and vmicro, along with numerous species of elemental abundances in the combined catalogs, show that in general there is a good agreement between the surveys. We find large radial velocity scatters ranging from 1.3 km s-1 to 4.4 km s-1 when comparing the three surveys. We observe some weak trends (e.g., in {$\Delta$}Teff vs. {$\Delta$}log g for the APOGEE-GES stars) and a clear correlation in the vmicro - {$\Delta$}vmicro planes in the APOGEE-GALAH common sample. For [{$\alpha$}/H], [Ti/H] (APOGEE-GALAH giants), and [Al/H] (APOGEE-GALAH dwarfs) potential strong correlations are discovered as a function of the differences in the main atmospheric parameters, and we also find weak trends for other elements. Conclusions: In general we find good agreement between the three surveys within their respective uncertainties. However, there are certain regimes in which strong variants exist, which we discuss. There are still offsets larger than 0.1 dex in the absolute abundance scales.},

  abstract = {The evolution of rotating stars with zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses in the range 8-25 Msolar is followed through all stages of stable evolution. The initial angular momentum is chosen such that the star's equatorial rotational velocity on the ZAMS ranges from zero to {\textasciitilde}70\% of breakup. The stars rotate rigidly on the ZAMS as a consequence of angular momentum redistribution during the pre-main-sequence evolution. Redistribution of angular momentum and chemical species are then followed as a consequence of Eddington-Sweet circulation, Solberg-H{\o}iland instability, the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, and secular and dynamic shear instability. The effects of the centrifugal force on the stellar structure are included. Convectively unstable zones are assumed to tend toward rigid rotation, and uncertain mixing efficiencies are gauged by observations. We find, as noted in previous work, that rotation increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellar envelopes with products of hydrogen burning. We determine, for the first time, the angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along with their detailed chemical structure. Angular momentum loss due to (nonmagnetic) stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum during core hydrogen burning are of crucial importance for the specific angular momentum of the core. Neglecting magnetic fields, we find angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope to be unimportant after core helium burning. We obtain specific angular momenta for the iron core and overlying material of 1016-1017 cm2 s-1. These values are insensitive to the initial angular momentum and to uncertainties in the efficiencies of rotational mixing. They are small enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron core before it collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close to breakup. They are also in the range required for the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. The apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation rates of young pulsars is discussed.},

  abstract = {Stellar mergers lead to diverse phenomena: rejuvenated blue stragglers, magnetised and peculiar stars, transients and nebulae. Using a grid of about 6000 detailed 1D binary evolution models (initial component masses of 0.5-20\${\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at solar metallicity), we investigate which initial binary-star configurations lead to contact and classical common-envelope (CE) phases and assess the likelihood of a subsequent merger. Considering rotation and tides, we identify five mechanisms leading to contact and mergers: runaway mass transfer, \${\textbackslash}text\{L\}\_\{2\}\$-overflow, accretor expansion, tidally-driven orbital decay, and non-conservative mass transfer. At least 40\% of mass-transferring binaries with initial primary masses of 5-20\${\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ enter contact, with {$>$}12\% and {$>$}19\% likely merging and evolving into a classical CE phase, respectively. Classical CE evolution occurs in late Case-B and Case-C binaries for initial mass ratios \$q\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{i\}\}\$ {$<$} 0.15-0.35, stable mass transfer for larger \$q\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{i\}\}\$. Early Case-B binaries enter contact for \$q\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{i\}\}\$ {$<$} 0.15-0.35 and in initially wider Case-A binaries, this occurs for \$q\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{i\}\}\$ {$<$} 0.35. All initially closest Case-A systems form contact binaries. We predict that binaries entering contact with \$q\$ {$<$} 0.5 merge or detach on a thermal timescale, while those formed with \$q\$ {$>$} 0.5 lead to long-lived contact phases. The fact that contact binaries are almost exclusively observed with \$q\$ {$>$} 0.5 confirms our expectations. Our contact, merger and classical CE incidences are lower limits because the mass transfer in our models is non-conservative. In most binaries, the non-accreted mass cannot be ejected and may settle in disks or lead to contact phases and mergers. Overall, contact binaries are a frequent and fascinating result of binary mass transfer of which the exact outcomes still remain to be understood and explored further.},

  abstract = {Radial surface brightness profiles of spiral galaxies are classified into three types: (I) single exponential, or the light falls off with one exponential to a break before falling off (II) more steeply, or (III) less steeply. Profile breaks are also found in dwarf disks, but some dwarf Type IIs are flat or increasing out to a break before falling off. Here we re-examine the stellar disk profiles of 141 dwarfs: 96 dwarf irregulars (dIms), 26 Blue Compact Dwarfs (BCDs), and 19 Magellanic-type spirals (Sms). We fit single, double, or even triple exponential profiles in up to 11 passbands: GALEX FUV and NUV, ground-based UBVJHK and H{$\alpha$}, and Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m. We find that more luminous galaxies have brighter centers, larger inner and outer scale lengths, and breaks at larger radii; dwarf trends with MB extend to spirals. However, the V-band break surface brightness is independent of break type, MB, and Hubble type. Dwarf Type II and III profiles fall off similarly beyond the breaks but have different interiors and IIs break {$\sim$}twice as far as IIIs. Outer Type II and III scale lengths may have weak trends with wavelength, but pure Type II inner scale lengths clearly decrease from the FUV to visible bands whereas Type III inner scale lengths increase with redder bands. This suggests the influence of different star formation histories on profile type, but nonetheless the break location is approximately the same in all passbands. Dwarfs continue trends between profile and Hubble types such that later-type galaxies have more Type II but fewer Type I and III profiles than early-type spirals. BCDs and Sms are over-represented as Types III and II, respectively, compared to dIms.},

  abstract = {In this second paper of a series, we explore the B - V, U - B, and FUV-NUV radial color trends from a multi-wavelength sample of 141 dwarf disk galaxies. Like spirals, dwarf galaxies have three types of radial surface brightness profiles: (I) single exponential throughout the observed extent (the minority), (II) down-bending (the majority), and (III) up-bending. We find that the colors of (1) Type I dwarfs generally become redder with increasing radius, unlike spirals which have a blueing trend that flattens beyond {$\sim$}1.5 disk scale lengths, (2) Type II dwarfs come in six different ``flavors,'' one of which mimics the ``U'' shape of spirals, and (3) Type III dwarfs have a stretched ``S'' shape where the central colors are flattish, become steeply redder toward the surface brightness break, then remain roughly constant beyond, which is similar to spiral Type III color profiles, but without the central outward bluing. Faint (-9 {$>$} MB {$>$} -14) Type II dwarfs tend to have continuously red or ``U'' shaped colors and steeper color slopes than bright (-14 {$>$} MB {$>$} -19) Type II dwarfs, which additionally have colors that become bluer or remain constant with increasing radius. Sm dwarfs and BCDs tend to have at least some blue and red radial color trend, respectively. Additionally, we determine stellar surface mass density ({$\Sigma$}) profiles and use them to show that the break in {$\Sigma$} generally remains in Type II dwarfs (unlike Type II spirals) but generally disappears in Type III dwarfs (unlike Type III spirals). Moreover, the break in {$\Sigma$} is strong, intermediate, and weak in faint dwarfs, bright dwarfs, and spirals, respectively, indicating that {$\Sigma$} may straighten with increasing galaxy mass. Finally, the average stellar surface mass density at the surface brightness break is roughly 1-2 M{$\odot$} pc-2 for Type II dwarfs but higher at 5.9 M{$\odot$} pc-2 or 27 M{$\odot$} pc-2 for Type III BCDs and dIms, respectively.},

To explain the faint subgiant branch of the reddest stars ("MS-a/RG-a" sequence), isochrones for the observed metallicity ([Fe/H] {$\approx$}-0.7) appear to require both a high age ({\textasciitilde}13 Gyr) and enhanced CNO abundances ([CNO/Fe] {$\approx$}0.9). Y {$\approx$} 0.35 must also be assumed in order to counteract the effects of high CNO on turnoff colors and thereby to obtain a good fit to the relatively blue turnoff of this stellar population. This suggests a short chemical evolution period of time ({$<$}1 Gyr) for {$\omega$} Cen. Our intermediate-mass (super-)asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models are able to reproduce the high helium abundances, along with [N/Fe] {\textasciitilde}2 and substantial O depletions if uncertainties in the treatment of convection are fully taken into account. These abundance features distinguish the bMS stars from the dominant [Fe/H] {$\approx$}-1.7 population. The most massive super-AGB stellar models (M ZAMS {$>$}= 6.8 M {$\odot$}, M He, core {$>$}= 1.245 M {$\odot$}) predict too large N enhancements, which limit their role in contributing to the extreme populations. In order to address the observed central concentration of stars with He-rich abundance, we show here quantitatively that highly He- and N-enriched AGB ejecta have particularly efficient cooling properties. Based on these results and on the reconstruction of the orbit of {$\omega$} Cen with respect to the Milky Way, we propose the Galactic plane passage gas purging scenario for the chemical evolution of this cluster. The bMS population formed shortly after the purging of most of the cluster gas as a result of the passage of {$\omega$} Cen through the Galactic disk (which occurs today every {\textasciitilde}40 Myr for {$\omega$} Cen) when the initial mass function of the dominant population had "burned" through most of the Type II supernova mass range. AGB stars would eject most of their masses into the gas-depleted cluster through low-velocity winds that sink to the cluster core due to their favorable cooling properties and form the bMS population. In our discussion we follow our model through four passage events, which could explain some key properties not only of the bMS but also of the MS-a/RGB-a and the s-enriched stars.},

Variations of the evolution as a function of mass, the initial-final mass relation, and lifetimes are summarized.

The evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars is presented.

  abstract = {This thesis attempts to untangle, as best as possible, the importance of internally-driven evolutionary mechanisms relative to externally-driven effects, in shaping the structure and properties of the smallest observable galaxies. All galaxies are influenced by internal processes, such as feedback from star formation and the infall of gas or lack thereof, as well as environmental processes, like tides and ram pressure stripping. The smallest galaxies - dwarfs - are highly susceptible to all such processes, and their resulting structure is the summation of all prior events. I use nearby dwarf galaxies of the Local Group as test cases, focusing on those which are separated from the massive galaxies (like the Milky Way) and can be considered as "isolated''. These dwarfs are observed as part of the Solitary Local (Solo) Dwarf Galaxy Survey. Solo dwarfs will have spent the majority of their time as isolated systems, hence their properties should generally reflect their "intrinsic nature", unperturbed and unaffected by interactions with other systems. This survey was designed to focus on the old stellar populations present in these galaxies, in order to characterize their faint and extended structures. These old stellar populations should carry the hallmarks of the dwarfs' histories. By comparing the observed properties of Solo dwarfs with dwarfs currently in close proximity to a large host galaxy (i.e., the M 31 and Milky Way satellites), it should be possible to determine what aspects of the properties of dwarfs are most affected by environmentally-driven processes. The Local Group is the ideal regime in which to study these faint features, as the dwarfs' close proximity to us presents an opportunity to fully characterize these galaxies. However, the number of dwarfs in the Local Group is limited, with several galaxies (e.g. IC 10 or Sag dSph) being the unique example of their "type" locally observable. This limited sample emphasizes the need for careful, homogeneous observations and analysis, such that comparisons between this small, yet highly diverse, snapshot of galaxies accurately reflects the true nature of these dwarfs. I have homogeneously analyzed the 12 closest Solo dwarfs observable from the northern hemisphere, resulting in a consistently derived dataset. I determine fundamental properties, like distances, and characterize the structure of the dwarfs. I explore the possibility that the dwarfs may be more consistent with a two component profile, rather than one, finding that they are largely well characterized by a single S{\'e}rsic profile. I then compare these isolated dwarfs with the well-studied satellites of the Milky Way and M 31, primarily using two other homogeneous surveys; the MegaCam Survey of Outer Halo Objects and the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey respectively. Examining each property (e.g. ellipticity, central surface brightness, or S{\'e}rsic radius) individually, we find no statistically significant differences between each group. However, when considering parameters in combination (e.g. absolute magnitude as a function of S{\'e}rsic radius), we see increased scatter in the satellite population, indicative of the impact of a massive host galaxy on the dwarfs, likely via tidal effects. The comparison between satellites and isolated dwarfs hones in on the impact of a massive galaxy in close proximity. Of course, processes within and surrounding the dwarf itself can also alter the dwarf. I look at the star formation histories and gas content of the dwarfs to explore the connection between internal and external processes in these small galaxies. Finally, I search for substructure in the form of satellites of dwarf galaxies, globular clusters and extended tidal features, all which inform about the dwarf's isolation, environment and history. Collectively, I generate comprehensive and detailed inspections of Local Group dwarfs and aim to understand them as products of their environment.},

We evaluate the variability of the spread in abundance measurements reported for the same star by different surveys. We also explore the likely association of the star within the Galactic disk, the corresponding observation and abundance determination methods for all catalogs in Hypatia, the influence of specific catalogs on the overall abundance trends, and the effect of normalizing all abundances to the same solar scale. The resulting stellar abundance determinations in the Hypatia Catalog are analyzed only for thin-disk stars with observations that are consistent between literature sources. As a result of our large data set, we find that the stars in the solar neighborhood may reveal an asymmetric abundance distribution, such that a [Fe/H]-rich group near the midplane is deficient in Mg, Si, S, Ca, Sc II, Cr II, and Ni as compared to stars farther from the plane. The Hypatia Catalog has a wide number of applications, including exoplanet hosts, thick- and thin-disk stars, and stars with different kinematic properties.},

The most common approach to measure the IFMR has been to use white dwarfs in clusters. However, it has been shown that wide double white dwarfs can also be used to measure the IFMR using a Bayesian approach. We have observed a large sample of 90 Gaia double white dwarfs using FORS2 on the VLT. Considering 52 DA+DA, DA+DC, and DC+DC pairs, we applied our extended Bayesian framework to probe the IFMR in exquisite detail. Our monotonic IFMR is well constrained by our observations for initial masses of 1-5 M{$\odot$}, with the range 1-4 M{$\odot$} mostly constrained to a precision of 0.03 M{$\odot$} or better. We add an important extension to the framework, using a Bayesian mixture-model to determine the IFMR robustly in the presence of systems departing from single star evolution. We find a large but uncertain outlier fraction of 59 {\textpm} 21 per cent, with outlier systems requiring an additional \$0.70\_\{-0.22\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.40\}\$ Gyr uncertainty in their cooling age differences. However, we find that this fraction is dominated by a few systems with massive components near 0.9 M{$\odot$}, where we are most sensitive to outliers, but are also able to establish four systems as merger candidates.},

In the final data release (internal data release 6) of the Gaia-ESO Survey, we provide the final database containing a large number of products, such as radial velocities, stellar parameters and elemental abundances, rotational velocity, and also, for example, activity and accretion indicators in young stars and membership probability in star clusters for more than 114 000 stars. The spectral analysis is coordinated by a number of working groups (WGs) within the survey, each specialised in one or more of the various stellar samples. Common targets are analysed across WGs to allow for comparisons (and calibrations) amongst instrumental setups and spectral types. Here we describe the procedures employed to ensure all survey results are placed on a common scale in order to arrive at a single set of recommended results for use by all survey collaborators. We also present some general quality and consistency checks performed on the entirety of the survey results. The full Gaia-ESO catalogue is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/676/A129},

  abstract = {The Gaia mission has triggered major developments in the field of Galactic dynamics in recent years, which we discuss in this review. The structure and kinematics of all Galactic components -- disc, bar/bulge and halo -- are now mapped in great detail not only in the Solar neighbourhood, but across a large part of the Milky Way. The dramatic improvements in the coverage and precision of observations revealed various disequilibrium processes, such as perturbations in the Galactic disc and the deformations of the outer halo, which are partly attributed to the interaction with satellite galaxies. The knowledge of the gravitational potential at all scales has also advanced considerably, but we are still far from having a consistent view on the key properties of the Galaxy, such as the bar pattern speed or the mass profile and shape of the dark halo. The complexity and interplay of several dynamical processes makes the interpretation of observational data challenging, and it is fair to say that more theoretical effort is needed to fully reap the fruit of the Gaia revolution.},

  abstract = {Context. Obtaining reliable distance estimates to gas clouds within the Milky Way is challenging in the absence of certain tracers. The kinematic distance approach has been used as an alternative, and it is derived from the assumption of circular trajectories around the Galactic centre. Consequently, significant errors are expected in regions where gas flow deviates from purely circular motions. Aims. We aim to quantify the systematic errors that arise from the kinematic distance method in the presence of a Galactic potential that is non-axisymmetric. We investigated how these errors differ in certain regions of the Galaxy and how they relate to the underlying dynamics. Methods. We performed 2D isothermal hydrodynamical simulation of the gas disk with the moving-mesh code AREPO, adding the capability of using an external potential provided by the AGAMA library for galactic dynamics. We introduced a new analytic potential of the Milky Way, taking elements from existing models and adjusting parameters to match recent observational constraints. Results. In line with results of previous studies, we report significant errors in the kinematic distance estimate for gas close to the Sun along sight lines towards the Galactic centre and anti-centre and associated with the Galactic bar. Kinematic distance errors are low within the spiral arms, as gas resides close to local potential minima and the resulting line-of-sight velocity is similar to what is expected for an axisymmetric potential. Interarm regions exhibit large deviations at any given Galactic radius, and this is caused by the gas being sped up or slowed down as it travels into or out of spiral arms. In addition, we identify 'zones of avoidance' in the lv-diagram, where the kinematic distance method is particularly unreliable and should only be used with caution, and we find a power-law relation between the kinematic distance error and the deviation of the projected line-of-sight velocity from circular motion.},

Here we summarize the current state of our knowledge of the interstellar medium (ISM), including atomic, molecular and ionized gas, along with their dust properties and metals. We also discuss star formation feedback, gas accretion, and mergers with other dwarfs that connect the ISM to the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. We highlight one of the most persistent mysteries: the nature of pervasive gas that is yet undetected as either molecular or cold hydrogen, the ``dark gas''. Here are a few highlights: 1. Significant quantities of HI are in far-outer gas disks. 2. Cold HI in dIrrs would be molecular in the Milky Way, making the chemical properties of star-forming clouds significantly different. 3. Stellar feedback has a much larger impact in dIrrs than in spiral galaxies. 4. The escape fraction of ionizing photons is significant, making dIrrs a plausible source for reionization in the early Universe. 5. Observations suggest a significantly higher abundance of hydrogen (H\$\_2\$ or cold HI) associated with CO in star-forming regions than that traced by the CO alone.},

We also include JHK imaging of 42 of these galaxies. The sample spans a large range in galactic parameters. Ellipse fit axial ratios, inclinations, and position angles are derived, integrated photometry and azimuthally averaged surface photometry profiles are determined, and exponential fits give the central surface brightnesses, scale lengths, and isophotal and half-power radii. These data are used to address the shapes of Im galaxies, look for clues to past interactions in large-scale peculiarities, examine the nature and consequences of bars, study color gradients and large-scale color variations, and compare the exponential disk profiles of the young and old stellar components. For example, color gradients exhibit a great variety and not all passbands are correlated. Bars are associated with higher star formation rates. Many irregulars show a double-exponential radial light profile that is steeper in the outer parts, and these are reproduced by a new model of star formation that is discussed in a companion paper. Some galaxies, primarily BCDs, have double exponentials that are steeper (and bluer) in the inner parts, presumably from centralized star formation. Im-type galaxies have thicker, less prominent dust layers than spiral galaxies because of their lower average surface densities and midplane extinctions.},

  abstract = {The origin of the Lyman {$\alpha$} (Ly{$\alpha$}) emission in galaxies is a long-standing issue: despite several processes known to originate this line (e.g. active galactic nucleus, star formation, cold accretion, shock heating), it is difficult to discriminate among these phenomena based on observations. Recent studies have suggested that the comparison of the ultraviolet (UV) and optical properties of these sources could solve the riddle. For this reason, we investigate the rest-frame UV and optical properties of Abell 2895b, a strongly lensed Ly{$\alpha$} emitter at redshift z {\textasciitilde} 3.7. From this study, we find that our target is a compact (rn {\textasciitilde} 1.2 pkpc) star-forming (star formation rate {$\simeq$}11 M{$\odot$} yr-1) galaxy having a young stellar population. Interestingly, we measure a high ratio of the H{$\beta$} and the UV continuum monochromatic luminosities (L(H{$\beta$})/L(UV) {$\simeq$} 100). Based on tracks of theoretical stellar models (STARBURST99 and BPASS), we can only partially explain this result by assuming a recent ({$\lessequivlnt$}10 Myr), bursty episode of star formation and considering models characterized by binary stars, a top-heavy initial mass function and subsolar metallicities (Z {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.01 Z{$\odot$}). These assumptions also explain the observed low (C/O) abundance of our target ({$\simeq$}0.23(C/O){$\odot$}). By comparing the UV and optical data sets, we find that the Ly{$\alpha$} and UV continuum are more extended ({\texttimes}2) than the Balmer lines, and that the peak of the Ly{$\alpha$} is offset ({$\simeq$}0.6 pkpc). The multiwavelength results of our analysis suggest that the observed Ly{$\alpha$} emission originates from a recent star formation burst, likely taking place in an off-centre clump.},

Global and central mass-to-light ratios were calculated for these galaxies. They range from {\textasciitilde}=10 for Fornax and Sculptor to more than 200 for Draco. It appears plausible that Draco, Ursa Minor, Carina and Sextans contain significant amounts of dark matter, at least under the standard assumptions for the dynamics of these galaxies. However, the errors associated with these estimates remain - often forbiddingly - large, dominated (in most cases) by the errors in the luminosity and velocity dispersion. The possibility of the presence of extra-tidal stars in at least some of the dSphs is also discussed, together with the effect of the Galactic tidal field on the dSphs' morphology. Both Sextans and Sculptor appear to be good candidates for systems in the process of tidal disruption.},

  abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) appear to be some of the most dark matter (DM)-dominated objects in the Universe. Their dynamical masses are commonly derived using the kinematics of stars under the assumption of equilibrium. However, these objects are satellites of massive galaxies (e.g. the Milky Way) and thus can be influenced by their tidal fields. We investigate the implication of the assumption of equilibrium focusing on the Sculptor dSph by means of ad hoc N-body simulations tuned to reproduce the observed properties of Sculptor following the evolution along some observationally motivated orbits in the Milky Way gravitational field. For this purpose, we used state-of-the-art spectroscopic and photometric samples of Sculptor's stars. We found that the stellar component of the simulated object is not directly influenced by the tidal field, while \{{$\approx$} \} 30 - 60\{\{ per cent\}\} of the mass of the more diffuse DM halo is stripped. We conclude that, considering the most recent estimate of the Sculptor proper motion, the system is not affected by the tides and the stellar kinematics represents a robust tracer of the internal dynamics. In the simulations that match the observed properties of Sculptor, the present-day dark-to-luminous mass ratio is {$\approx$}6 within the stellar half-light radius ({$\approx$}0.3 kpc) and {$>$}50 within the maximum radius of the analysed data set ({$\approx$}1.5{$^\circ$}, {$\approx$}2 kpc).},

Studying the trajectories of objects like stars, globular clusters, or satellite galaxies in the Milky Way allows the dark matter halo to be traced but requires reliable models of its gravitational potential. Aims: Realistic, yet simple and fully analytical, models have already been presented in the past. However, improved, as well as new, observational constraints have become available in the meantime, calling for a recalibration of the respective model parameters. Methods: Three widely used model potentials are revisited. By a simultaneous least-squares fit to the observed rotation curve, in-plane proper motion of Sgr A*, local mass/surface density, and the velocity dispersion in Baade's window, parameters of the potentials are brought up-to-date. The mass at large radii - in particular, that of the dark matter halo - is hereby constrained by requiring that the most extreme known halo, blue horizontal-branch star has to be bound to the Milky Way. Results: The Galactic mass models are tuned to yield a very good match to recent observations. The mass of the dark matter halo is - within the limitations of the applied models - estimated in a fully consistent way. As a first application, the trajectory of the hypervelocity star HE 0437-5439 is investigated again to check its suggested origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Conclusions: Despite their simplicity, the presented Milky Way mass models are very able to reproduce all observational constraints. Their analytical and simple form makes them ideally suited for fast and accurate orbit calculations. The LMC cannot be ruled out as HE 0437-5439's birthplace.},

We also analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Spectrograph archival spectra of 10 supergiant H II regions to derive C and Si abundances in a subsample of seven BCGs. The main result of the present study is that none of the heavy element-to-oxygen abundance ratios studied here (C/O, N/O, Ne/O, Si/O, S/O, Ar/O, Fe/O) depend on oxygen abundance for BCGs with 12+logO/H{$<$}=7.6 (Z{$<$}=Zsolar/20). This constancy implies that all of these heavy elements have a primary origin and are produced by the same massive (M{$>$}=10 Msolar) stars responsible for O production. The dispersion of the ratios C/O and N/O in these galaxies is found to be remarkably small, being only +/-0.03 and +/-0.02 dex, respectively. This very small dispersion is strong evidence against any time-delayed production of C and primary N in the lowest metallicity BCGs (secondary N production is negligible at these low metallicities). The absence of a time-delayed production of C and N is consistent with the scenario that galaxies with 12+logO/H{$<$}=7.6 are now undergoing their first burst of star formation, and that they are therefore young, with ages not exceeding 40 Myr. If very low metallicity BCGs are indeed young, this would argue against the commonly held belief that C and N are produced by intermediate-mass (3 Msolar{$<$}=M{$<$}=9 Msolar) stars at very low metallicities, as these stars would not have yet completed their evolution in these lowest metallicity galaxies. In higher metallicity BCGs (7.6{$<$}12+logO/H{$<$}8.2), the abundance ratios Ne/O, Si/O, S/O, Ar/O, and Fe/O retain the same constant value they had at lower metallicities. By contrast, there is an increase of C/O and N/O along with their dispersions at a given O. We interpret this increase as due to the additional contribution of C and primary N production in intermediate-mass stars, on top of that by high-mass stars. The above results lead to the following timeline for galaxy evolution: (1) all objects with 12+logO/H{$<$}=7.6 began to form stars less than 40 Myr ago; (2) after 40 Myr, all galaxies have evolved so that 12+logO/H{$>$}7.6 (3) by the time intermediate-mass stars have evolved and released their nucleosynthetic products (100-500 Myr), all galaxies have become enriched to 7.6{$<$}12+logO/H{$<$}8.2. The delayed release of primary N at these metallicities greatly increases the scatter in N/O; (4) later, when galaxies get enriched to 12+logO/H{$>$}8.2, secondary N production becomes important. BCGs show the same O/Fe overabundance with respect to the Sun ({\textasciitilde}0.4 dex) as Galactic halo stars, suggesting the same chemical enrichment history. We compare heavy elements yields derived from the observed abundance ratios with theoretical yields for massive stars and find general good agreement. However, the theoretical models are unable to reproduce the observed N/O and Fe/O. Further theoretical developments are necessary, in particular to solve the problem of primary nitrogen production in low-metallicity massive stars. We discuss the apparent discrepancy between abundance ratios N/O measured in BCGs and those in high-redshift damped Ly{$\alpha$} galaxies, which are up to 1 order of magnitude smaller. We argue that this large discrepancy may arise from the unknown physical conditions of the gas responsible for the metallic absorption lines in high-redshift damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems. While it is widely assumed that the absorbing gas is neutral, we propose that it could be ionized. In this case, ionization correction factors can boost N/O in damped Ly{$\alpha$} galaxies into the range of those measured in BCGs.},

These responses, as well as the assumption on how liberal the process is, are discussed in terms of the stability of the ensuing mass transfer. The predictions of the theory of mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow are then briefly compared with the observed mass-transferring systems with both degenerate and non-degenerate donors. We conclude with the discussion which cases of mass transfer and which primordial binaries could be responsible for blue stragglers formation via Roche lobe overflow, as well as how this can be enhanced for blue stragglers formed in globular clusters},

During a common envelope phase, the stars temporarily share the same outer layers, with the cores of both stars orbiting inside the same common envelope. This common envelope is sometimes ejected and helps to explain the formation of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, progenitors for type Ia supernovae, and gravitational-wave mergers. Modeling common envelope evolution is a challenging problem, and this important process has typically been described in evolutionary models using very approximate treatments.

  abstract = {Some close-in gaseous exoplanets are nearly in Roche lobe contact, and previous studies show that tidal decay can drive hot Jupiters into contact during the main sequence of their host stars. Improving on a previous model, we present a revised model for mass transfer in a semidetached binary system that incorporates an extended atmosphere around the donor and allows for an arbitrary mass ratio. We apply this new formalism to hypothetical, confirmed, and candidate planetary systems to estimate mass-loss rates and compare with models of evaporative mass loss. Overflow may be significant for hot Neptunes out to periods of {$\sim$}2 days, while for hot Jupiters, it may only be important inward of 0.5 days. We find that CoRoT-24 b may be losing mass at a rate of more than an Earth mass in a gigayear. The hot Jupiter WASP-12 b may lose an Earth mass in a megayear, while the putative planet PTFO8-8695 orbiting a T Tauri star might shed its atmosphere in a few megayears. We point out that the orbital expansion that can accompany mass transfer may be less effective than previously considered because the gas accreted by the host star removes some of the angular momentum from the orbit, but simple scaling arguments suggest that the Roche lobe overflow might remain stable. Consequently, the recently discovered small planets in ultrashort periods ({$<$}1 day) may not be the remnants of hot Jupiters/Neptunes. The new model presented here has been incorporated into Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA).},

We analysed the integrated physical properties of the H II regions of CSWA 20 using temperature- and density-sensitive emission lines. We find the abundance of oxygen to be {$\sim$}1/7 of solar, while carbon is {$\sim$}50 times less abundant than in the Sun. The unusually low C/O ratio may be an indication of a particularly rapid time-scale of chemical enrichment. The wide wavelength coverage of X-shooter gives us access to five different methods for determining the metallicity of CSWA 20, three based on emission lines from H II regions and two on absorption features formed in the atmospheres of massive stars. All five estimates are in agreement, within the factor of {$\sim$}2 uncertainty of each method. The interstellar medium (ISM) of CSWA 20 only partially covers the star-forming region as viewed from our direction; in particular, absorption lines from neutrals and first ions are exceptionally weak. We find evidence for large-scale outflows of the ISM with speeds of up 750 km s-1, similar to the values measured in other high-z galaxies sustaining much higher rates of star formation.},

Nine of these galaxies were subsequently observed with Keck Echellette Spectrograph and Imager and their radial kinematics are presented here. These extend out to the half-light radius Re in the best cases, and beyond Re/2 for all. They reveal a variety of behaviours similar to those of a comparison sample of early-type dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster observed by Toloba et~al. Both samples have similar frequencies of slow and fast rotators, as well as kinematically decoupled cores.

In particular, our `Hubble volume' simulations of {$\tau$}CDM and {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmologies allow the abundance of massive clusters to be predicted with uncertainties well below those expected in all currently planned observational surveys. We show that for a range of CDM cosmologies and for a suitable halo definition, the simulated mass function is almost independent of epoch, of cosmological parameters and of the initial power spectrum when expressed in appropriate variables. This universality is of exactly the kind predicted by the familiar Press-Schechter model, although this model predicts a mass function shape that differs from our numerical results, overestimating the abundance of `typical' haloes and underestimating that of massive systems.},

All major groupings of stars are associated with previously known satellites, and among these is NGC 5466, a distant (16 kpc) globular cluster. NGC 5466 reportedly possesses a long stellar stream, although no individual members of the stream have previously been identified. Using both BHBs and more numerous red giant branch stars cross-matched to Gaia Data Release 2, we identify extended tidal tails from NGC 5466 that are both spatially and kinematically coherent. Interestingly, we find that this stream does not follow the same path as the previous detection at large distances from the cluster. We trace the stream across 31{$^\circ$} of sky and show that it exhibits a very strong distance gradient in the range 10 {$<$} Rhelio {$<$} 30 kpc. We compare our observations to simple dynamical models of the stream and find that they are able to broadly reproduce the overall path and kinematics. The fact that NGC 5466 is so distant, traces a wide range of Galactic distances, has an identified progenitor, and appears to have recently had an interaction with the Galaxy's disc makes it a unique test-case for dynamical modelling of the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are valuable laboratories for dynamical studies related to dark matter and galaxy evolution, yet it is currently unknown just how physically extended their stellar components are. Satellites orbiting the Galaxy's potential may undergo tidal stripping by the host, or alternatively, may themselves have accreted smaller systems whose debris populates the dwarf's own stellar halo. Evidence of these past interactions, if present, is best searched for in the outskirts of the satellite. However, foreground contamination dominates the signal at these large radial distances, making observation of stars in these regions difficult. In this work, we introduce an updated algorithm for application to Gaia data that identifies candidate member stars of dwarf galaxies, based on spatial, colour-magnitude and proper motion information, and which allows for an outer component to the stellar distribution. Our method shows excellent consistency with spectroscopically confirmed members from the literature despite having no requirement for radial velocity information. We apply the algorithm to all {\textasciitilde}60 Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites, and we find nine dwarfs (Bo{\"o}tes 1, Bo{\"o}tes 3, Draco 2, Grus 2, Segue 1, Sculptor, Tucana 2, Tucana 3, and Ursa Minor) that exhibit evidence for a secondary, low-density outer profile. We identify many member stars which are located beyond 5 half-light radii (and in some cases, beyond 10). We argue these distant stars are likely tracers of dwarf stellar haloes or tidal streams, though ongoing spectroscopic follow-up will be required to determine the origin of these extended stellar populations.},

  abstract = {We review the systematic properties of ``dwarf'' elliptical (dE) galaxies, focussing on the relation between ``normal'' and ``dwarf'' ellipticals. In recent years, this relation has been described as ``dichotomy'' -- based essentially on a discontinuity in central surface brightness. We show that, outside of 300 pc from the centre, the S{\'e}rsic profile parameters vary continuously from ``normal'' to ``dwarf'' ellipticals. The ``dichotomy'' is indeed restricted to the very central part, where differences also exist among ``normal'' ellipticals (E). Bright, nucleated dE's closely resemble ``normal'' E's also in their clustering and flattening properties. They may be genuine ellipticals, having no present-day late-type dwarf precursor from which they could have been manufactured. The non-nucleated dE's ("dwarf spheroidals") may be a different breed.},

The new auto\_diff module implements automatic differentiation in MESA, an enabling capability that alleviates the need for hard-coded analytic expressions or finite-difference approximations. We significantly enhance the treatment of the growth and decay of convection in MESA with a new model for time-dependent convection, which is particularly important during late-stage nuclear burning in massive stars and electron-degenerate ignition events. We strengthen MESA's implementation of the equation of state, and we quantify continued improvements to energy accounting and solver accuracy through a discussion of different energy equation features and enhancements. To improve the modeling of stars in MESA, we describe key updates to the treatment of stellar atmospheres, molecular opacities, Compton opacities, conductive opacities, element diffusion coefficients, and nuclear reaction rates. We introduce treatments of starspots, an important consideration for low-mass stars, and modifications for superadiabatic convection in radiation-dominated regions. We describe new approaches for increasing the efficiency of calculating monochromatic opacities and radiative levitation, and for increasing the efficiency of evolving the late stages of massive stars with a new operator-split nuclear burning mode. We close by discussing major updates to MESA's software infrastructure that enhance source code development and community engagement.},

  abstract = {Stars that formed with an initial mass of over 50 M {$\odot$} are very rare today, but they are thought to be more common in the early Universe. The fates of those early, metal-poor, massive stars are highly uncertain. Most are expected to directly collapse to black holes, while some may explode as a result of rotationally powered engines or the pair-creation instability. We present the chemical abundances of J0931+0038, a nearby low-mass star identified in early follow-up of the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which preserves the signature of unusual nucleosynthesis from a massive star in the early Universe. J0931+0038 has a relatively high metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.76 {\textpm} 0.13) but an extreme odd--even abundance pattern, with some of the lowest known abundance ratios of [N/Fe], [Na/Fe], [K/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ba/Fe]. The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source. An extensive search through nucleosynthesis predictions finds a clear preference for progenitors with initial mass {$>$}50 M {$\odot$}, making J0931+0038 one of the first observational constraints on nucleosynthesis in this mass range. However, the full abundance pattern is not matched by any models in the literature. J0931+0038 thus presents a challenge for the next generation of nucleosynthesis models and motivates the study of high-mass progenitor stars impacted by convection, rotation, jets, and/or binary companions. Though rare, more examples of unusual early nucleosynthesis in metal-poor stars should be found in upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.},

We compute star formation rates using the Schmidt law, assuming the same gas infall dependence on surface density as used in models of the Milky Way. We build stellar population models, predicting colours, spectra and chemical abundances. We compare our predictions with observed values of metallicity and colours for LSBs, and find excellent agreement with all observables. In particular, integrated colours, colour gradients, surface brightness and metallicity match very well to the observed values of LSBs for models with ages larger than 7 Gyr and high values ({$\lambda$} \&gt; 0.05) for the spin parameter of the haloes. We also compute the global star formation rate (SFR) in the Universe due to LSBs, and show that it has a flatter evolution with redshift than the corresponding SFR for normal discs. We furthermore compare the evolution in redshift of [Zn/H] for our models to those observed in damped Lyman {$\alpha$} systems by Pettini et al. and show that damped Lyman {$\alpha$} system abundances are consistent with the predicted abundances at different radii for LSBs. Finally, we show how the required late redshift of collapse of the halo may constrain the power spectrum of fluctuations.},

Using a statistically robust likelihood function, we fit one-zone models of galactic chemical evolution with exponential infall histories to both systems, deriving e-folding time-scales of {$\tau$}in = 1.01 {\textpm} 0.13 Gyr for GSE and \${\textbackslash}tau \_{\textbackslash}text\{in\} = 3.08{\textasciicircum}\{+3.19\}\_\{-1.16\}\$ Gyr for Wukong/LMS-1. GSE formed stars for \${\textbackslash}tau \_{\textbackslash}text\{tot\} = 5.40{\textasciicircum}\{+0.32\}\_\{-0.31\}\$ Gyr, sustaining star formation for {\textasciitilde}1.5-2 Gyr after its first infall into the Milky Way {\textasciitilde}10 Gyr ago. Our fit suggests that star formation lasted for \${\textbackslash}tau \_{\textbackslash}text\{tot\} = 3.36{\textasciicircum}\{+0.55\}\_\{-0.47\}\$ Gyr in Wukong/LMS-1, though our sample does not contain any age measurements. The differences in evolutionary parameters between the two are qualitatively consistent with trends with stellar mass M{$\star$} predicted by simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. Our inferred values of the outflow mass-loading factor reasonably match \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}propto M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textasciicircum}\{-1/3\}\$ as predicted by galactic wind models. Our fitting method is based only on Poisson sampling from an evolutionary track and requires no binning of the data. We demonstrate its accuracy by testing against mock data, showing that it accurately recovers the input model across a broad range of sample sizes (20 {$\leq$} N {$\leq$} 2000) and measurement uncertainties (0.01 {$\leq$} {$\sigma$}[{$\alpha$}/Fe], {$\sigma$}[Fe/H] {$\leq$} 0.5; \$0.02 {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}log \_\{10\}({\textbackslash}text\{age\})\} {\textbackslash}le 1\$). Due to the generic nature of our derivation, this likelihood function should be applicable to one-zone models of any parametrization and easily extensible to other astrophysical models which predict tracks in some observed space.},

  abstract = {Metallicities of both gas and stars decline toward large radii in spiral galaxies, a trend known as the radial metallicity gradient. We quantify the evolution of the metallicity gradient in the Milky Way as traced by APOGEE red giants with age estimates from machine learning algorithms. Stars up to ages of \${\textbackslash}sim\$9 Gyr follow a similar relation between metallicity and Galactocentric radius. This constancy challenges current models of Galactic chemical evolution, which typically predict lower metallicities for older stellar populations. Our results favor an equilibrium scenario, in which the gas-phase gradient reaches a nearly constant normalization early in the disk lifetime. Using a fiducial choice of parameters, we demonstrate that one possible origin of this behavior is an outflow that more readily ejects gas from the interstellar medium with increasing Galactocentric radius. A direct effect of the outflow is that baryons do not remain in the interstellar medium for long, which causes the ratio of star formation to accretion, \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\_{\textbackslash}star / {\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{in\}\$, to quickly become constant. This ratio is closely related to the local equilibrium metallicity, since its numerator and denominator set the rates of metal production by stars and hydrogen gained through accretion, respectively. Building in a merger event results in a perturbation that evolves back toward the equilibrium state on \${\textbackslash}sim\$Gyr timescales. Under the equilibrium scenario, the radial metallicity gradient is not a consequence of the inside-out growth of the disk but instead reflects a trend of declining \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\_{\textbackslash}star / {\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{in\}\$ with increasing Galactocentric radius.},

We estimate the strength of the required metallicity dependence by combining the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass with the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for galaxies and common parametrizations for the SN Ia delay-time distribution. The differences in SFHs can account for only {\textasciitilde}30 per cent of the increase in the specific SN Ia rate between stellar masses of M{$\star$} = 1010 and 107.2 M{$\odot$}. We find that an additional metallicity dependence of approximately {\textasciitilde}Z-0.5 is required to explain the observed scaling. This scaling matches the metallicity dependence of the close binary fraction observed in APOGEE, suggesting that the enhanced SN Ia rate in low-mass galaxies can be explained by a combination of their more extended SFHs and a higher binary fraction due to their lower metallicities. Due to the shape of the MZR, only galaxies below M{$\star$} {$\approx$} 3 {\texttimes} 109 M{$\odot$} are significantly affected by the metallicity-dependent SN Ia rates. The \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}text\{N\}\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{Ia\} / {\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star {\textasciicircum}\{-0.3\}\$ scaling becomes shallower with increasing redshift, dropping by factor of {\textasciitilde}2 at 107.2 M{$\odot$} between z = 0 and 1 with our {\textasciitilde}Z-0.5 scaling. With metallicity-independent rates, this decrease is a factor of {\textasciitilde}3. We discuss the implications of metallicity-dependent SN Ia rates for one-zone models of galactic chemical evolution.},

We find that existing observations are not sufficient to allow us to place precise limits on either the orbit or the initial state of the dwarf. Debris from the ongoing tidal stripping of the Sagittarius galaxy are expected to form moving groups in the halo of the Galaxy, and the discovery of such stars would strongly constrain the history and dynamical state of the dwarf Furthermore, if Sgr is presently being disrupted, we predict that its remains will be detectable as a moving group in the halo for more than 1 Gyr.

  abstract = {Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

  abstract = {The abundance of carbon relative to oxygen (C/O) is a promising probe of star formation history in the early universe, as the ratio changes with time due to production of these elements by different nucleosynthesis pathways. We present a measurement of (stat) {\textpm}0.15 (sys) in a z = 6.23 galaxy observed as part of the GLASS--JWST Early Release Science Program. Notably, we achieve good precision thanks to the detection of the rest-frame ultraviolet O iii], C iii], and C iv emission lines delivered by JWST/NIRSpec. The C/O abundance is {$\sim$}0.8 dex lower than the solar value and is consistent with the expected yield from core-collapse supernovae, indicating that longer-lived intermediate-mass stars have not fully contributed to carbon enrichment. This in turn implies rapid buildup of a young stellar population with age {$\lessequivlnt$}100 Myr in a galaxy seen {$\sim$}900 Myr after the big bang. Our chemical abundance analysis is consistent with spectral energy distribution modeling of JWST/NIRCam photometric data, which indicates a current stellar mass and specific star formation rate {$\simeq$}20 Gyr-1. These results showcase the value of chemical abundances and C/O in particular to study the earliest stages of galaxy assembly.},

Recent evidence seems to contradict this picture. In particular, since the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, it has been clear that planetary nebulae display a wide range of striking morphologies that cannot be understood in a single-star scenario, instead pointing towards binary evolution in a majority of systems. Here, we summarize our current understanding of the importance of binarity in the formation and shaping of planetary nebulae, as well as the surprises that recent observational studies have revealed with respect to our understanding of binary evolution in general. These advances have critical implications for the understanding of mass transfer processes in binary stars---particularly the all-important but ever-so-poorly understood 'common envelope phase'---as well as the formation of cosmologically important type Ia supernovae.},

DR13, released in 2016 August, contained APOGEE data for roughly 150,000 stars, and DR14, released in 2017 August, added about 110,000 more. Stellar parameters and abundances have been derived with an automated pipeline, the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (ASPCAP). We evaluate the performance of this pipeline by comparing the derived stellar parameters and abundances to those inferred from optical spectra and analysis for several hundred stars. For most elements---C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Cr, Mn, Ni---the DR14 ASPCAP analyses have systematic differences with the comparisons samples of less than 0.05 dex (median), and random differences of less than 0.15 dex (standard deviation). These differences are a combination of the uncertainties in both the comparison samples as well as the ASPCAP analysis. Compared to the references, magnesium is the most accurate alpha-element derived by ASPCAP, and shows a very clear thin/thick disk separation, while nickel is the most accurate iron-peak element (besides iron itself).},

We use imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) to measure the shapes of dwarf galaxies out to four effective radii for a sample of 6758 dwarfs at 0.005 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.2 and 107.0 {$<$} M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 109.6. We find that dwarfs are slightly triaxial, with (where the ellipsoid is characterized by three principal semiaxes constrained by C {$\leq$} B {$\leq$} A). At M{$\star$} {$>$} 108.5 M{$\odot$}, the galaxies grow from thick disk-like at one effective radius toward the spheroidal extreme at four effective radii. We also see that although blue dwarfs are, on average, characterized by thinner disks than red dwarfs, both blue and red dwarfs grow more spheroidal as a function of radius. This relation also holds true for a comparison between field and satellite dwarfs. This uniform trend toward relatively spheroidal shapes as a function of radius is consistent with an in situ formation mechanism for stellar outskirts around low-mass galaxies, in agreement with proposed models where star formation feedback produces round stellar outskirts around dwarfs.},

  abstract = {We present proper motions for the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) based on three epochs of Hubble Space Telescope data, spanning a {\textasciitilde}7 yr baseline, and centered on fields with background QSOs. The first two epochs, the subject of past analyses, were obtained with ACS/HRC, and have been reanalyzed here. The new third epoch with WFC3/UVIS increases the time baseline and provides better control of systematics. The three-epoch data yield proper-motion random errors of only 1\%-2\% per field. For the LMC this is sufficient to constrain the internal proper-motion dynamics, as will be discussed in a separate paper. Here we focus on the implied center-of-mass proper motions: {$\mu$} W, LMC = -1.910 {\textpm} 0.020 mas yr-1, {$\mu$} N, LMC = 0.229 {\textpm} 0.047 mas yr-1, and {$\mu$} W, SMC = -0.772 {\textpm} 0.063 mas yr-1, {$\mu$} N, SMC = -1.117 {\textpm} 0.061 mas yr-1. We combine the results with a revised understanding of the solar motion in the Milky Way to derive Galactocentric velocities: v tot, LMC = 321 {\textpm} 24 km s-1 and v tot, SMC = 217 {\textpm} 26 km s-1. Our proper-motion uncertainties are now dominated by limitations in our understanding of the internal kinematics and geometry of the Clouds, and our velocity uncertainties are dominated by distance errors. Orbit calculations for the Clouds around the Milky Way allow a range of orbital periods, depending on the uncertain masses of the Milky Way and LMC. Periods {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 4 Gyr are ruled out, which poses a challenge for traditional Magellanic Stream models. First-infall orbits are preferred (as supported by other arguments as well) if one imposes the requirement that the LMC and SMC must have been a bound pair for at least several Gyr.},

Our simulation campaign is based on a hybrid approach combining cosmological simulations and controlled numerical experiments. We select merger events from a Constrained Local Universe simulation of the Local Group (LG) and record the properties of the interacting dwarf-sized halos. This information is subsequently used to seed controlled experiments of binary encounters between dwarf galaxies consisting of exponential stellar disks embedded in cosmologically motivated dark matter halos. These simulations are designed to reproduce eight cosmological merger events, with initial masses of the interacting systems in the range {\textasciitilde}(5-60) {\texttimes} 107 M sun, occurring quite early in the history of the LG, more than 10 Gyr ago. We compute the properties of the merger remnants as a distant observer would and demonstrate that at least three of the simulated encounters produce systems with kinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in the LG. Tracing the history of the remnants in the cosmological simulation to z = 0, we find that two dSph-like objects remain isolated at distances {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 800 kpc from either the Milky Way or M31. These systems constitute plausible counterparts of the remote dSphs Cetus and Tucana which reside in the LG outskirts, far from the tidal influence of the primary galaxies. We conclude that merging of rotationally supported dwarfs represents a viable mechanism for the formation of dSphs in the LG and similar environments.},

The DM halo models are constructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to corelike profiles and the structural properties of the galaxy models are motivated by the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm of structure formation. The adopted force resolution allows robust density profile estimates in the inner {\textasciitilde}1\% of the virial radii of the simulated systems. We demonstrate that the central slopes and overall shapes of the remnant density profiles are virtually identical to those of the initial systems, suggesting that the remnants retain a remarkable memory of the density structure of their progenitors, despite the relaxation that accompanies merger activity. We also find that halo concentrations remain approximately constant through hierarchical merging involving identical systems and show that remnants contain significant fractions of their bound mass well beyond their formal virial radii. These conclusions hold for a wide variety of initial asymptotic density slopes, orbital energies, and encounter configurations, including sequences of consecutive merger events, simultaneous mergers of several systems, and mergers of halos with embedded cold baryonic components in the form of disks, spheroids, or both. As an immediate consequence, the net effect of gas cooling, which contracts and steepens the inner density profiles of DM halos, should be preserved through a period of dissipationless major merging. Our results imply that the characteristic universal shape of DM density profiles may be set early in the evolution of halos.},

  abstract = {The Moon is traditionally thought to have coalesced from the debris ejected by a giant impact onto the early Earth. However, such models struggle to explain the similar isotopic compositions of Earth and lunar rocks at the same time as the system's angular momentum, and the details of potential impact scenarios are hotly debated. Above a high resolution threshold for simulations, we find that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside the Earth's Roche limit. Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped then torqued onto wider, stable orbits. Furthermore, the outer layers of these directly formed satellites are molten over cooler interiors and are composed of around 60\% proto-Earth material. This could alleviate the tension between the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition and the different signature expected for the impactor. Immediate formation opens up new options for the Moon's early orbit and evolution, including the possibility of a highly tilted orbit to explain the lunar inclination, and offers a simpler, single-stage scenario for the origin of the Moon.},

  abstract = {By using chemo-dynamical simulations of the Milky Way-type galaxies formation, we find that the two {$\alpha$}-sequences are formed in quite different physical environments. The high-{$\alpha$} sequence is formed early from a burst of star formation in a turbulent, compact gaseous disc that forms a thick disc. The low-{$\alpha$} stellar population is the result of quiescent star formation supported by the slow accretion of enriched gas on to a radially extended thin disc. Feedback-driven outflows during the formation of the thick disc are responsible for the enrichment of the surrounding gaseous halo, which subsequently feeds the disc on a longer time-scale. During the thin disc phase, chemical evolution reaches an equilibrium metallicity and abundance, where the stars pile-up. This equilibrium metallicity decreases towards the outer disc, generating the ridge line that forms the low-{$\alpha$} sequence. We identify a second mechanism capable of creating a low-{$\alpha$} sequence in one of our simulations. A rapid shutdown of the star formation due to feedback at the end of the thick disc phase, suppresses the chemical enrichment of the halo gas, which, once accreted on to the star-forming disc, dilutes the interstellar medium at the beginning of the thin disc formation. Therefore, the bimodality is independent of any particular merger history, suggesting that it could be much more widespread than has been claimed. We also find that radial migration has a negligible effect on the \${\textbackslash}rm [{\textbackslash}alpha / Fe]{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}![Fe / H]\$ distribution over time, suggesting that {$\alpha$}-bimodality results purely from the presence of different star formation regimes over the galaxy's formation.},

  abstract = {The stellar-mass--halo-mass (SMHM) relation is central to our understanding of galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. However, its normalisation, slope, and scatter are highly uncertain at dwarf galaxy scales. In this paper, we present DarkLight, a new semi-empirical dwarf galaxy formation model designed to robustly predict the SMHM relation for the smallest galaxies. DarkLight harnesses a correlation between the mean star formation rate of dwarfs and their peak rotation speed -- the \${\textbackslash}langle\$SFR\${\textbackslash}rangle\$-\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ relation -- that we derive from simulations and observations. Given the sparsity of data for isolated dwarfs with \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 20\$ km/s, we fit the \${\textbackslash}langle\$SFR\${\textbackslash}rangle\$-\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ relation to observational data for dwarfs above this velocity scale and to the high-resolution EDGE cosmological simulations below. Reionisation quenching is implemented via distinct \${\textbackslash}langle\$SFR\${\textbackslash}rangle\$-\$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ relations before and after reionisation. We find that the SMHM scatter is small at reionisation, \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.2 dex, but rises to \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.5 dex (\$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$) at a halo mass of \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\${\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ as star formation is quenched by reionisation but dark matter halo masses continue to grow. While we do not find a significant break in the slope of the SMHM relation, one can be introduced if reionisation occurs early (\$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm quench\} rsim 5\$). Finally, we find that dwarfs can be star forming today down to a halo mass of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 \${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We predict that the lowest mass star forming dwarf irregulars in the nearby universe are the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of quiescent isolated dwarfs.},

  abstract = {New observations make it possible to re-examine the question of the density distribution in globular clusters. Jeans' law is based on insufficient observations and on an incorrect theory. On Palomar Schmidt plates the densities can be followed far enough out to define a limit to a globular cluster. The observed loca- tion of this limit agrees with the limit to be expected as a result of galactic tidal forces. The central regions of all globular clusters are similar, except for the effect of the tidal cutoff. An empirical formula has been found that represents the density from center to edge in globular clusters of all degrees of central concen- tration. The formula has three parameters, which is the minimum number permitted by the physical circum- stances. Globular clusters are therefore as similar in structure as they could possibly be. Galactic clusters and Sculptor-type dwarf galaxies also appear to follow the same density law. From dynamical considerations it would appear that all these stellar systems are subject to two types of relaxation, which produce nearly identical effects. The first relaxation is produced by the initial mixing of the system. Thereupon stellar encounters slowly change the density parameters without affecting the basic law. Relative to globular clusters, giant elliptical galaxies have an excess of brightness near the center. This difference can be explained as a result of relaxation, equipartition, and an excess of dwarf stars.},

The models are spatially limited, corresponding to the tidal cutoff imposed by the Milky Way. Their projected density distributions are similar to those observed in open clusters, globular clusters, and elliptical galaxies. Within each model the fractional escape rate is uniform throughout. The escape rate from a cluster depends on the number of stars and the strength of the tidal force field; when expressed in this way it is almost independent of core radius or central concentration.

This is the largest sample of individual {$\alpha$} element (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) abundance measurements in any single dSph. The measurements are made from Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrometer medium-resolution spectra (6400-9000 {\AA}, R {\textasciitilde} 6500). Based on comparisons to published high-resolution (R gsim 20,000) spectroscopic measurements, our measurements have uncertainties of {$\sigma$}[Fe/H] = 0.14 and {$\sigma$}[{$\alpha$}/Fe] = 0.13. The Sculptor [Fe/H] distribution has a mean lang[Fe/H]rang = -1.58 and is asymmetric with a long, metal-poor tail, indicative of a history of extended star formation. Sculptor has a larger fraction of stars with [Fe/H] {$<$} -2 than the MW halo. We have discovered one star with [Fe/H] = -3.80 {\textpm} 0.28, which is the most metal-poor star known anywhere except the MW halo, but high-resolution spectroscopy is needed to measure this star's detailed abundances. As has been previously reported based on high-resolution spectroscopy, [{$\alpha$}/Fe] in Sculptor falls as [Fe/H] increases. The metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.5) have lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe] than Galactic halo field stars of comparable metallicity. This indicates that star formation proceeded more gradually in Sculptor than in the Galactic halo. We also observe radial abundance gradients of -0.030 {\textpm} 0.003 dex arcmin-1 in [Fe/H] and +0.013 {\textpm} 0.003 dex arcmin-1 in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] out to 11 arcmin (275 pc). Together, these measurements cast Sculptor and possibly other surviving dSphs as representative of the dwarf galaxies from which the metal-poor tail of the Galactic halo formed.},

The uniformity of the relation is in contradiction to previous estimates of metallicity based on photometry. This relationship is roughly continuous with the stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation for galaxies as massive as M * = 1012 M {$\odot$}. Although the average metallicities of dwarf galaxies depend only on stellar mass, the shapes of their metallicity distributions depend on galaxy type. The metallicity distributions of dIrrs resemble simple, leaky box chemical evolution models, whereas dSphs require an additional parameter, such as gas accretion, to explain the shapes of their metallicity distributions. Furthermore, the metallicity distributions of the more luminous dSphs have sharp, metal-rich cut-offs that are consistent with the sudden truncation of star formation due to ram pressure stripping. The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

  abstract = {The theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, coupled with an estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance (D/H)pr, offers insights into the baryon density of the Universe. Independently, the baryon density can be constrained during a different cosmological era through the analysis of cosmic microwave background anisotropy. The comparison of these estimates serves as a rigorous test for the self-consistency of the standard cosmological model and stands as a potent tool in the quest for new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. For a meaningful comparison, a clear understanding of the various systematic errors affecting deuterium measurements is crucial. Given the limited number of D/H measurements, each new estimate carries significant weight. This study presents the detection of D I absorption lines in a metal-poor sub-Damped Lyman-{$\alpha$} system (\${\textbackslash}rm [O/H]=-1.71{\textbackslash}pm 0.02\$, log N(H I) = 19.304 {\textpm} 0.004) at zabs = 3.42 towards the quasar SDSS J133254.51+005250.6. Through simultaneous fitting of H I and D I Lyman-series lines, as well as low-ionization metal lines, observed at high spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise using VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES, we derive log (D I/H I) = -4.622 {\textpm} 0.014, accounting for statistical and systematic uncertainties of 0.008dex and 0.012 dex, respectively. Thanks to negligible ionization corrections and minimal deuterium astration at low metallicity, this D/H ratio provides a robust measurement of the primordial deuterium abundance, consistent and competitive with previous works. Incorporating all prior measurements, the best estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance is constrained as: (D/H)pr = (2.533 {\textpm} 0.024) {\texttimes} 10-5. This represents a 5 per cent improvement in precision over previous studies and reveals a moderate tension with the expectation from the standard model ({$\approx$}2.2{$\sigma$}). This discrepancy underscores the importance of further measurements in the pursuit of new physics.},

Separation of dwarf stars from foreground stars by color allows a robust estimation of the structural parameters of UMi. We examine earlier evidence of two lumps in the UMi stellar distribution. We detect a statistically significant asymmetry in the stellar distribution of UMi along the major axis. Structure in the stellar distribution of UMi might indicate a tidal origin for UMi's high observed mass-to-light ratio. We demonstrate a technique for obtaining the absolute magnitude of UMi from horizontal-branch star counts compared with M92; this method of luminosity estimation is independent of the distance to UMi. We obtain M\_V=-8.87+/-sigmaM\_V, where sigmaM\_V=0.14 if M92 is a perfect calibrator and sigmaM\_V{$<$}{\textasciitilde}0.35 is an upper bound on the error arising from differences in stellar populations. Our value for M\_V is consistent with earlier measurements and has a smaller uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The nearby Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal (UMi dSph) is one of the most dark matter-dominated galaxies known, with a central mass-to-light ratio M/L{\textasciitilde}70. Somewhat anomalously, it appears to contain morphological substructure in the form of a second peak in the stellar number density. It is often argued that this substructure must be transient, because it could not survive for the {\textasciitilde}12 Gyr age of the system, given the crossing time implied by UMi's 8.8 km s-1 internal velocity dispersion. In this Letter, however, we present evidence that the substructure has a cold kinematical signature and argue that UMi's clumpiness could indeed be a primordial artefact. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that substructure is incompatible with the cusped dark matter halos predicted by the prevailing cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm but is consistent with an unbound stellar cluster sloshing back and forth within the nearly harmonic potential of a cored dark matter halo. Thus, CDM appears to disagree with observation at the least massive, most dark matter-dominated end of the galaxy mass spectrum.},

  abstract = {We study the origin and properties of the population of unbound stars in the kinematic samples of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. For this purpose we have run a high-resolution N-body simulation of a two-component dwarf galaxy orbiting in a Milky Way potential. In agreement with the tidal stirring scenario of Mayer et al., the dwarf is placed on a highly eccentric orbit, its initial stellar component is in the form of an exponential disc and it has a NFW-like dark matter (DM) halo. After 10 Gyr of evolution the dwarf produces a spheroidal stellar component and is strongly tidally stripped so that mass follows light and the stars are on almost isotropic orbits. From this final state, we create mock kinematic data sets for 200 stars by observing the dwarf in different directions. We find that when the dwarf is observed along the tidal tails the kinematic samples are strongly contaminated by unbound stars from the tails. We also study another source of possible contamination by adding stars from the Milky Way. We demonstrate that most of the unbound stars can be removed by the method of interloper rejection proposed by den Hartog \& Katgert and recently tested on simulated DM haloes. We model the cleaned-up kinematic samples using solutions of the Jeans equation with constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and velocity anisotropy parameter. We show that even for such a strongly stripped dwarf the Jeans analysis, when applied to cleaned samples, allows us to reproduce the mass and M/L of the dwarf with accuracy typically better than 25 per cent and almost exactly in the case when the line of sight is perpendicular to the tidal tails. The analysis was applied to the new data for the Fornax dSph galaxy. We show that after careful removal of interlopers the velocity dispersion profile of Fornax can be reproduced by a model in which mass traces light with a M/L of 11 solar units and isotropic orbits. We demonstrate that most of the contamination in the kinematic sample of Fornax probably originates from the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {We conduct high-resolution collisionless N-body simulations to investigate the tidal evolution of dwarf galaxies on an eccentric orbit in the Milky Way (MW) potential. The dwarfs originally consist of a low surface brightness stellar disc embedded in a cosmologically motivated dark matter halo. During 10 Gyr of dynamical evolution and after five pericentre passages, the dwarfs suffer substantial mass loss and their stellar component undergoes a major morphological transformation from a disc to a bar and finally to a spheroid. The bar is preserved for most of the time as the angular momentum is transferred outside the galaxy. A dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy is formed via gradual shortening of the bar. This work thus provides a comprehensive quantitative explanation of a potentially crucial morphological transformation mechanism for dwarf galaxies that operates in groups as well as in clusters. We compare three cases with different initial inclinations of the disc and find that the evolution is fastest when the disc is coplanar with the orbit. Despite the strong tidal perturbations and mass loss, the dwarfs remain dark matter dominated. For most of the time, the one-dimensional stellar velocity dispersion, {$\sigma$}, follows the maximum circular velocity, Vmax, and they are both good tracers of the bound mass. Specifically, we find that Mbound {\textasciitilde} V3.5max and in agreement with earlier studies based on pure dark matter simulations. The latter relation is based on directly measuring the stellar kinematics of the simulated dwarf, and may thus be reliably used to map the observed stellar velocity dispersions of dSphs to halo circular velocities when addressing the missing satellites problem.},

We employ this group as a numerical laboratory for studying the evolution of the population of its subhaloes from the point of view of the effects it may have on the origin of different types of dwarf galaxies. We focus on the processes of tidal stripping of the satellites, their interaction, merging and grouping before infall. The tidal stripping manifests itself in the transition between the phase of mass accretion and mass loss seen in most subhaloes, which occurs at the moment of infall on to the host halo, and the change of the shape of their mass function with redshift. Although the satellites often form groups, they are loosely bound within them and do not interact with each other. The infall of a large group could however explain the observed peculiar distribution of the LG satellites, but only if it occurred recently. Mergers between prospective subhaloes are significant only during an early stage of evolution, i.e. more than 7 Gyr ago, when they are still outside the host haloes. Such events could thus contribute to the formation of more distant early-type Milky Way companions. Once the subhaloes enter the host halo the mergers become very rare.},

  abstract = {Predicting structural properties of dark matter haloes is one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the suite of MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. We find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter haloes and to make 1-2 per cent accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. For massive haloes, the average density profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter {$\alpha$} in the Einasto approximation. We show that haloes progress through three stages of evolution. They start as rare density peaks and experience fast and nearly radial infall that brings mass closer to the centre, producing a highly concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the {$\alpha$} parameter with a nearly constant core radius. Later haloes slide into the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. At this stage, the concentration does not depend on halo mass. Once the rate of accretion and merging slows down, haloes move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. Accurate analytical fits are provided.},

A general form for the mass density {$\rho$}(r) is used, making it possible to represent most of the popular density profiles found in the literature, including the cuspy density profiles found in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We demonstrate explicitly that our models are in equilibrium. In contrast, many existing N-body realizations of isolated systems have been constructed under the assumption that the local velocity distribution is Maxwellian. We show that a Maxwellian halo with an initial {$\rho$}(r){\textasciitilde}r-1 central density cusp immediately develops a constant-density core. Moreover, after just one crossing time the orbital anisotropy has changed over the entire system, and the initially isotropic model becomes radially anisotropic. These effects have important implications for many studies, including the survival of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Comparing the evolution and mass-loss rate of isotropic Maxwellian and self-consistent Navarro, Frenk, \& White (NFW), satellites orbiting inside a static host CDM potential, we find that the former are unrealistically susceptible to tidal disruption. Thus, recent studies of the mass-loss rate and disruption timescales of substructure in CDM models may be compromised by using the Maxwellian approximation. We also demonstrate that a radially anisotropic, self-consistent NFW satellite loses mass at a rate several times higher than that of its isotropic counterpart on the same external tidal field and orbit.},

The catalogue contains radial velocity and stellar parameter measurements for \${\textbackslash}simeq\$ 400 000 unique stars observed during commissioning and survey validation by DESI. These observations were made under conditions similar to the Milky Way Survey (MWS) currently carried out by DESI but also include multiple specially targeted fields, such as those containing well-studied dwarf galaxies and stellar streams. The majority of observed stars have \$16 r 20\$ with a median signal-to-noise ratio in the spectra of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 20. In the paper, we describe the structure of the catalogue, give an overview of different target classes observed, as well as provide recipes for selecting clean stellar samples. We validate the catalogue using external high-resolution measurements and show that radial velocities, surface gravities, and iron abundances determined by DESI are accurate to 1 km s-1, 0.3 dex, and \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 0.15 dex respectively. We also demonstrate possible uses of the catalogue for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way stellar halo and Draco dwarf spheroidal. The value-added catalogue described in this paper is the very first DESI MWS catalogue. The next DESI data release, expected in less than a year, will add the data from the first year of DESI survey operations and will contain approximately 4 million stars, along with significant processing improvements.},

Within the red giant branch population, we find evidence for the presence of three distinct stellar subpopulations with different metallicities, spatial distributions, kinematics and ages. As in the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf spheroidals, the subpopulation with the lowest average metallicity is more extended and kinematically hotter than all other populations. However, we identify an inversion in the parallel ordering of metallicity, kinematics and characteristic length-scale in the two most metal-rich subpopulations, which therefore do not contribute to a global negative chemical gradient. Contrary to common trends in the chemical properties with radius, the metal richest population is more extended and mildly kinematically hotter than the main component of intermediate metallicity. More investigations are required to ascertain the nature of this inversion, but we comment on the mechanisms that might have caused it.},

  abstract = {Many colour maps provided by vendors have highly uneven perceptual contrast over their range. It is not uncommon for colour maps to have perceptual flat spots that can hide a feature as large as one tenth of the total data range. Colour maps may also have perceptual discontinuities that induce the appearance of false features. Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt relief shading are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the construction of ternary images are presented. Unlike the RGB primaries these basis colours produce images whereby the salience of structures are consistent irrespective of the assignment of basis colours to data channels.},

  abstract = {Using collisionless N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, we construct realistic models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group. The dwarfs are initially composed of stellar discs embedded in dark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on an eccentric orbit typical for Milky Way subhaloes. After a few Gyr of evolution, the stellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidal forces. Observing the simulated dwarfs along the three principal axes of the stellar component, we create mock data sets and determine the corresponding half-light radii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. Using the estimator proposed by Wolf et al., we calculate the masses within half-light radii. The masses obtained in this way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of 2 when the line of sight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. We then divide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population and trace their evolution in time. The two populations, although strongly affected by tidal forces, retain different density profiles even after a few Gyr of evolution. We measure the half-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populations along different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the mass distribution in the dwarf galaxies following the method recently proposed by Walker \& Pe{\~n}arrubia. The inferred slopes are systematically over- or underestimated, depending on the line of sight. In particular, when the dwarf is seen along the longest axis of the stellar component, a significantly shallower density profile is inferred than the real one measured from the simulations. Given that most dSph galaxies in the Local Group are non-spherical in appearance and their orientation with respect to our line of sight is unknown, but most probably random, the method can be reliably applied only to a large sample of dwarfs when these systematic errors are expected to be diminished.},

We combine Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry, USNO-B astrometry, and SDSS and Calar Alto spectroscopy to construct a complete, empirical six-dimensional (6D) phase-space map of the stream. We find that an eccentric orbit in a flattened isothermal potential describes this phase-space map well. Even after marginalizing over the stream orbital parameters and the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center, the orbital fit to GD-1 places strong constraints on the circular velocity at the Sun's radius Vc = 224 {\textpm} 13 km s-1 and total potential flattening q {$\Phi$} = 0.87+0.07 -0.04. When we drop any informative priors on Vc , the GD-1 constraint becomes Vc = 221 {\textpm} 18 km s-1. Our 6D map of GD-1, therefore, yields the best current constraint on Vc and the only strong constraint on q {$\Phi$} at Galactocentric radii near R {\textasciitilde} 15 kpc. Much, if not all, of the total potential flattening may be attributed to the mass in the stellar disk, so the GD-1 constraints on the flattening of the halo itself are weak: q {$\Phi$},halo {$>$} 0.89 at 90\% confidence. The greatest uncertainty in the 6D map and the orbital analysis stems from the photometric distances, which will be obviated by GAIA.

The model satellites are disrupted after several perigalactic passages, but orbiting condensations in phase space can clearly be identified as remnants well after this event. An intrinsic ( M/L) true {$<$} 3 leads to long-lived model remnants that show, as seen from Earth, a tantalizingly close resemblance to observed dSph satellites with ( M/L) obs {$>$} 10 . The reason for large ( M/L) obs is that the remnants have non-isotropic velocity dispersions, are non-spherical and are not in dynamical equilibrium. The remnants fade with time (i.e. orbital phase) and ( M/L) obs increases indicating a correlation between brightness and ( M/L) obs as in the observed dSph sample. The observed correlation between central surface brightness and integrated absolute magnitude is also approximately reproduced by model remnants of different dynamical age. A possibly useful method for probing the line-of-sight extension of a dSph galaxy is suggested. If it is true that most if not all dSph satellites are tidally modified remnants without dark matter then it is plausible that their progenitors may have formed as satellite galaxies in tidal tails during possible early merging events.},

  abstract = {Using the example of the tidal stream of the Milky Way globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5), we demonstrate how observational data on tidal streams can be efficiently reduced in dimensionality and modeled in a Bayesian framework. Our approach combines detection of stream overdensities by a Difference-of-Gaussians process with fast streakline models of globular cluster streams and a continuous likelihood function built from these models. Inference is performed with Markov chain Monte Carlo. By generating {$\approx$} \{\{10\}7\} model streams, we show that the unique geometry of the Pal 5 debris yields powerful constraints on the solar position and motion, the Milky Way and Pal 5 itself. All 10 model parameters were allowed to vary over large ranges without additional prior information. Using only readily available SDSS data and a few radial velocities from the literature, we find that the distance of the Sun from the Galactic Center is 8.30 {\textpm} 0.25 kpc, and the transverse velocity is 253 {\textpm} 16 km s-1. Both estimates are in excellent agreement with independent measurements of these two quantities. Assuming a standard disk and bulge model, we determine the Galactic mass within Pal 5's apogalactic radius of 19 kpc to be (2.1+/- 0.4){\texttimes} \{\{10\}11\} \{\{M\}{$\odot$} \}. Moreover, we find the potential of the dark halo with a flattening of \{\{q\}z\}=0.95-0.12+0.16 to be essentially spherical---at least within the radial range that is effectively probed by Pal 5. We also determine Pal 5's mass, distance, and proper motion independently from other methods, which enables us to perform vital cross-checks. Our inferred heliocentric distance of Pal 5 is 23.6-0.7+0.8 kpc, in perfect agreement with, and more precise than, estimates from isochrone fitting of deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. We conclude that finding and modeling more globular cluster streams is an efficient way to map out the structure of our Galaxy to high precision. With more observational data and by using additional prior information, the precision of this mapping can be significantly increased.},

  abstract = {Draco and Ursa Minor both have published velocity dispersions of {\textasciitilde}10 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} implying large amounts of dark matter. Previous assumptions that the dark matter distribution followed the light led to central densities 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than in other dwarf galaxies. I construct models where the stellar distribution function is isothermal and use star counts to constrain the mass distribution. Even with these different assumptions, the dark matter densities are high. For a constant density halo, the best fit values are {$\rho$} {\textasciitilde}0.2 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum} and the lower limits are D {$\rho>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}. Draco is poorly fitted with a uniform density halo, but good fits are obtained using a dark matter distribution with a core radius. In this model, the apparent cut-off radius has nothing to do with galactic tides. For comparison, King's empirical formula was refitted. The derived tidal radii, r\_t\_, are only lower limits, r\_t.D\_ {$>$} 25 arcmin and r\_t.UM\_ {$>$} 35 arcmin. If the dark matter follows the light, then {$\rho\_$}0.D\_ {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.4 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum} and {$\rho\_$}0.UM\_ {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.2 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}.

In all the models, the central column density of dark matter is as large as that of bright galaxies, i.e. 100-300M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-2{\textasciicircum}. Since the central surface brightnesses are low, Ursa Minor and Draco are excellent targets for dark matter searches.},

It has become evident that massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity, binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. Although the problem to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model these diverse paths of massive stars toward their violent end stage. I show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also allows sketching the post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars, for which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues. Recent supernova discoveries owing to the current boost in transient searches allow tentative mappings of progenitor models with supernova types, including pair-instability supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.},

  abstract = {The majority of massive stars live in binary or multiple systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M{$\odot$}) that have been stripped due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies, at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses. It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications of our findings for the "explodability", supernova observations, and nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can be readily used as input for detailed supernova simulations.},

  abstract = {P-splines are an attractive approach for modeling nonlinear smooth effects of covariates within the additive and varying coefficient models framework. In this article, we first develop a Bayesian version for P-splines and generalize in a second step the approach in various ways. First, the assumption of constant smoothing parameters can be replaced by allowing the smoothing parameters to be locally adaptive. This is particularly useful in situations with changing curvature of the underlying smooth function or with highly oscillating functions. In a second extension, one-dimensional P-splines are generalized to two-dimensional surface fitting for modeling interactions between metrical covariates. In a last step, the approach is extended to situations with spatially correlated responses allowing the estimation of geoadditive models. Inference is fully Bayesian and uses recent MCMC techniques for drawing random samples from the posterior. In a couple of simulation studies the performance of Bayesian P-splines is studied and compared to other approaches in the literature. We illustrate the approach by two complex application on rents for flats in Munich and on human brain mapping.},

  abstract = {Gaia measures the five astrometric parameters for stars in the Milky Way, but only four of them (positions and proper motion, but not distance) are well measured beyond a few kpc from the Sun. Modern spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE cover a large area of the Milky Way disc and we can use the relation between spectra and luminosity to determine distances to stars beyond Gaia's parallax reach. Here, we design a deep neural network trained on stars in common between Gaia and APOGEE that determines spectro-photometric distances to APOGEE stars, while including a flexible model to calibrate parallax zero-point biases in Gaia DR2. We determine the zero-point offset to be -52.3 {\textpm} 2.0 {$\mu$} as when modelling it as a global constant, but also train a multivariate zero-point offset model that depends on G, GBP - GRP colour, and Teff and that can be applied to all {$\approx$}58 million stars in Gaia DR2 within APOGEE's colour-magnitude range and within APOGEE's sky footprint. Our spectro-photometric distances are more precise than Gaia at distances \{{$\greaterequivlnt$}\} 2 kpc from the Sun. We release a catalogue of spectro-photometric distances for the entire APOGEE DR14 data set which covers Galactocentric radii 2 kpc {$\lessequivlnt$} R {$\lessequivlnt$} 19 kpc; \{{$\approx$}\} 150 000 stars have {$<$} 10 per cent uncertainty, making this a powerful sample to study the chemo-dynamical structure of the disc. We use this sample to map the mean [Fe/H] and 15 abundance ratios [X/Fe] from the Galactic Centre to the edge of the disc. Among many interesting trends, we find that the bulge and bar region at R {$\lessequivlnt$} 5 kpc clearly stands out in [Fe/H] and most abundance ratios.},

  abstract = {Observing the first generation of stars, Population III (Pop III), is still a challenge even with the JWST due to their faintness. Instead, searching for fossil records of Pop III stars in nearby dwarf galaxies provides an alternative method for studying their physical properties. It is intriguing that a star recently discovered in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy, named AS0039, is considered to show the unique signature of a Pop III star. The detailed abundance patterns of AS0039 are well matched with those predicted by nucleosynthesis models for Pop III exploding as an energetic hypernova (HN), confirming its potential to provide insight into the properties of the first stars. This study aims to explore the environmental conditions required for the formation of such a unique star using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations on dwarf galaxies with a mass of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}8\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ at z = 0 while varying the fraction of Pop III stars that undergo HNe. Our simulations identify rapid gas inflow (\${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}{\textbackslash}sim 0.08\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) as a possible factor in facilitating the formation of stars similar to AS0039. Alternatively, the delayed formation of subsequent Population II (Pop II) stars in the gas-enriched environment may lead to low-metallicity stars like AS0039. Additionally, using the A-SLOTH code, we investigate the probability of finding remnants of Pop II stars with HN signatures in nearby dwarf satellite galaxies. We suggest that the most likely dwarf galaxies to contain HN signatures are massive satellites with a probability of 40 per cent in the range of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ to\} {\textbackslash} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}7 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ to\} {\textbackslash} 10{\textasciicircum}8\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, considering observational limitations.},

We compare the HST spectra with lower resolution International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra of the same galaxies and find systematic differences: the bright star clusters targeted in HST's {\textasciitilde}1'' apertures provide about 15\% of the starburst luminosity traced by IUE's 10'' {\texttimes} 20'' aperture; they are bluer and have stronger stellar-wind features suggesting that the HST apertures have preferentially been placed on the youngest areas of the burst. In contrast, lines arising from the interstellar medium (ISM) show similar equivalent widths in both the large and small aperture observations, suggesting similar ISM properties from larger to smaller scales. In order to quantify the UV spectral morphology of star-forming galaxies, we created a set of UV line indices similar to the standard optical Lick indices. We discuss the relation between the UV spectral morphology and the properties of the galaxy host. We present our atlas of FOS and GHRS spectra both in print and online. The data set is useful as a baseline for comparisons with observations of the rest-frame UV spectra of star-forming galaxies at high redshift.},

We consider 60 low-mass galaxies with high-quality H I and/or stellar rotation curves (including starbursting dwarfs, irregulars, and spheroidals), and estimate d\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$}\emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}(0) as \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$}, where \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} is the galaxy scale length. For gas-rich dwarfs, we find that \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} correlates with the central surface brightness \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$}, the mean atomic gas surface density {$\Sigma$}\textsubscript{gas{$<$}sub/{$>$}, and the star formation rate surface density {$\Sigma$}\textsubscript{SFR{$<$}sub/{$>$}. Starbursting galaxies, such as blue compact dwarfs (BCDs), generally have higher values of \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} than dwarf irregulars, suggesting that the starburst is closely related to the inner shape of the potential well. There are, however, some ``compact'' irregulars with values of \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} similar to BCDs. Unless a redistribution of mass takes place, BCDs must evolve into compact irregulars. Rotating spheroidals in the Virgo cluster follow the same correlation between \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$><$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{d{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} as gas-rich dwarfs.

Finally, we find that, as for spiral galaxies and massive starbursts, the star-formation activity in dwarfs can be parametrized as {$\Sigma$}\textsubscript{SFR{$<$}sub/{$>$} = \emph{{$\epsilon<$}i/{$>$} {$\Sigma$}\textsubscript{gas{$<$}sub/{$>$}/\emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{orb{$<$}sub/{$>$}, where \emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{orb{$<$}sub/{$>$} is the orbital time and \emph{{$\epsilon<$}i/{$>$} {$\simeq$} 0.02.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

We also carried out a detailed comparison of the effects of recent developments in abundance analysis (e.g., spherical models vs. plane-parallel) and the automation that is required to efficiently deal with such large data sets. We present abundances of {$\alpha$}-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), iron-peak elements (Fe, Ni, and Cr), and heavy elements (Y, Ba, La, Nd, and Eu). Our sample was randomly selected and is clearly dominated by the younger and more metal-rich component of Fornax, which represents the major fraction of stars in the central region. This means that the majority of our stars are 1-4 Gyr old, and thus represent the end phase of chemical evolution in this system. Our sample of stars has unusually low [ {$\alpha$}/Fe] , [Ni/Fe], and [Na/Fe] compared to the Milky Way stellar populations at the same [Fe/H]. The particularly important role of stellar winds from low-metallicity AGB stars in the creation of s-process elements is clearly seen from the high [Ba/Y]. Furthermore, we present evidence of an s-process origin of Eu.

Based on the continuity in velocity, we confirm that the Tucana III tails are real tidal extensions of Tucana III. The large velocity gradient of the stream implies that Tucana III is likely on a radial orbit. We successfully obtain metallicities for four members in the core and 12 members in the tails. We find that members close to the ends of the stream tend to be more metal-poor than members in the core, indicating a possible metallicity gradient between the center of the progenitor halo and its edge. The spread in metallicity suggests that the progenitor of the Tucana III stream is likely a dwarf galaxy rather than a star cluster. Furthermore, we find that with the precise photometry of the Dark Energy Survey data, there is a discernible color offset between metal-rich disk stars and metal-poor stream members. This metallicity-dependent color offers a more efficient method to recognize metal-poor targets and will increase the selection efficiency of stream members for future spectroscopic follow-up programs on stellar streams.},

  abstract = {We introduce the southern stellar stream spectroscopy survey (S5), an on-going program to map the kinematics and chemistry of stellar streams in the southern hemisphere. The initial focus of S5 has been spectroscopic observations of recently identified streams within the footprint of the dark energy survey (DES), with the eventual goal of surveying streams across the entire southern sky. Stellar streams are composed of material that has been tidally striped from dwarf galaxies and globular clusters and hence are excellent dynamical probes of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, as well as providing a detailed snapshot of its accretion history. Observing with the 3.9\,m Anglo-Australian Telescope's 2-degree-Field fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph, and combining the precise photometry of DES DR1 with the superb proper motions from Gaia DR2, allows us to conduct an efficient spectroscopic survey to map these stellar streams. So far S5 has mapped nine DES streams and three streams outside of DES; the former are the first spectroscopic observations of these recently discovered streams. In addition to the stream survey, we use spare fibres to undertake a Milky Way halo survey and a low-redshift galaxy survey. This paper presents an overview of the S5 program, describing the scientific motivation for the survey, target selection, observation strategy, data reduction, and survey validation. Finally, we describe early science results on stellar streams and Milky Way halo stars drawn from the survey. Updates on S5, including future public data releases, can be found at http://s5collab.github.io.},

  abstract = {Most heavy elements beyond the iron peak are synthesized via neutron capture processes. The nature of the astrophysical sites of neutron capture processes is still very unclear. In this work, we explore the observational constraints of the chemical abundances of s-process and r-process elements on the sites of neutron-capture processes by applying Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models to the data from Gaia-ESO large spectroscopic stellar survey. For the r-process, the [Eu/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution suggests a short delay time of the site that produces Eu. Other independent observations (e.g. NS-NS binaries), however, suggest a significant fraction of long delayed ({$>$}1 Gyr) neutron star mergers (NSM). When assuming NSM as the only r-process sites, these two observational constraints are inconsistent at above 1{$\sigma$} level. Including short delayed r-process sites like magnetorotational supernova can resolve this inconsistency. For the s-process, we find a weak metallicity dependence of the [Ba/Y] ratio, which traces the s-process efficiency. Our GCE model with up-to-date yields of AGB stars qualitatively reproduces this metallicity dependence, but the model predicts a much higher [Ba/Y] ratio compared to the data. This mismatch suggests that the s-process efficiency of low-mass AGB stars in the current AGB nucleosynthesis models could be overestimated.},

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) contains results for 1.812 billion sources in the magnitude range G = 3-21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, the models, and the processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia EDR3, as well as the validation of these results performed within the astrometry task. Methods: The processing broadly followed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements to the modelling of observations. For the first time in the Gaia data processing, colour-dependent calibrations of the line- and point-spread functions have been used for sources with well-determined colours from DR2. In the astrometric processing these sources obtained five-parameter solutions, whereas other sources were processed using a special calibration that allowed a pseudocolour to be estimated as the sixth astrometric parameter. Compared with DR2, the astrometric calibration models have been extended, and the spin-related distortion model includes a self-consistent determination of basic-angle variations, improving the global parallax zero point. Results: Gaia EDR3 gives full astrometric data (positions at epoch J2016.0, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1.468 billion sources (585 millionwith five-parameter solutions, 882 million with six parameters), and mean positions at J2016.0 for an additional 344 million.Solutions with five parameters are generally more accurate than six-parameter solutions, and are available for 93\% of the sources brighter than the 17th magnitude. The median uncertainty in parallax and annual proper motion is 0.02-0.03 mas at magnitude G = 9-14, and around 0.5 mas at G = 20. Extensive characterisation of the statistical properties of the solutions is provided, including the estimated angular power spectrum of parallax bias from the quasars.},

  abstract = {We use the APOSTLE simulation suite to study the formation of galactic disks, in order to better understand the origin of their vertical structure. We select a disk-dominated Milky Way analogue galaxy from the simulation which experiences a minimum of external interaction with its environment as a generalizable test case. The simulated stellar disk is found to form upside-down from a gradually thinning, flared gaseous disk, where the rate of thinning is regulated by feedback from in-situ star formation. No significant sources of vertical heating are present in the disk, allowing the vertical structure of newly-formed stellar populations to be preserved over time. As a result, the properties of the stellar disk as a function of age accurately trace the properties of the gaseous disk as a function of time. This allows us to derive a physical model, in which the disk is isothermal, in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, and vertically supported by bulk motions rather than thermal pressure, which relates the present-day vertical age-velocity dispersion relation (AVR) at a given radius to the local star formation history as a simple power-law relation, with a best fit power law index \$n=1.82\$. This relation is then applied to the observed AVRs in the Milky Way from the recent literature, providing a predicted local star formation history for the Milky Way as a function of radius. We then compare this predicted history to others from the literature, in order to test whether our upside-down model from the simulation is consistent with the observed Galaxy. We also examine the observed ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersions for consistency with our model. While our predicted history is broadly consistent with other predictions, the range of possible histories in the literature makes a more definitive conclusion difficult.},

We propose an evolutionary model for the origin of And II involving a merger between two discy dwarf galaxies with different disc scalelengths. The dwarfs are placed on a radial orbit towards each other with their angular momenta inclined by 90 deg. The merger remnant forms a stable triaxial galaxy with rotation only around the longest axis whose origin is naturally explained as due to the symmetry of the initial configuration and the conservation of angular momentum components along the direction of the merger. The stars originating from the two dwarfs show significantly different surface density profiles while having very similar kinematics as required by the data. We also study an alternative scenario for the formation of And II, via tidal stirring of a discy dwarf. While intrinsic rotation occurs naturally in this model as a remnant of the initial rotation of the disc, it is mostly around the shortest axis of the stellar component. We conclude that the velocity distribution in And II is much more naturally explained by a scenario involving a past merger.},

  abstract = {We model the large kinematic data sets for the four Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites: Carina, Fornax, Sculptor and Sextans, recently published by Walker et al. The member stars are selected using a reliable dynamical interloper removal scheme tested on simulated data. Our member selection is more restrictive than the one based on metallicity indicators as it removes not only contamination due to Milky Way stars but also the unbound stars from the tidal tails. We model the cleaned data sets by adjusting the solutions of the Jeans equations to the profiles of the projected velocity dispersion and kurtosis. The data are well reproduced by models where mass follows light and the best-fitting stellar orbits are isotropic to weakly tangential, as expected from the tidal stirring scenario. The Fornax dwarf, with more than 2400 member stars, is a dSph galaxy with the most accurately determined mass to date: its 1{$\sigma$} error following from the sampling errors of the velocity moments is below 5 per cent. With mass-to-light ratio of 97 solar units, Sextans seems to be the most dark matter dominated of the four dSph galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present echelle spectrophotometry of the blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 obtained with the VLT UVES. We have measured the intensities of a large number of permitted and forbidden emission lines in four zones of the central part of the galaxy. We detect faint C II and O II recombination lines, the first time that these are unambiguously detected in a dwarf starburst galaxy. The physical conditions of the ionized gas have been derived using a large number of different line intensity ratios. Chemical abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, Ar, and Fe have been determined following standard methods. C++ and O++ abundances have been derived from pure recombination lines and are larger than those obtained from collisionally excited lines (from 0.30 to 0.40 dex for C++ and from 0.19 to 0.28 dex for O++). This result is consistent with a temperature fluctuation parameter (t2) between 0.050 and 0.072. We confirm previous results that indicate the presence of a localized N enrichment in certain zones of NGC 5253 and detect a possible slight He overabundance in the same zones. The enrichment pattern agrees with that expected for the pollution by the ejecta of Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars. The amount of enriched material needed to produce the observed overabundance is consistent with the mass lost by the number of W-R stars estimated in the starbursts. We discuss the possible origin of the difference between abundances derived from recombination and collisionally excited lines (the so-called abundance discrepancy problem) in H II regions, finding that a recent hypothesis based on the delayed enrichment by SN ejecta inclusions seems not to explain the observed features.

  abstract = {The well-established correlations between the mass of massive black holes (BHs) in the nuclei of most studied galaxies and various global properties of their hosting galaxy lend support to the idea that dwarf galaxies and globular clusters could also host a BH in their centers. Direct kinematic detection of BHs in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies is seriously hindered by the small number of stars inside the gravitational influence region of the BH. The aim of this Letter is to establish an upper dynamical limit on the mass of the putative BH in the Ursa Minor (UMi) dSph galaxy. We present direct N-body simulations of the tidal disruption of the dynamical fossil observed in UMi, with and without a massive BH. We find that the observed substructure is incompatible with the presence of a massive BH of (2-3) {\texttimes} 104 M sun within the core of UMi. These limits are consistent with the extrapolation of the M BH-{$\sigma$} relation to the M BH {$<$} 106 M sun regime. We also show that the BH may be off-center with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy.},

The V-I colors of the dE globular clusters, nuclei, and underlying field-star populations are used to trace the dE star formation histories. We find that the dE globular cluster candidates are as blue as the metal-poor globular clusters of the Milky Way. The observed correlation of the dE globular cluster systems' V-I color with the luminosity of the host dE is strong evidence that the globular clusters were formed within the halos of dEs and do not have a pregalactic origin. Assuming that the majority of dE clusters are old, the mean globular cluster color-host galaxy luminosity correlation implies a cluster metallicity-galaxy luminosity relation of GC{$>$}{\textasciitilde}L0.22+/-0.05B, which is significantly shallower than the field-star metallicity-host galaxy luminosity relationship observed in Local Group dwarfs (FS{$>$}{\textasciitilde}L0.4). The dE stellar envelopes are 0.1-0.2 mag redder in V-I than their globular clusters and nuclei. This color offset implies separate star formation episodes within the dEs for the clusters and field stars, while the very blue colors of two dE nuclei trace a third star formation event in those dEs less than 1 Gyr ago.},

  abstract = {Well-motivated elementary particle candidates for the dark matter, such as the sterile neutrino, behave as warm dark matter (WDM). For particle masses of the order of a keV, free streaming produces a cutoff in the linear fluctuation power spectrum at a scale corresponding to dwarf galaxies. We investigate the abundance and structure of WDM haloes and subhaloes on these scales using high resolution cosmological N-body simulations of galactic haloes of mass similar to the Milky Way's. On scales larger than the free-streaming cutoff, the initial conditions have the same power spectrum and phases as one of the cold dark matter (CDM) haloes previously simulated by Springel et al. as part of the Virgo consortium Aquarius project. We have simulated four haloes with WDM particle masses in the range 1.5-2.3 keV and, for one case, we have carried out further simulations at varying resolution. N-body simulations in which the power spectrum cutoff is resolved are known to undergo artificial fragmentation in filaments producing spurious clumps which, for small masses ({$<$}107 M{$\odot$} in our case) outnumber genuine haloes. We have developed a robust algorithm to identify these spurious objects and remove them from our halo catalogues. We find that the WDM subhalo mass function is suppressed by well over an order magnitude relative to the CDM case for masses {$<$}109 M{$\odot$}. Requiring that there should be at least as many subhaloes as there are observed satellites in the Milky Way leads to a conservative lower limit to the (thermal equivalent) WDM particle mass of {$\sim$} 1.5 keV. WDM haloes and subhaloes have cuspy density distributions that are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White or Einasto profiles. Their central densities are lower for lower WDM particle masses and none of the models we have considered suffering from the `too big to fail' problem recently highlighted by Boylan-Kolchin et al.},

  abstract = {The empirical model of Lu et~al. is updated with recent data of galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs). The model predicts that the slope of galaxy SMFs at z~\&gt;~2 should be quite steep at the low-mass end, beyond the current detection limit, and it is a strong prediction that can be tested against future observations. The model is used to investigate the galaxy star formation and assembly or merger histories in detail. Most of the stars in cluster centrals, corresponding to brightest cluster galaxies in observations, formed earlier than z~{$\approx~$}2 but have been assembled much later. Typically, they have experienced {$\approx$}5 major mergers since their star formation was quenched. Milky Way mass galaxies have had on-going star formation without significant mergers since z~{$\approx~$}2, and are thus free of significant (classic) bulges produced by major mergers. Dwarf galaxies in haloes with Mh~\&lt;~1011\,h-1\,M{$\odot$} or M{$\star~\&$}lt;~109\,M{$\odot$} have experienced a star formation burst at z~\&gt;~2, followed by a nearly constant star formation rate after z~=~1, and the stellar age decreases with stellar mass, contrary to the `downsizing' trend for more massive galaxies. Major mergers are not uncommon during the early burst phase and may result in the formation of old spheroids in dwarf galaxies. We also characterize the stellar population of halo stars in different haloes.},

  abstract = {We use a suite of cosmological simulations to study the mass--concentration--redshift relation, c(M, z), of dark matter haloes. Our simulations include standard {$\Lambda$}-cold dark matter (CDM) models, and additional runs with truncated power spectra, consistent with a thermal warm dark matter (WDM) scenario. We find that the mass profiles of CDM and WDM haloes are self-similar and well approximated by the Einasto profile. The c(M, z) relation of CDM haloes is monotonic: concentrations decrease with increasing virial mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift at fixed mass. The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM haloes are also scale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do not apply to WDM haloes: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the characteristic scale imposed by the power spectrum suppression. Further, the WDM c(M, z) relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass scale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower masses. We show that the assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer its concentration, provided that the total mass of its progenitors is considered (the `collapsed mass history'; CMH), rather than just that of its main ancestor. This exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to derive a simple scaling that reproduces the mass--concentration--redshift relation of both CDM and WDM haloes over a vast range of halo masses and redshifts. Our model therefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift, cosmology and power spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations.},

The finite element-smoothed particle hydrodynamics (FE-SPH) adaptive method combines the advantages of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and finite element method (FEM) in solving hypervelocity impact (HVI) problems. Employing FE-SPH adaptive method is a new idea for the analysis of planetary impact cratering which is different from impact-simplified arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (iSALE). In this paper, we establish a complete numerical model of planetary impact cratering through the FE-SPH method, including material failure criterion, thermodynamic analysis, gravity preloading, etc. We reproduce the numerical results by Collins et al. (2012) and highly consistent results are obtained through comparative analysis. This study simulates the formation process of simple and complex impact craters, and the temperature, pressure, density, and geometric shape of the impact zone can be quantitatively obtained. We further analyze the distribution of polymorphs and rock fragmentations in the impact zone based on the theories of shock metamorphism. The proposed analysis method may assist geologists in conducting geological studies.},

An exactly solvable accretion model in which the gas mass rises to a maximum and then declines gives the smaller spread observed. This model gives a rather prompt initial enrichment automatically.

Not only the Magellanic stream, but also Sculptor and the Draco-Ursa Minor stream are then seen to lie in a plane which is presumably the plane of the orbit of the Magellanic Clouds about the galactic centre. By demanding that all points of the Magellanic stream be precisely in the plane defined by the galactic centre Palomar 13 and the centre of the mass of the Magellanic Clouds, the distances to all points of the stream are calculated from parallax.

  abstract = {Recent observations have revealed the presence of strong C III] emission (EW \$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{C{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small III\}]\}\} 20\$ {\AA}) in z {$>$} 6 galaxies, the origin of which remains unclear. In an effort to understand the nature of these line emitters, we have initiated a survey targeting C III] emission in gravitationally lensed reionization-era analogues identified in Hubble Space Telescope imaging of clusters from the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey. Here, we report initial results on four galaxies selected to have low stellar masses (2-8 {\texttimes} 107 M{$\odot$}) and J125-band flux excesses indicative of intense [O III] + H {$\beta$} emission (EW \$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{[O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small III\}]+H{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}beta \}\}\$ = 500-2000 {\AA}), similar to what has been observed at z {$>$} 6. We detect C III] emission in three of the four sources, with the C III] EW reaching values seen in the reionization era (EW \$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{C{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small III\}]\}\}{\textbackslash}simeq 17{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!22\$ {\AA}) in the two sources with the strongest optical line emission (EW \$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{[O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small III\}]+H{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}beta \}\}{\textbackslash}simeq 2000\$ {\AA}). We have obtained a Magellan/FIRE (Folded-port InfraRed Echellette) near-infrared spectrum of the strongest C III] emitter in our sample, revealing gas that is both metal poor and highly ionized. Using photoionization models, we are able to simultaneously reproduce the intense C III] and optical line emission for extremely young (2-3 Myr) and metal-poor (0.06-0.08 Z{$\odot$}) stellar populations, as would be expected after a substantial upturn in the star formation rate of a low-mass galaxy. The sources in this survey are among the first for which C III] has been used as the primary means of redshift confirmation. We suggest that it should be possible to extend this approach to z {$>$} 6 with current facilities, using C III] to measure redshifts of objects with IRAC excesses indicating EW \$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{[O{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}small III\}]+H{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}beta \}\}{\textbackslash}simeq 2000\$ {\AA}, providing a method of spectroscopic confirmation independent of Ly {$\alpha$}.},

  abstract = {We have begun a survey of the structure of the Milky Way halo, as well as the halos of other Local Group galaxies, as traced by their constituent giant stars. These giant stars are identified via large-area, CCD photometric campaigns. Here we present the basis for our photometric search method, which relies on the gravity sensitivity of the Mg I triplet+MgH features near 5150 {\AA} in F-K stars, and which is sensed by the flux in the intermediate-band DDO51 filter. Our technique is a simplified variant of the combined Washington/DDO51 four-filter technique described by Geisler, which we modify for the specific purpose of efficiently identifying distant giant stars for follow-up spectroscopic study: We show here that for most stars the Washington T1-T2 color is correlated monotonically with the Washington M-T2 color with relatively low scatter; for the purposes of our survey, this correlation obviates the need to image in the T1 filter, as originally proposed by Geisler. To calibrate our (M-T2, M-DDO51) diagram as a means to discriminate field giant stars from nearby dwarfs, we utilize new photometry of the main sequences of the open clusters NGC 3680 and NGC 2477 and the red giant branches of the clusters NGC 3680, Melotte 66, and {$\omega$} Centauri, supplemented with data on field stars, globular clusters and open clusters by Doug Geisler and collaborators. By combining the data on stars from different clusters, and by taking advantage of the wide abundance spread within {$\omega$} Centauri, we verify the primary dependence of the M-DDO51 color on luminosity and demonstrate the secondary sensitivity to metallicity among giant stars. Our empirical results are found to be generally consistent with those from analysis of synthetic spectra by Paltoglou \& Bell. Finally, we provide conversion formulae from the (M, M-T2) system to the (V, V-I) system, corresponding reddening laws, as well as empirical red giant branch curves from {$\omega$} Centauri stars for use in deriving photometric parallaxes for giant stars of various metallicities (but equivalent ages) to those of {$\omega$} Centauri giants.},

The galaxy was resolved into stars with Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 including old red giant branch and red clump. We have constructed a model of the resolved stellar populations and measured the star formation rate and metallicity as a function of time. The main star formation activity period occurred about 12.6-13.7 Gyr ago. These stars are mostly metal poor, with a mean metallicity [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -1 to -1.6 dex. About 60 per cent of the total stellar mass was formed during this event. There are indications of intermediate-age star formation in KKR 25 between 1 and 4 Gyr with no significant signs of metal enrichment for these stars. Long-slit spectroscopy was carried out using the Russian 6-m telescope of the integrated starlight and bright individual objects in the galaxy. We have discovered a planetary nebula (PN) in KKR 25. This is the first known PN in a dSph galaxy outside the Local Group. We have measured its oxygen abundance 12 + log (O/H) = 7.60 {\textpm} 0.07 dex and a radial velocity Vh = -79 km s-1. We have analysed the stellar density distribution in the galaxy body. The galaxy has an exponential surface brightness profile with a central light depression. We discuss the evolutionary status of KKR 25, which belongs to a rare class of very isolated dwarf galaxies with spheroidal morphology.},

We show that luminosity and distance distributions of the model satellites are consistent with the distributions measured in the DES, PS1, and SDSS surveys, even without including a model for the orphan galaxies. We also show that our model for dwarf galaxy sizes can simultaneously reproduce the observed distribution of stellar half-mass radii, r1/2, of the MW satellites and the overall r1/2-M{$\star$} relation exhibited by observed dwarf galaxies. The model predicts that some of the observed faint stellar systems with r1/2 {$<$} 10 pc are ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Scaling of the stellar mass M{$\star$} and peak halo mass Mpeak for the model satellites is not described by a power law, but has a clear flattening of M{$\star$}-Mpeak scaling at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\} 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ imprinted by reionization. As a result, the fraction of low mass haloes (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\} 10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) hosting galaxies with MV {$<$} 0 is predicted to be 50 per cent at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}{\textbackslash}sim 3.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$. We find that such high fraction at that halo mass helps to reproduce the number of dwarf galaxies discovered recently in the HSC-SSP survey. Using the model we forecast that there should be the total of \$440{\textasciicircum}\{+201\}\_\{-147\}\$ (68 per cent confidence interval) MW satellites with MV {$<$} 0 and r1/2 {$>$} 10 pc within 300 kpc and make specific predictions for the HSC-SSP, DELVE-WIDE, and LSST surveys.},

  abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important distance indicators, element factories, cosmic-ray accelerators, kinetic-energy sources in galaxy evolution, and end points of stellar binary evolution. It has long been clear that a SN Ia must be the runaway thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate carbon-oxygen stellar core, most likely a white dwarf (WD). However, the specific progenitor systems of SNe Ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not been identified. Two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long been considered: single-degenerate (SD), in which a WD gains mass from a nondegenerate star; and double-degenerate (DD), involving the merger of two WDs. New theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with some interesting updates and variants. We review the significant recent observational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. We consider clues that have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposed progenitor populations, from studies of SN Ia sites---pre- and postexplosion---from analysis of the explosions themselves and from the measurement of event rates. The recent nearby and well-studied event, SN 2011fe, has been particularly revealing. The observational results are not yet conclusive and sometimes prone to competing theoretical interpretations. Nevertheless, it appears that DD progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could be behind some, if not all, SNe Ia. We point to some directions that may lead to future progress.},

We show that this correlation can be entirely reproduced by fitting empirical relations in the central surface brightness versus absolute magnitude and S{\'e}rsic index versus absolute magnitude parameter spaces, and by assuming the existence of two types of outer halo GCs: one of high surface brightness (HSB group), with properties similar to those of inner halo clusters; and another of low surface brightness (LSB group), which share characteristics with dwarf spheroidal and UFD galaxies. Given the similarities of LSB clusters with dwarf spheroidal and UFD galaxies, we discuss the possibility that outer halo clusters also originated inside dark matter halos and that tidal forces from different host galaxy potentials are responsible for the different properties between HSB and LSB clusters.},

Combined with the set of homogeneous distances published in an earlier contribution, our analysis dutifully tracks all relevant sources of uncertainty in the determination of the properties of the dwarf galaxies from the PAndAS photometric catalog. We further publish the posterior probability distribution functions of all the parameters we fit for in the form of MCMC chains available online; these inputs should be used in any analysis that aims to remain truthful to the data and properly account for covariance between parameters.},

  abstract = {We derive the structural parameters of the recently discovered very low luminosity Milky Way satellites through a maximum likelihood algorithm applied to SDSS data. For each satellite, even when only a few tens of stars are available down to the SDSS flux limit, the algorithm yields robust estimates and errors for the centroid, position angle, ellipticity, exponential half-light radius and number of member stars (within the SDSS). This latter parameter is then used in conjunction with stellar population models of the satellites to derive their absolute magnitudes and stellar masses, accounting for color-magnitude diagram shot noise. Most parameters are in good agreement with previous determinations, but we now properly account for parameter covariances. However, we find that faint satellites are somewhat more elliptical than initially thought, and ascribe this effect to the previous use of smoothed maps, which can be dominated by the smoothing (round) kernel. As a result, the faintest half of the Milky Way dwarf galaxies (MV gtrsim -7.5) is significantly (4 {$\sigma$}) flatter (langepsilonrang = 0.47 +/- 0.03) than its brightest half (MVlesssim - 7.5, langepsilonrang = 0.32 +/- 0.02). From our best models, we also investigate whether the seemingly distorted shape of the satellites, often taken to be a sign of tidal distortion, can be quantified. We find that, except for tentative evidence of distortion in Canes Venatici I and Ursa Major II, these can be completely accounted for by Poisson scatter in the sparsely sampled systems. We consider three scenarios that could explain the rather elongated shape of faint satellites: rotation supported systems, stars following the shape of more triaxial dark matter subhalos, or elongation due to tidal interaction with the Milky Way. Although none of these is entirely satisfactory, the last one appears the least problematic, but obviously warrants much deeper observations to track evidence of such tidal interaction.},

  abstract = {We report the detection of main-sequence and blue horizontal-branch stars of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy beyond its tidal radius, indicating the existence of a possible tidal extension in this satellite of the Milky Way. This tidal extension could spread out well beyond the area covered in our survey (R{$>$}80'), as suggested by the presence of a ``break'' to a shallower slope observed in its density profile. The V-band surface brightness for this possible tidal extension ranges from 29.8 to 31.5 mag arcsec-2. The area covered in our survey ({\textasciitilde}1.65 deg2) is not enough to discriminate if this extratidal population is part of a tidal tail or an extended halo around the galaxy. The existence of this tidal extension in Ursa Minor indicates that this satellite is currently undergoing a tidal disruption process by the Milky Way. We discuss the possibility of a tidal origin for the high mass-to-light ratio observed in this galaxy on the basis of our result and recent theoretical simulations of the tidal disruption of dwarf satellites in the Galactic halo.},

We combine proper motions (PMs) from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and line-of-sight velocities (vlos) from the literature to derive their 3D internal kinematics and to study the presence of internal velocity gradients. We find velocity gradients along the line-of-sight for Carina, Draco, Fornax, and Ursa Minor, at {$\geq$}1{$\sigma$} level of significance. The value of such gradients appears to be related to the orbital history of the dwarfs, indicating that the interaction with the MW is causing them. Dwarfs that are close to the MW and moving towards their orbits pericentres show, on average, larger velocity gradients. On the other hand, dwarfs that have recently left their orbits pericentres show no significant gradients. Lastly, dwarfs located at large Galactocentric distances show gradients with an intermediate intensity. Our results would indicate that the torque caused by the strong tidal forces exerted by the MW induces a strong velocity gradient when the dwarfs approach their orbits pericentres. During the pericentre passage, the rapid change in the forces direction would disrupt such gradient, which may steadily recover as the galaxies recede. We assess our findings by analysing dwarfs satellites from the TNG50 simulation. We find a significant increase in the intensity of the detected gradients as the satellites approach their pericentre, followed by a sharp drop as they abandon it, supporting our results for the dSphs of the MW.},

The RRLs display a spread in V-magnitude ({$\sim$}0.35 mag) which appears larger than photometric errors and the horizontal branch (HB) luminosity evolution of a mono-metallic population. Using several calibrations of two different reddening free and metal independent period-Wesenheit relations we provide a new distance estimate {$\mu$} = 19.62 mag ({$\sigma\mu$} = 0.04 mag) that agrees well with literature estimates. We constrained the metallicity distribution of the old population, using the MI period-luminosity relation, and we found that it ranges from -2.3 to -1.5 dex. The current estimate is narrower than suggested by low and intermediate spectroscopy of RGBs ({$\Delta$} [Fe/H]{$\leq$} 1.5). We also investigated the HB morphology as a function of the galactocentric distance. The HB in the innermost regions is dominated by red HB stars and by RRLs, consistent with a more metal-rich population, while in the outermost regions it is dominated by blue HB stars and RRLs typical of a metal-poor population. Our results suggest that fast chemical evolution occurred in Sculptor, and that the radial gradients were in place at an early epoch.},

After expelling the leftover gas, the stellar system undergoes a dynamical relaxation inside the dark matter halo. These models can adequately describe the observed properties of three (Draco, Sculptor, and Carina) out of four Galactic dwarf spheroidal satellites studied in this paper. We suggest that the fourth galaxy (Fornax), which cannot be fitted well with our model, is observed all the way to its tidal radius. Our best-fitting models have virial masses of {\textasciitilde}109 Msolar, halo formation redshifts consistent with the age of oldest stars in these dwarfs, and shallow inner dark matter density profiles (with slope {$\gamma$}{\textasciitilde}-0.5,...,0). The inferred temperature of gas is {\textasciitilde}104 K. In our model, the ``extratidal'' stars observed in the vicinity of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies are gravitationally bound to the galaxies and are a part of the extended stellar halos. The inferred virial masses make Galactic dwarf spheroidals massive enough to alleviate the ``missing satellites'' problem of {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmologies.},

Even for the dwarf galaxy Sculptor---one of the best-studied systems, which is inferred to be strongly dark matter dominated3,4---there are conflicting reports5-7 on its mean motion around the Milky Way, and the three-dimensional internal motions of its stars have never been measured. Here, we present precise proper motions of Sculptor's stars based on data from the Gaia mission8 and Hubble Space Telescope. Our measurements show that Sculptor moves around the Milky Way on a high-inclination elongated orbit that takes it much further out than previously thought. For Sculptor's internal velocity dispersions, we find {$\sigma$}R = 11.5 {\textpm} 4.3 km s-1 and {$\sigma$}T = 8.5 {\textpm} 3.2 km s-1 along the projected radial and tangential directions. Thus, the stars in our sample move preferentially on radial orbits as quantified by the anisotropy parameter, which we find to be {$\beta$} 0.8 6-0.83+0.12 at a location beyond the core radius. Taken at face value, this high radial anisotropy requires abandoning conventional models9 for Sculptor's mass distribution. Our sample is dominated by metal-rich stars and for these we find {$\beta$}M R 0.9 5-0.27+0.04---a value consistent with multi-component spherical models where Sculptor is embedded in a cuspy dark halo10, as might be expected for cold dark matter.},

We present the sample selection, the observations, and the data reduction. Systemic redshifts are measured from rest-frame optical lines for 33/35 sources. In the stacked spectrum, our LAEs are characterized by an interstellar medium with little dust, a low metallicity, and a high ionization state. The ionizing sources are young hot stars that power strong emission lines in the optical and high-ionization lines in the ultraviolet (UV). The LAEs exhibit clumpy UV morphologies and have outflowing kinematics with blueshifted Si II absorption, a broad [O III] component, and a red-skewed Ly {$\alpha$} line. Typically, 30 per cent of the Ly {$\alpha$} photons escape, of which one quarter on the blue side of the systemic velocity. A fraction of Ly {$\alpha$} photons escape directly at the systemic suggesting clear channels enabling an {$\approx$}10 per cent escape of ionizing photons, consistent with an inference based on Mg II. A combination of a low effective H I column density, a low dust content, and young starburst determines whether a star-forming galaxy is observed as an LAE. The first is possibly related to outflows and/or a fortunate viewing angle, while we find that the latter two in LAEs are typical for their stellar mass of 109 M{$\odot$}.},

We demonstrate that the stars and star clusters that form naturally in the inner regions of dwarfs are expected to migrate from the gas-rich, star-forming center to join the stellar spheroid. For dwarf galaxies, this process could be the dominant source of halo stars. The effect is caused by stellar-feedback-driven bulk motions of dense gas which, by causing potential fluctuations in the inner regions of the halo, couple to all collisionless components. This effect has been demonstrated to generate cores in otherwise cuspy cold dark matter profiles and is particularly effective in dwarf galaxy halos. It can build a stellar spheroid with larger ages and lower metallicities at greater radii without requiring an outside-in formation model. Globular-cluster-type star clusters can be created in the galactic ISM and then migrate to the spheroid on 100 Myr timescales. Once outside the inner regions, they are less susceptible to tidal disruption and are thus long lived; clusters on wider orbits may be easily unbound from the dwarf to join the halo of a larger galaxy during a merger. A simulated dwarf galaxy (Mvir {$\simeq$} 109 M{$\Sun$} at z = 5) is used to examine this gravitational coupling to dark matter and stars.},

  abstract = {We present results from high-resolution N-body/SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamic) simulations of rotationally supported dwarf irregular galaxies moving on bound orbits in the massive dark matter halo of the Milky Way. The dwarf models span a range in disk surface density and the masses and sizes of their dark halos are consistent with the predictions of cold dark matter cosmogonies. We show that the strong tidal field of the Milky Way determines severe mass loss in their halos and disks and induces bar and bending instabilities that transform low surface brightness dwarfs (LSBs) into dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and high surface brightness dwarfs (HSBs) into dwarf ellipticals (dEs) in less than 10 Gyr. The final central velocity dispersions of the remnants are in the range 8-30 km s-1 and their final v/{$\sigma$} falls to values less than 0.5, matching well the kinematics of early-type dwarfs. The transformation requires the orbital time of the dwarf to be {$<$}{\textasciitilde}3-4 Gyr, which implies a halo as massive and extended as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation to explain the origin of even the farthest dSph satellites of the Milky Way, Leo I, and Leo II. We show that only dwarfs with central dark matter densities as high as those of Draco and Ursa Minor can survive for 10 Gyr in the proximity of the Milky Way. A correlation between the central density and the distance of the dwarfs from the primary galaxy is indeed expected in hierarchical models, in which the densest objects should have small orbital times because of their early formation epochs. Part of the gas is stripped and part is funneled to the center because of the bar, generating one strong burst of star formation in HSBs and smaller, multiple bursts in LSBs. Therefore, the large variety of star formation histories observed in Local Group dSphs arises because different types of dIrr progenitors respond differently to the external perturbation of the Milky Way. Our evolutionary model naturally explains the morphology-density relation observed in the Local Group and in other nearby loose groups. Extended low surface brightness stellar and gaseous streams originate from LSBs and follow the orbit of the dwarfs for several gigayears. Because of their high velocities, unbound stars projected along the line of sight can lead to overestimating the mass-to-light ratio of the bound remnant by a factor {$<$}{\textasciitilde}2, but this does not eliminate the need of extremely high dark matter contents in some of the dSphs.},

Repeated tidal shocks at the pericenters of their orbits partially strip their halos and disks and trigger dynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar components. After only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness dIrr's are transformed into dSp'hs while high surface brightness dIrr's evolve into dE's. This evolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relation observed for LG dwarfs. Dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, such as the dIrr GR8, are turned into Draco or Ursa Minor, the faintest and most dark matter dominated among LG dSph's. If disks include a gaseous component, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts of star formation. The resulting star formation histories are in good qualitative agreement with those derived using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) color-magnitude diagrams for local dSph's.},

  abstract = {Recent observations suggest that Carina and other nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are surrounded by unbound stars tidally stripped by the Milky Way. We have run high-resolution N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within the Milky Way halo to determine if such observations can be explained with dark matter potentials like those implied by current structure formation models. We show that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or with cuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter c{$<$}{\textasciitilde} 7) lead to flat outer stellar density profiles like that of Carina for a variety of orbital configurations. On the contrary, it is more difficult to remove stars from cuspy dark matter haloes with concentrations as high as predicted by cold dark matter (CDM) models at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies (c {$>$} 10), and the data can only be reproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. Our simulations show that Carina is losing mass at a fractional rate {$<$}0.1 Gyr-1 and its mass-to-light ratio could be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected along the line of sight. We follow the evolution of the tidal debris within a triaxial clumpy cold dark matter Milky Way halo which causes differential precession and small-scale heating of the stellar streams. This renders them useless as a dynamical tracer of the Galactic potential in CDM cosmogonies. Models with warm dark matter (WDM) or collisional fluid dark matter (FDM) produce dwarf haloes with lower central densities than CDM and would be consistent with the observed tidal tails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current data on nearby dwarf spheroidals. Galactic haloes in models with FDM are expected to be smooth and spherical and would be favoured by the detection of cold coherent streams such as that associated with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal. In this respect the distribution of stellar streams on the plane of the sky can provide a novel test of the nature of the dark matter. On the other end, the streams could be similarly dispersed in lumpy CDM haloes and in smoother, triaxial WDM haloes.},

  abstract = {The projected structures and integrated properties of the Andromeda I, II, III, V, VI, VII and Cetus dwarf spheroidal galaxies are analysed based upon resolved counts of red giant branch stars. The observations were taken as part of the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Survey of M31 and its environs. For each object, we have derived isopleth maps, surface brightness profiles, intensity-weighted centres, position angles, ellipticities, tidal radii, core radii, concentration parameters, exponential scalelengths, Plummer scalelengths, half-light radii, absolute magnitudes and central surface brightnesses. Our analysis probes into larger radius and fainter surface brightnesses than most previous studies, and as a result we find that the galaxies are generally larger and brighter than has previously been recognized. In particular, the luminosity of Andromeda V is found to be consistent with the higher metallicity value which has been derived for it. We find that exponential and Plummer profiles provide adequate fits to the surface brightness profiles, although the more general King models provide the best formal fits. Andromeda I shows strong evidence of tidal disruption and S-shaped tidal tails are clearly visible. On the other hand, Cetus does not show any evidence of tidal truncation, let alone disruption, which is perhaps unsurprising given its isolated location. Andromeda II shows compelling evidence of a large excess of stars at small radius and suggests that this galaxy consists of a secondary core component, in analogy with recent results for Sculptor and Sextans. Comparing the M31 dwarf spheroidal population with the Galactic population, we find that the scaleradii of the M31 population are larger than those for the Galactic population by at least a factor of 2, for all absolute magnitudes. This difference is either due to environmental factors or due to orbital properties, suggesting that the ensemble average tidal field experienced by the M31 dwarf spheroidals is weaker than that experienced by the Galactic dwarf spheroidals. We find that the two populations are offset from one another in the central surface brightness - luminosity relation, which is probably related to this difference in their scale sizes. Finally, we find that the M31 dwarf spheroidals show the same correlation with distance from host as shown by the Galactic population, such that dwarf spheroidals with a higher central surface brightness are found further from their host. This again suggests that environment plays a significant role in dwarf galaxy evolution, and requires detailed modelling to explain the origin of this result.},

  abstract = {The dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Local Group have long been thought to be simple spheroids of stars embedded within extended dark matter haloes. Recently, however, evidence for the presence of spatially and kinematically distinct stellar populations has been accumulating. Here, we examine the influence of such components on dynamical models of dwarf galaxies embedded in cold dark matter haloes. We begin by constructing a model of Andromeda II, a dSph satellite of M31 which shows evidence for spatially distinct stellar components. We find that the two-component model predicts an overall velocity dispersion profile that remains approximately constant at {\textasciitilde}10-11kms-1 out to {\textasciitilde}1 kpc from the centre; this is despite wide kinematic and spatial differences between the two individual components. This prediction can be validated by detailed spectroscopic analysis of this galaxy. The presence of two components may also help to explain oddities in the velocity dispersion profiles of other dSphs; we show that velocity dispersion profiles which appear to rise from the centre outwards before levelling off - such as those of Leo I, Draco, and Fornax - can result from the gradual transition from a dynamically cold, concentrated component to a second, hotter, and more spatially extended one, both in equilibrium within the same dark halo. Dwarf galaxies with two stellar components generally have a leptokurtic line-of-sight velocity distribution which is well described by a double Maxwellian. This may be contrasted with other dynamical explanations such as a radially dependent anisotropy in the stars' orbits. Interestingly, we find that multiple equilibrium components could also provide a potential alternative origin for `extra-tidal' stars (normally ascribed to tidal effects) in situations where corroborating evidence for tides - such as elongation of the main body of the dwarf in the orbital direction or velocity gradients across its face driven by protruding tidal tails - may be lacking.},

Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates reliably placing them within 3 Mpc of the Sun are identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible "floor" in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered.},

  abstract = {The impact of metallicity on the mass-loss rate from red giant branch (RGB) stars is studied through its effect on the parameters of horizontal branch (HB) stars. The scaling factors from Reimers and Schr{\"o}der and Cuntz are used to measure the efficiency of RGB mass-loss for typical stars in 56 well-studied Galactic globular clusters (GCs). The median values among clusters are, respectively, \${\textbackslash}eta \_\{{\textbackslash}rm R\} = 0.477 {\textbackslash}pm 0.070 {\textasciicircum}\{+0.050\}\_\{-0.062\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}eta \_\{{\textbackslash}rm SC\} = 0.172 {\textbackslash}pm 0.024 {\textasciicircum}\{+0.018\}\_\{-0.023\}\$ (standard deviation and systematic uncertainties, respectively). Over a factor of 200 in iron abundance, {$\eta$} varies by {$\lessequivlnt$}30~per cent, thus mass-loss mechanisms on the RGB have very little metallicity dependence. Any remaining dependence is within the current systematic uncertainties on cluster ages and evolution models. The low standard deviation of {$\eta$} among clusters ({$\approx$}14~per cent) contrasts with the variety of HB morphologies. Since {$\eta$} incorporates cluster age, this suggests that age accounts for the majority of the `second parameter problem', and that a Reimers-like law provides a good mass-loss model. The remaining spread in {$\eta$} correlates with cluster mass and density, suggesting helium enrichment provides the third parameter explaining HB morphology of GCs. We close by discussing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) mass-loss, finding that the AGB tip luminosity is better reproduced and {$\eta$} has less metallicity dependence if GCs are more co-eval than generally thought.},

  abstract = {The first generations of stars left their chemical fingerprints on metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and its surrounding dwarf galaxies. While instantaneous and homogeneous enrichment implies that groups of conatal stars should have the same element abundances, small amplitudes of abundance scatter are seen at fixed [Fe/H]. Measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter have been made with small high-resolution spectroscopic data sets where measurement uncertainty is small compared to this scatter. In this work, we present a method to use mid-resolution survey data, which have larger errors, to make this measurement. Using APOGEE Data Release 17, we calculate the intrinsic scatter of Al, O, Mg, Si, Ti, Ni, and Mn relative to Fe for 333 metal-poor stars across six classical dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, and 1604 stars across 19 globular clusters (GCs). We calibrate the reported abundance errors in bins of signal-to-noise ratio and [Fe/H] using a high-fidelity halo data set. Applying these calibrated errors to the APOGEE data, we find small amplitudes of average intrinsic abundance scatter in dwarf galaxies ranging from 0.03 to 0.09 dex, with a median value of 0.047 dex. For the GCs, we find intrinsic scatters ranging from 0.01 to 0.11 dex, with particularly high scatter for Al and O. Our measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter place important upper bounds, which are limited by our calibration, on the intrinsic scatter in these systems, as well as constraints on their underlying star formation history and mixing that we can look to simulations to interpret.},

We use FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of 26 isolated galaxies as well as existing observational data for 10 Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our simulated galaxies have stellar masses between 105.5 and 108.6 M{$\odot$}. Whilst gas-phase metallicty gradients are generally weak in our simulated galaxies, we find that stellar metallicity gradients are common, with central regions tending to be more metal-rich than the outer parts. The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients. Stellar metallicty gradients are set by two competing processes: (1) the steady 'puffing' of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations and (2) the accretion of extended, metal-rich gas at late times, which fuels late-time metal-rich star formation. If recent star formation dominates, then extended, metal-rich star formation washes out pre-existing gradients from the 'puffing' process. We use published results from ten Local Group dwarf galaxies to show that a similar relationship between age and stellar metallicity-gradient strength exists among real dwarfs. This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects.},

  abstract = {A uniformly rotating spherical cloud of nearly uniform is supposed to contract into a than disk, with each element of gas conserving its angular momentum. It is shown that if the cloud density is strictly uniform, there exists an axially symmetric disk-like state of centrifugal equilibrium with uniform angular velocity while if the cloud density decreases slightly (according to a specific law) from centre to surface, disk4ike equilibrium is possible with a much more concentrated mass distribution, and with a uniform rotational velocity V. The difference between the two cloud density laws is slight, and it is probable that any nearly uniform sphere in uniform rotation can generate (with the same angular momentum constraint) two disks, with rotation laws that approximate respectively to = constant and V constant. The two models are regarded as smoothed-out, zero-order approximations to the barred and the normal spirals: which disk is formed from the collapsing primeval sphere depends on the relative strengths of the perturbations present.},

The halo consists of Population II stars, with low metallicities and age {$>$}=1010 yr. The finding of a halo in a dwarf irregular galaxy argues for a generic mode of galaxy formation that requires a halo in the presence of a disk, regardless of galaxy size. This implies that formation mechanisms are similar along the spiral Hubble sequence, and favors the scenarios where the formation takes place during the original collapse and accretion of the protogalactic gas clouds. Halo formation also appears not necessarily to be related to the presence of a bulge, or a nucleus, since WLM lacks both of these components.},

Although early surveys showed that the observed spectroscopic binary (SB) fractions in the galactic disk and halo are similar (e.g., Carney-Latham sample), these studies did not correct for incompleteness. In this study, we examine five different surveys and thoroughly account for their underlying selection biases to measure the intrinsic occurrence rate of close solar-type binaries. We reanalyze (1) a volume-limited sample of solar-type stars, (2) the Carney-Latham SB survey of high proper motion stars, (3) various SB samples of metal-poor giants, (4) the APOGEE survey of radial velocity (RV) variables, and (5) eclipsing binaries (EBs) discovered by Kepler. The observed APOGEE RV variability fraction and Kepler EB fraction both decrease by a factor of {$\approx$}4 across -1.0 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} 0.5 at the 22{$\sigma$} and 9{$\sigma$} confidence levels, respectively. After correcting for incompleteness, all five samples/methods exhibit a quantitatively consistent anticorrelation between the intrinsic close binary fraction (a {$<$} 10 au) and metallicity: F close = 53\% {\textpm} 12\%, 40\% {\textpm} 6\%, 24\% {\textpm} 4\%, and 10\% {\textpm} 3\% at [Fe/H] = -3.0, -1.0, -0.2 (mean field metallicity), and +0.5, respectively. We present simple fragmentation models that explain why the close binary fraction of solar-type stars strongly decreases with metallicity while the wide binary fraction, close binary fraction of OB stars, and initial mass function are all relatively constant across -1.5 {$\lessequivlnt$} [Fe/H] {$<$} 0.5. The majority of solar-type stars with [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -1.0 will interact with a stellar companion, which has profound implications for binary evolution in old and metal-poor environments such as the galactic halo, bulge, thick disk, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and high-redshift universe.},

In this review we provide an overview of these various areas. After an overview of the methods used to constrain the chemical enrichment in galaxies and their environment, we discuss the observed scaling relations between metallicity and galaxy properties, the observed relative chemical abundances, how the chemical elements are distributed within galaxies, and how these properties evolve across the cosmic epochs. We discuss how the various observational findings compare with the predictions from theoretical models and numerical cosmological simulations.

After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their respective selection effects, we find that the properties of companions to O-type and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short orbital periods P {$\lessequivlnt$} 20 days (separations a {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.4 au), the binaries have small eccentricities e {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.4, favor modest mass ratios {$<$} q{$>$} {$\approx$} 0.5, and exhibit a small excess of twins q {$>$} 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) {$\approx$} 3.5 (a {$\approx$} 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward small values q {$\approx$} 0.2-0.3 and follow a Maxwellian ``thermal'' eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P (days) {$\approx$} 5.5-7.5 (a {$\approx$} 200-5000 au) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical triples and have a mass ratio distribution across q {$\approx$} 0.1-1.0 that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in the context of binary-star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze the binary statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account that 30\% {\textpm} 10\% of single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely contain white dwarf companions instead of low-mass stellar secondaries. The mean frequency of stellar companions with q {$>$} 0.1 and log P (days) {$<$} 8.0 per primary increases from 0.50 {\textpm} 0.04 for solar-type MS primaries to 2.1 {\textpm} 0.3 for O-type MS primaries.

  abstract = {Recent measurements of the proper motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) show it to be moving in a nearly circular orbit around the Milky Way, and to be leading the Magellanic Stream which stretches in a well- confined arc 100{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} behind it. We present numerical investigations designed to test models of the origin of the Magellanic Stream critically. The most developed model is the tidal model, but this fails to reproduce several characteristic properties of the Stream. (i) High- resolution numerical simulations of tidal stripping show that material stripped from the LMC would retain the internal velocities of the LMC and would define a thick plane surrounding the Milky Way, not the tightly confined wake actually observed. (ii) There is no leading stream as would be expected if it were tidally produced. (iii) The observed radial velocity along the Stream is inconsistent with the observed orbital parameters of the Magellanic Clouds. (iv) The uniform variation in column density along the Stream cannot be reproduced by tidal forces. (v) No stars have been observed within the Stream, but stars should be tidally stripped from the LMC as easily as gas. Recent refinements to the tidal model (Gardiner et al.; Lin et al.) address some, but not all, of these problems. We suggest an alternative model for the origin of the Magellanic Stream which can explain all of its observed features and dynamics, as well as provide a strong constraint on the distribution of gas within the halo of the Milky Way. We propose that the Stream consists of material that was ram-pressure-stripped from the Magellanic System during its last passage through an extended ionized disc of the Galaxy. This collision took place some 500 million years ago at a galactocentric distance of about 65 kpc, and swept {\textasciitilde}20 per cent of the least-bound HI into the Stream. The gas with the lowest column density lost the most orbital angular momentum. At the present time this material is at the tip of the Stream and has fallen to a distance of {\textasciitilde}20 kpc from the Milky Way, attaining a negative velocity of 200 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. To prevent the stripped material from leading the Magellanic Clouds and attaining too large an infall velocity, we postulate the existence of an extended dilute halo of diffuse ionized gas surrounding the Milky Way. If the halo gas is at the virial temperature of the potential well of the Milky Way (2.2 x 10{\textasciicircum}6{\textasciicircum}K), its thermal emission would contribute {\textasciitilde}40 per cent of the observed diffuse background radiation in the 0.5-1.0 keV (M) band, and this is consistent with recent ROSAT measurements as well as pulsar dispersion measures. Ram-pressure stripping from this extended disc and gaseous halo would explain the absence of gas in globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal companions to the Milky Way. Some fraction of the observed high-velocity clouds might be the infalling debris from previous orbits of the LMC through the extended disc.},

We apply this model to 40 dSphs using star counts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, PanStarrs-1 Survey, Dark Energy Survey, and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. Using mock data, we examine systematic errors associated with modeling assumptions and identify conditions under which our model can identify "non-standard" stellar density profiles that have central cusps and/or steepened outer slopes. Applying our model to real dwarf spheroidals, we do not find evidence for centrally cusped density profiles among the fifteen Milky Way satellites for which our tests with mock data indicate there would be sufficient detectability. We do detect steepened (with respect to a standard Plummer model) outer profiles in several dSphs---Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, and Reticulum II---which may point to distinct evolutionary pathways for these objects. However, the outer slope of the stellar density profile does not yet obviously correlate with other observed galaxy properties.},

Orbits are integrated in both an axisymmetric and a nonaxisymmetric Galactic potential that includes a bar and a three-dimensional model for the spiral arms. With the use of a Monte Carlo scheme, we consider in our simulations observational uncertainties in the kinematical data of the clusters. In the analysis of destruction rates due to the bulge--bar, we consider the rigorous treatment of using the real Galactic cluster orbit instead of the usual linear trajectory employed in previous studies. We compare results in both treatments. We find that the theoretical tidal radius computed in the nonaxisymmetric Galactic potential compares better with the observed tidal radius than that obtained in the axisymmetric potential. In both Galactic potentials, bulge-shocking destruction rates computed with a linear trajectory of a cluster at its perigalacticons give a good approximation of the result obtained with the real trajectory of the cluster. Bulge-shocking destruction rates for clusters with perigalacticons in the inner Galactic region are smaller in the nonaxisymmetric potential than those in the axisymmetric potential. For the majority of clusters with high orbital eccentricities (e {$>$} 0.5), their total bulge+disk destruction rates are smaller in the nonaxisymmetric potential.},

We find that this cluster, Mu{\~n}oz 1, is located at a distance of 45 {\textpm} 5 kpc and at a projected distance of only 45' from the center of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using a maximum-likelihood technique we measure a half-light radius of 0farcm5, or equivalently 7 pc, and an ellipticity consistent with being zero. We estimate its absolute magnitude to be MV = -0.4 {\textpm} 0.9, which corresponds to LV = 120+160 -65 L {$\odot$} and we measure a heliocentric radial velocity of -137 {\textpm} 4 km s-1 based on Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy. This new satellite is separate from Ursa Minor by {\textasciitilde}30 kpc and 110 km s-1 suggesting the cluster is not obviously associated with the dSph, despite the very close angular separation. Based on its photometric properties and structural parameters we conclude that Mu{\~n}oz 1 is a new ultra-faint stellar cluster.

Our survey targets an unbiased sample of ``outer halo'' satellites (i.e., substructures having galactocentric distances greater than 25 kpc) and includes classical dSph galaxies, ultra-faint dwarfs, and remote globular clusters. We combine deep, panoramic gr imaging for 44 satellites and archival gr imaging for 14 additional objects (primarily obtained with the DECam instrument as part of the Dark Energy Survey) to measure photometric and structural parameters for 58 outer halo satellites. This is the largest and most uniform analysis of Milky Way satellites undertaken to date and represents roughly three-quarters (58/81 {$\simeq$} 72\%) of all known outer halo satellites. We use a maximum-likelihood method to fit four density laws to each object in our survey: exponential, Plummer, King, and S{\'e}rsic models. We systematically examine the isodensity contour maps and color-magnitude diagrams for each of our program objects, present a comparison with previous results, and tabulate our best-fit photometric and structural parameters, including ellipticities, position angles, effective radii, S{\'e}rsic indices, absolute magnitudes, and surface brightness measurements. We investigate the distribution of outer halo satellites in the size-magnitude diagram and show that the current sample of outer halo substructures spans a wide range in effective radius, luminosity, and surface brightness, with little evidence for a clean separation into star cluster and galaxy populations at the faintest luminosities and surface brightnesses.},

Our sample consists of 58 stellar overdensities---i.e., substructures classified as either globular clusters, classical dwarf galaxies, or ultra-faint dwarf galaxies---that are located at Galactocentric distances of R GC {$\geq$} 25 kpc (outer halo) and out to {$\sim$}400 kpc. This includes 44 objects for which we have acquired deep, wide-field, g- and r-band imaging with the MegaCam mosaic cameras on the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the 6.5 m Magellan-Clay telescope. These data are supplemented by archival imaging, or published gr photometry, for an additional 14 objects, most of which were discovered recently in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We describe the scientific motivation for our survey, including sample selection, observing strategy, data reduction pipeline, calibration procedures, and the depth and precision of the photometry. The typical 5{$\sigma$} point-source limiting magnitudes for our MegaCam imaging---which collectively covers an area of {$\approx$}52 deg2---are g lim {$\simeq$} 25.6 and r lim {$\simeq$} 25.3 AB mag. These limits are comparable to those from the coadded DES images and are roughly a half-magnitude deeper than will be reached in a single visit with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Our photometric catalog thus provides the deepest and most uniform photometric database of Milky Way satellites available for the foreseeable future. In other papers in this series, we have used these data to explore the blue straggler populations in these objects, their density distributions, star formation histories, scaling relations, and possible foreground structures.},

This constitutes all known Milky Way dwarf galaxies (and likely candidates) as of 2020 May, except for the Magellanic Clouds, the Canis Major and Hydra 1 stellar overdensities, and the tidally disrupting Bootes III and Sagittarius dwarf galaxies. We derive systemic proper motions for the first time for Indus 1, DES J0225+0304, Cetus 2, Pictor 2, and Leo T, but note that the latter three rely on photometry that is of poorer quality than that of the rest of the sample. We cannot resolve a signal for Bootes 4, Cetus 3, Indus 2, Pegasus 3, or Virgo 1. Our method is inspired by the maximum likelihood approach of Pace \& Li and examines simultaneously the spatial, color-magnitude, and proper motion distribution of sources. Systemic proper motions are derived without the need to identify confirmed radial velocity members, although the proper motions of these stars, where available, are incorporated into the analysis through a prior on the model. The associated uncertainties on the systemic proper motions are on average a factor of {$\sim$}1.4 smaller than existing literature values. Analysis of the implied membership distribution of the satellites suggests that we accurately identify member stars with a contamination rate lower than 1 in 20.},

The highest resolution simulation represents a single dark matter halo using 4.4 billion particles, of which 1.1 billion end up within the virial radius. Our analysis confirms a number of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues where conflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. The mass profile of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes deviates slightly but systematically from the form proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White. The spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwards and, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is {$\gamma$} {$\equiv$} - d ln {$\rho$}/d ln r {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 1. Asymptotic inner slopes as steep as the recently claimed {$\rho$} {\textasciitilde} r-1.2 are clearly ruled out. The radial dependence of {$\gamma$} is well approximated by a power law, {$\gamma$} {\textasciitilde} r{$\alpha$} (the Einasto profile). The shape parameter, {$\alpha$}, varies slightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profiles of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes are not strictly universal: different haloes cannot, in general, be rescaled to look identical. Departures from similarity are also seen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in density profiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averaged pseudo-phase-space density, {$\rho$}/{$\sigma$}3 {\textasciitilde} r-1.875. The index here is identical to that of Bertschinger's similarity solution for self-similar infall on to a point mass from an otherwise uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe. The origin of this striking behaviour is unclear, but its robustness suggests that it reflects a fundamental structural property of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes. Our conclusions are reliable down to radii below 0.4 per cent of the virial radius, providing well-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects are neglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which the modifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can be judged.},

  abstract = {We construct the first comprehensive dynamical model for the high-quality subset of stellar kinematics of the Milky Way disc, with full 6D phase-space coordinates, provided by the Gaia Data Release 2. We adopt an axisymmetric approximation and use an updated Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which allows for a generic shape and radial orientation of the velocity ellipsoid, as indicated by the Gaia data, to fit the mean velocities and all three components of the intrinsic velocity dispersion tensor. The Milky Way is the first galaxy for which all intrinsic phase space coordinates are available, and the kinematics are superior to the best integral-field kinematics of external galaxies. This situation removes the long-standing dynamical degeneracies and makes this the first dynamical model highly overconstrained by the kinematics. For these reasons, our ability to fit the data provides a fundamental test for both galaxy dynamics and the mass distribution in the Milky Way disc. We tightly constrain the volume average total density logarithmic slope, in the radial range 3.6-12 kpc, to be {$\alpha$}tot = -2.149 {\textpm} 0.055 and find that the dark halo slope must be significantly steeper than {$\alpha$}DM = -1 (NFW). The dark halo shape is close to spherical and its density is {$\rho$}DM(R{$\odot$}) = 0.0115 {\textpm} 0.0020 M{$\odot$} pc-3 (0.437 {\textpm} 0.076 GeV cm-3), in agreement with previous estimates. The circular velocity at the solar position Vcirc(R{$\odot$}) = 236.5 {\textpm} 3.1 km s-1 (including systematics) and its gently declining radial trends are also consistent with recent determinations.},

  abstract = {The evolution of a binary star system by various analytical and numerical approximations of mass transfer rate normalized to the equilibrium rate and its stability conditions are investigated. We present results from investigations of mass transfer and stability in close binary star systems using the different orbital parameters. The stability and instability of mass transfer in binary star evolution depends on the exchange of material which the response of the binary to the initial Roche lobe overflow causes the donor to loose even more material. Our work is mainly focused on basic mathematical derivations, analytical and numerical solutions in order to explain the mass transfer system in different orbital parameters as well as the results are compared with previous studies in both cases. Mass transfer is usually stable, as long as the winds specific angular momentum does not exceed the angular momentum per reduced mass of the system. This holds for both dynamical and thermal time scales. Those systems which are not stable will usually transfer mass on the thermal time scale. The variation of Roche lobe radius with mass ratio in the binary, for various orbital parameters in the conservative and non-conservative mass transfer, as well as the evolution equations, orbital angular momentum of the binary system and the corresponding analytical and numerical solutions for different cases, under certain restrictive approximations is derived, simulated and discussed.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

  abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

The deep (g {$\sim$} 24) SMASH color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) clearly reveal old ({$\sim$}9 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] {$\approx$} -0.8 dex) main-sequence stars at a distance of {$\sim$}50 kpc. The surface brightness of these detections is extremely low with our most distant detection at {$\Sigma$} g {$\approx$} 34 mag arcsec-2. The SMASH radial density profile breaks from the inner LMC exponential decline at {$\sim$}13{$^\circ$}-15{$^\circ$} and a second component at larger radii has a shallower slope with power-law index {$\alpha$} = -2.2 that contributes {$\sim$}0.4\% of the LMC's total stellar mass. In addition, the SMASH densities exhibit large scatter around our best-fit model of {$\sim$}70\% indicating that the envelope of stellar material in the LMC periphery is highly disturbed. We also use data from the NOAO Source catalog to map the LMC main-sequence populations at intermediate radii and detect a steep dropoff in density on the eastern side of the LMC (at R {$\approx$} 8{$^\circ$}) as well as an extended structure to the far northeast. These combined results confirm the existence of a very extended, low-density envelope of stellar material with a disturbed shape around the LMC. The exact origin of this structure remains unclear, but the leading options include an accreted halo or tidally stripped outer disk material.},

The most striking abundance feature is the alpha-abundance bimodality. The low-alpha stars are younger (1-8 Gyr) while the high-alpha stars are older (8-12 Gyr) and have a thicker distribution. While there are a number of models that can reproduce the Milky Way alpha-bimodality, none are strongly favored by the data. However, they do make different predictions about the prevalence of the alpha-bimodality in Milky Way-mass galaxies. Our Cycle 1 JWST NIRspec program has obtained high-S/N, medium-resolution spectra of over 100 stars in one M31 disk field. We have measured stellar parameters, radial velocities, and alpha-abundances using a set of synthetic spectra. No alpha-bimodality exists in the M31 JWST abundances and the data can be explainedy by a single, high star formation efficiency evolutionary track similar to what is seen in the MW bulge. While this result is somewhat surprising, the larger accretion and merger rate of M31 is likely responsible for the different chemical pattern.},

The Milky Way has two chemically-defined disks, the low-{$\alpha$} and high-{$\alpha$} disks, which are closely related to the thin and thick disks, respectively. The origin of the two populations and the {$\alpha$}-bimodality between them is not entirely clear, although there are now several models that can reproduce the observed features. To help constrain the models and discern the origin, we have undertaken a study of the chemical abundances of the M31 disk using JWST NIRSpec, in order to determine whether stars in M31's disk also show an {$\alpha$}-abundance bimodality. Approximately 100 stars were observed in our single NIRSpec field at a projected distance of 18 kpc from the M31 center. The 1-D extracted spectra have an average signal-to-noise ratio of 85 leading to statistical metallicity precision of 0.016 dex, {$\alpha$}-abundance precision of 0.012 dex, and a radial velocity precision 8 km s-1 (mostly from systematics). The initial results indicate that, in contrast to the Milky Way, there is no {$\alpha$}-bimodality in the M31 disk, and no low-{$\alpha$} sequence. The entire stellar population falls along a single chemical sequence very similar to the MW's high-{$\alpha$} component which had a high star formation rate. While this is somewhat unexpected, the result is not that surprising based on other studies that found the M31 disk has a larger velocity dispersion than the MW and is dominated by a thick component. M31 has had a more active accretion and merger history than the MW which might explain the chemical differences.},

Building upon our previous work, our model is now fitted to kinematic maps that have been extended to larger galactocentric radii due to the expansion of our data set, probing the outer regions of the Galactic disk. Our best-fitting dynamical model suggests a logarithmic density slope of {$\alpha$}DM = -1.602 {\textpm} 0.079syst for the dark matter halo and a dark matter density of {$\rho$}DM(R{$\odot$}) = (8.92 {\textpm} 0.56syst) {\texttimes} 10-3 M{$\odot$} pc-3 (0.339 {\textpm} 0.022syst GeV cm3).

While the statistical errors are small, the error budget of the derived quantities is dominated by the three to seven times larger systematic uncertainties. These values are consistent with our previous determination, but the systematic uncertainties are reduced due to the extended data set covering a larger spatial extent of the Milky Way disk. Furthermore, we test the influence of nonaxisymmetric features on our resulting model and analyze how a flaring disk model would change our findings.},

They are also unaffected by depletion onto dust grains, unlike the cold/warm interstellar medium (ISM) or H ii regions. Aims: A carefully selected sample of early B-type stars in OB associations and the field within the solar neighbourhood is studied comprehensively. Quantitative spectroscopy is used to characterise their atmospheric properties in a self-consistent way. Present-day abundances for the astrophysically most interesting chemical elements are derived in order to investigate whether a present-day cosmic abundance standard can be established. Methods: High-resolution and high-S/N FOCES, FEROS and ELODIE spectra of well-studied sharp-lined early B-type stars are analysed in non-LTE. Line-profile fits based on extensive model grids and an iterative analysis methodology are used to constrain stellar parameters and elemental abundances at high accuracy and precision. Atmospheric parameters are derived from the simultaneous establishment of independent indicators, from multiple ionization equilibria and the Stark-broadened hydrogen Balmer lines, and they are confirmed by reproduction of the stars' global spectral energy distributions. Results: Effective temperatures are constrained to 1-2\% and surface gravities to less than 15\% uncertainty, along with accurate rotational, micro- and macroturbulence velocities. Good agreement of the resulting spectroscopic parallaxes with those from the new reduction of the Hipparcos catalogue is obtained. Absolute values for abundances of He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe are determined to better than 25\% uncertainty. The synthetic spectra match the observations reliably over almost the entire visual spectral range. Three sample stars, {$\gamma$} Ori, o Per and {\texttheta}1 Ori D, are identified as double-lined, indicating the presence of an early/mid B-type companion. Conclusions: A present-day cosmic abundance standard is established from a sample of 29 early B-type stars, indicating abundance fluctuations of less than 10\% around the mean. Our results (i) resolve the long-standing discrepancy between a chemical homogeneous gas-phase ISM and a chemically inhomogeneous young stellar component out to several hundred parsec from the Sun, (ii) facilitate the amount of heavy elements locked up in the interstellar dust to be constrained precisely - the results imply that carbonaceous dust is largely destroyed inside the Orion H ii region, unlike the silicates, and that graphite is only a minority species in interstellar dust -, (iii) show that the mixing of CNO-burning products in the course of massive star evolution follows tightly the predicted nuclear path, (iv) provide reliable present-day reference points for anchoring Galactic chemical evolution models to observation, and (v) imply that the Sun has migrated outwards from the inner Galactic disk over its lifetime from a birthplace at a distance around 5-6 kpc from the Galactic Centre; a cancellation of the effects of Galactic chemical evolution and abundance gradients leads to the similarity of solar and present-day cosmic abundances in the solar neighbourhood, with a telltaling signature of the Sun's origin left in the C/O ratio.

  abstract = {We present high-resolution rotation curves and mass models of 26 dwarf galaxies from ``Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The H i Nearby Galaxy Survey'' (LITTLE THINGS). LITTLE THINGS is a high-resolution ({$\sim$}6{${''}$} angular; {$<$}2.6 km s-1 velocity resolution) Very Large Array H i survey for nearby dwarf galaxies in the local volume within 11 Mpc. The high-resolution H i observations enable us to derive reliable rotation curves of the sample galaxies in a homogeneous and consistent manner. The rotation curves are then combined with Spitzer archival 3.6 {$\mu$}m and ancillary optical U, B, and V images to construct mass models of the galaxies. This high quality multi-wavelength data set significantly reduces observational uncertainties and thus allows us to examine the mass distribution in the galaxies in detail. We decompose the rotation curves in terms of the dynamical contributions by baryons and dark matter (DM) halos, and compare the latter with those of dwarf galaxies from THINGS as well as {$\Lambda$}CDM Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations in which the effect of baryonic feedback processes is included. Being generally consistent with THINGS and simulated dwarf galaxies, most of the LITTLE THINGS sample galaxies show a linear increase of the rotation curve in their inner regions, which gives shallower logarithmic inner slopes {$\alpha$} of their DM density profiles. The mean value of the slopes of the 26 LITTLE THINGS dwarf galaxies is {$\alpha$} =-0.32+/- 0.24 which is in accordance with the previous results found for low surface brightness galaxies ({$\alpha$} =-0.2+/- 0.2) as well as the seven THINGS dwarf galaxies ({$\alpha$} =-0.29+/- 0.07). However, this significantly deviates from the cusp-like DM distribution predicted by DM-only {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations. Instead our results are more in line with the shallower slopes found in the {$\Lambda$}CDM SPH simulations of dwarf galaxies in which the effect of baryonic feedback processes is included. In addition, we discuss the central DM distribution of DDO 210 whose stellar mass is relatively low in our sample to examine the scenario of inefficient supernova feedback in low mass dwarf galaxies predicted from recent {$\Lambda$}CDM SPH simulations of dwarf galaxies where central cusps still remain.},

We present numerical simulations of tidal interactions between these low-density dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the Milky Way. Our results indicate that dwarf spheroidal galaxies with limiting radius much larger than the theoretical tidal radius are unstable and likely to be tidally disrupted on a Hubble time. However, dwarf spheroidal gal galaxies can survive over a Hubble time if their limiting radii are less than twice their tidal radii at perigalacticon. In a galaxy which is undergoing tidal disruption, (1) the projected surface density is flattened in the galaxy's orbital plane and follows a power-law distribution from the galaxy's center, (2) the velocity dispersion is sustained at the current virial equilibrium value, and (3) the central density of the residual remnant is maintained even after most of the initial mass is lost. Beyond the tidal radius, the escapers have a radial velocity gradient along the azimuthal direction of the galaxy's motion. When compared with observational data, our theoretical results are consistent with the scenarios that (1) some dwarf spheroidal galaxies contain dark matter, and (2) some dwarf spheroidal galaxies may be part of the debris that was tidally torn from the LMC by the Galaxy.},

The main sequence turnoff is easily visible. Fits to evolutionary isochrones and the globular cluster M92 indicate that Ursa Minor has an age and metal abundance very similar to that of the latter cluster. No evidence for stars younger than about 16 billion years is seen, with the possible exception of approximately 20 stars believed to be blue stragglers. Ursa Minor is therefore an extreme-age galaxy, unlike superficially similar objects such as the Carina dwarf. Indeed, Ursa Minor may be the only outer-halo spheroidal whose stellar content lives up to the classical ideals of a Population II system. A surprising result of the study is the discovery of clumpiness in the distribution of stars. This finding may give more weight to the idea that dwarf spheroidal galaxies were previously dwarf irregular galaxies, although clearly, if so, Ursa Minor must have lost its gaseous content very soon after formation.},

Of the 118 stars in our sample with multiple observations, six are velocity variables with X{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} probabilities below 0.001. We use Monte Carlo simulations that mimic our observations to determine the efficiency with which our observations find binary stars. Our best, though significantly uncertain, estimate of the binary frequency for stars near the turnoff in Draco and UMi is 0.2-0.3 per decade of period in the vicinity of periods of one year, which is 3-5X that found for the solar neighborhood. This frequency is high enough that binary stars might significantly affect the measured velocity dispersions of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies according to some previous numerical experiments. However, in the course of performing our own experiments, we discovered that this previous work had inadvertently overestimated binary orbital velocities. Our first set of simulations of the effects of binaries is based on the observed scatter in the individual velocity measurements for the multiply-observed Draco and Ursa Minor stars. This scatter is small compared to measured velocity dispersions and, so, the effect of binaries on the dispersions is slight. This result is supported by our second set of experiments, which are based on a model binary population normalized by the observed binary frequency in Draco and Ursa Minor. We conclude that binary stars have had no significant effect on the measured velocity dispersion and inferred mass-to-light ratio of any dwarf spheroidal galaxy.},

  abstract = {The cosmological constant + cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) theory is the 'standard model' of cosmology. Encoded in it are extremely accurate descriptions of the large scale structure of the Universe, despite a very limited number of degrees of freedom. The model struggles, however, to explain some measurements on galactic and smaller scales. The shape of the dark matter distribution toward the centres of galaxies is predicted to be steeply increasing in density ('cuspy') by the theory, yet observations of the rotation curves of some galaxies suggest that it instead reaches a central density plateau (a 'core'). This discrepancy is termed the 'cusp-core problem'. I propose a new way of quantifying this problem as a diversity in the central mass content of galaxies. This characterization does not distinguish between dark and ordinary ('baryonic') matter, but the apparent problem is so severe that the signature of the cusp-core discrepancy is still obvious. By formulating the problem in this way, several uncertain modelling steps are effectively removed from the discussion, allowing for a more narrowly focussed examination of remaining steps in the analysis. My subsequent comparison of recent results from galaxy formation simulations and observed galaxies in the space of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) reveals some galaxies with an apparent anomalously low dark matter content not only in the centre, but out to the largest measurable radii. These objects are very difficult to explain within the {$\Lambda$}CDM framework; the most plausible interpretation which emerges is that the effect of systematic uncertainties in modelling the kinematics in these galaxies -- particularly in the estimate of their inclinations -- has been substantially underestimated. This motivates a re-examination of rotation curve measurement methods. I use a collection of simulated galaxies to demonstrate that, when these are synthetically 'observed' and modelled analogously to real galaxies, non-circular motions present in the gas discs give the appearance of cores, even though all of the simulated galaxies have central cusps. The errors are large enough to reproduce the full width of the observed scatter in rotation curve shapes. Provided the simulations produce sufficiently faithful models of real galaxies, these modelling errors could constitute a solution to the cusp-core problem within the {$\Lambda$}CDM paradigm. Regardless, the kinematic models must be better understood before drawing any strong cosmological conclusions.},

The column density of the neutral hydrogen in the z{\textasciitilde}=2.536 Lyman limit system is high, logNHI=19.422+/-0.009 cm-2, allowing for the deuterium to be seen in five Lyman series transitions. The measured value of the D/H ratio toward QSO HS 0105+1619 is found to be D/H=2.54+/-0.23{\texttimes}10-5. The metallicity of the system showing D/H is found to be {\textasciitilde}=0.01 solar, indicating that the measured D/H is the primordial D/H within the measurement errors. The gas that shows D/H is neutral, unlike previous D/H systems that were more highly ionized. Thus, the determination of the D/H ratio becomes more secure since we are measuring it in different astrophysical environments, but the error is larger because we now see more dispersion between measurements. Combined with prior measurements of D/H, the best D/H ratio is now D/H=3.0+/-0.4{\texttimes}10-5, which is 10\% lower than the previous value.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of "posterior collapse" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.},

We find abundances totally consistent with those provided by the direct method when we apply this method to a sample of objects with an empirical determination of the electron temperature using optical emission lines.

  abstract = {We present a method for identifying localized secondary populations in stellar velocity data using Bayesian statistical techniques. We apply this method to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor and find two secondary objects in this satellite of the Milky Way. One object is kinematically cold with a velocity dispersion of 4.25 {\textpm} 0.75 km s-1 and centred at (9.1 arcmin {\textpm} 1.5, 7.2 arcmin {\textpm} 1.2) in relative RA and Dec. with respect to the centre of Ursa Minor. The second object has a large velocity offset of -12.8{\textasciicircum}\{+1.75\}\_\{-1.5\} \{km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\} compared to Ursa Minor and centred at (-14.0 arcmin{\textasciicircum}\{+2.4\}\_\{-5.8\}, -2.5 arcmin{\textasciicircum}\{+0.4\}\_\{-1.0\}). The kinematically cold object has been found before using a smaller data set, but the prediction that this cold object has a velocity dispersion larger than 2.0 km s-1 at 95 per cent confidence level differs from previous work. We use two- and three-component models along with the information criteria and Bayesian evidence model selection methods to argue that Ursa Minor has additional localized secondary populations. The significant probability for a large velocity dispersion in each secondary object raises the intriguing possibility that each has its own dark matter halo, that is, it is a satellite of a satellite of the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {We present a Bayesian method to identify multiple (chemodynamic) stellar populations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using velocity, metallicity, and positional stellar data without the assumption of spherical symmetry. We apply this method to a new Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) spectroscopic survey of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dSph. We identify 892 likely members, making this the largest UMi sample with line-of-sight velocity and metallicity measurements. Our Bayesian method detects two distinct chemodynamic populations with high significance (in logarithmic Bayes factor, ln B {\textasciitilde} 33). The metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -2.05 {\textpm} 0.03) population is kinematically colder (radial velocity dispersion of \${\textbackslash}sigma \_v=4.9\_\{-1.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.8\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) and more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor (\$[\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe/H\}]=-2.29\_\{-0.06\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\$) and kinematically hotter population (\${\textbackslash}sigma \_v =11.5\_\{-0.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.9\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). Furthermore, we apply the same analysis to an independent Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT)/Hectochelle data set and confirm the existence of two chemodynamic populations in UMi. In both data sets, the metal-rich population is significantly flattened ({$\epsilon$} = 0.75 {\textpm} 0.03) and the metal-poor population is closer to spherical (\${\textbackslash}epsilon =0.33\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$). Despite the presence of two populations, we are able to robustly estimate the slope of the dynamical mass profile. We found hints for prolate rotation of order \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}2 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in the MMT data set, but further observations are required to verify this. The flattened metal-rich population invalidates assumptions built into simple dynamical mass estimators, so we computed new astrophysical dark matter annihilation (J) and decay profiles based on the rounder, hotter metal-poor population and inferred \${\textbackslash}log \_\{10\}\{(J(0\{{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\_\{.\}\}5)/\{{\textbackslash}rm GeV{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}, cm{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\})\}{\textbackslash}approx 19.1\$ for the Keck data set. Our results paint a more complex picture of the evolution of UMi than previously discussed.},

For these orbits, we use a Monte Carlo sample for the observational uncertainties for each dSph and the uncertainties in the MW and LMC potentials. We predict that Ant II, Boo III, Cra II, Gru II, and Tuc III should be tidally disrupting by comparing each dSph's average density relative to the MW density at its pericenter. dSphs with large ellipticity (CVn I, Her, Tuc V, UMa I, UMa II, UMi, Wil 1) show a preference for their orbital direction to align with their major axis even for dSphs with large pericenters. We compare the dSph radial orbital phase to subhalos in MW-like N-body simulations and infer that there is not an excess of satellites near their pericenter. With projections of future Gaia data releases, we find that dSph's orbital precision will be limited by uncertainties in the distance and/or MW potential rather than in proper motion precision. Finally, we provide our membership catalogs to enable community follow-up.},

  abstract = {We present a new, probabilistic method for determining the systemic proper motions of Milky Way (MW) ultra-faint satellites in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We utilize the superb photometry from the first public data release (DR1) of the DES to select candidate members and cross-match them with the proper motions from the Gaia DR2. We model the candidate members with a mixture model (satellite and MW) in spatial and proper motion space. This method does not require prior knowledge of satellite membership and can successfully determine the tangential motion of 13 DES satellites. With our method, we present measurements of the following satellites: Columba I, Eridanus III, Grus II, Phoenix II, Pictor I, Reticulum III, and Tucana IV. This is the first systemic proper motion measurement for several of these satellites, and the majority lack extensive spectroscopic follow-up studies. We compare these to the predictions of Large Magellanic Cloud satellites and the vast polar structure. With the high-precision DES photometry, we conclude that most of the newly identified member stars are very metal-poor ([Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -2), similar to other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, while Reticulum III is likely more metal-rich. We also find potential members in the following satellites that might indicate their overall proper motion: Cetus II, Kim 2, and Horologium II. However, due to the small number of members in each satellite, spectroscopic follow-up observations are necessary to determine the systemic proper motion in these satellites.},

  abstract = {The Lambda cold dark matter (DM) model successfully explains the distribution of large scale structure and the cosmic microwave background but, there are several problems concerning the distribution of DM on sub-galactic scales. Robust measurements of the distribution of DM in low mass dwarf galaxies are key to understand the true nature of DM. In this work, we present two new techniques for characterizing the kinematics of dispersion supported systems. The first method identifies localized kinematic substructure in line-of-sight velocity data while the second separates global stellar populations utilizing metallicty, line-of-sight velocity, and spatial information. We apply the first method to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor and find two localized kinematic substructures at high significance. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of Ursa Minor, motivated by the previous detection, which form the largest spectroscopic data set of Ursa Minor. With the new data, we identify two chemodynamical stellar population at high significance with distinct kinematic, metallicity, and spatial distributions. By utilizing the dynamics of multiple stellar populations we break halo profile degeneracies and find the DM slope is more consistent with a 'cored' halo than a 'cuspy' halo. We present a complementary study comparing a large sample of literature rotation curves to dark matter halos influenced by baryonic processes. The analysis suggests that baryonic processes are an inconsistent solution to the 'core-cusp' problem.},

  abstract = {This thesis provides evidence that the outer halo of the Milky Way Galaxy has in the past, and continues presently, to accumulate stars and stellar systems from satellite galaxies. The results of three experiments support this conclusion: We search the distribution of possible orbital poles of all Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters for co-orbiting objects, an expected signature for the products of tidal disruption. The principal results are: (1)It is statistically more likely that outer halo (Rgc {$>$} 8 kpc) ``red horizontal branch'' globular clusters share orbits similar to the dwarf satellite galaxies than do outer halo ``blue horizontal branch/metal-poor'' globular clusters. (2)The most distant, outer halo globular clusters (Rgc {$>$} 25 kpc) Pal 4, NGC 6229, NGC 7006, and Pyxis are most likely to share an orbit with the Galactic satellite galaxies. A more complete, dynamical analysis of those globular clusters and satellite galaxies with known space motions finds little evidence for common orbits among the 41 clusters and any of the 6 satellite galaxies. This is to be expected, however, since the majority of the 41 globular clusters are inner halo (Rgc {$<$} 8 kpc), blue horizontal branch/metal-poor or disk clusters. Motivated by the study above, a first measurement of the radial velocity of the Pyxis globular cluster is presented, and reveals that it can only share the orbital pole of the Magellanic Clouds (an association predicted by the orbital pole analysis) if it is on an eccentric orbit ({$\varepsilon$} {$>$} 0.7). However, the few outer halo clusters with known orbits are found on very eccentric orbits. An analysis of the Ursa Minor dwarf galaxy reveals a large population of stars outside its nominal tidal radius. These stars, if unbound to Ursa Minor, suggest that the galaxy is losing up to a third of its mass per Gyr to the Milky Way, a conclusion that supports the overall premise of this thesis, that the Galaxy is growing from the accretion of satellite galaxies. The morphology of this satellite galaxy is peculiar even within its tidal radius, which further suggests an ongoing interaction with the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {We present computations of nucleosynthesis in low-mass (LM) red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of Population I experiencing extended mixing. We adopt the updated version of the FRANEC evolutionary model, a new post-process code for non-convective mixing and the most recent revisions for solar abundances. In this framework, we discuss the effects of recent improvements in relevant reaction rates for proton captures on intermediate-mass (IM) nuclei (from carbon to aluminum). For each nucleus, we briefly discuss the new choices and their motivations. The calculations are then performed on the basis of a parameterized circulation, where the effects of the new nuclear inputs are best compared to previous works. We find that the new rates (and notably the one for the 14N(p, {$\gamma$})15O reaction) imply considerable modifications in the composition of post-main-sequence stars. In particular, the slight temperature changes due to the reduced efficiency of proton captures on 14N induce abundance variations at the first dredge-up (especially for 17O, whose equilibrium ratio to 16O is very sensitive to the temperature). In this new scenario, presolar oxide grains of AGB origin turn out to be produced almost exclusively by very low mass stars (M {$\leq$} 1.5--1.7 M{$\Sun$}), never becoming C-rich. The whole population of grains with 18O/16O below 0.0015 (the limit permitted by first dredge-up) is now explained. Also, there is now no forbidden area for very low values of 17O/16O (below 0.0005), contrary to previous findings. A rather shallow type of transport seems to be sufficient for the CNO changes in RGB stages. Both thermohaline diffusion and magnetic-buoyancy-induced mixing might provide a suitable physical mechanism for this. Thermohaline mixing is in any case certainly inadequate to account for the production of 26Al on the AGB. Other transport mechanisms must therefore be at play. In general, observational constraints from RGB and AGB stars, as well as from presolar grains, are well reproduced by our approach. The nitrogen isotopic ratio in mainstream SiC grains remains an exception. For the low values measured in them (i.e., for 14N/15N {$\leq$}2000), we have no explanation. Actually, for the several grains with subsolar nitrogen isotopic ratios, no known stellar process acting in LM stars can provide a clue. This might be an evidence that some form of contamination from cosmic ray spallation occurs in the interstellar medium, adding fresh 15N to the grains.},

  abstract = {All stellar evolution models require an initial isotopic abundance set as input, but these abundances are well known only for the Sun. Yet, input compositions can be estimated by scaling solar abundances using a previously constructed isotopic history model based on astrophysical processes in the Galaxy. This method, however, may not work for obtaining inputs for compositions that have distinct chemical histories from the Galaxy. We thus present a partial isotopic history model for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy based on astrophysical processes, which can be used to estimate input isotopic abundances in future nucleosynthesis studies. The model is fitted to observational data, and follows the methodology of the previously constructed isotopic history model for the Galaxy. First, we estimate the isotopic composition of Sculptor's late-stage evolution (LSE) using the OMEGA chemical evolution code, and then decompose that composition into contributions from various astrophysical sources. Each contribution is then assumed to scale as a function of metallicity. The isotopic abundances are summed into elemental abundances and fit to available observational elemental abundance data to tune the model's free parameters. The result is an average isotopic history model of Sculptor for massive star, Type Ia SNe, s-process, and r-process contributions that uses elemental data to constrain the isotopic abundances. As an example, our model finds that Type Ia SNe contribute {$\approx$} 87 percent to the LSE Fe abundance, and neutron star mergers contribute {$\approx$} 36 percent to the LSE Eu abundance, in agreement with previous studies.},

One-dimensional simulations of red and asymptotic giant branch stars with mass loss rates from 10-3 up to a few M {$\odot$}yr-1 show in no case any significant radius increase. The largest radius increase of 0.2\% was found in the case with the lowest mass loss rate. For dynamical-timescale mass loss rates that may be encountered during a common envelope phase, the evolution is not adiabatic. The superadiabatic outer layer of the giant's envelope has a local thermal timescale comparable to the dynamical timescale. Therefore, this layer has enough time to readjust thermally. Moreover, the giant star is driven out of hydrostatic equilibrium and evolves dynamically. In these cases no increase of the stellar radius with respect to its initial value is found. If the mass loss rate is high enough, the superadiabaticity of the outer layer is lost progressively and a radiative zone forms due to a combination of thermal and dynamical readjustment. Conditions for unstable mass transfer based on adiabatic mass loss models that predict a significant radius increase may need to be re-evaluated.},

Many of these faint satellites are posited to have been accreted as satellites of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). Using their six-dimensional phase-space information, we calculate the orbital histories of 13 ultrafaint satellites and five classical dwarf spheroidals in a combined MW+LMC+SMC potential to determine which galaxies are dynamically associated with the MCs. These 18 galaxies are separated into four classes: (I) long-term Magellanic satellites that have been bound to the MCs for at least the last two consecutive orbits around the MCs (Carina 2, Carina 3, Horologium 1, Hydrus 1); (II) Magellanic satellites that were recently captured by the MCs {$<$} 1 Gyr ago (Reticulum 2, Phoenix 2); (III) MW satellites that have interacted with the MCs (Sculptor 1, Tucana 3, Segue 1); and (IV) MW satellites (Aquarius 2, Canes Venatici 2, Crater 2, Draco 1, Draco 2, Hydra 2, Carina, Fornax, Ursa Minor). Results are reported for a range of MW and LMC masses. Contrary to previous work, we find no dynamical association between Carina, Fornax, and the MCs. Finally, we determine that the addition of the SMC's gravitational potential affects the longevity of satellites as members of the Magellanic system (long-term versus recently captured), but it does not change the total number of Magellanic satellites.},

  abstract = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded from the project Web site (http://mesa.sourceforge.net/).},

  abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M {$\odot$} stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results.},

MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates ``on-the-fly'' from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's development.},

Our new approach to locating convective boundaries is consistent with the physics of convection, and yields reliable values of the convective-core mass during both hydrogen- and helium-burning phases. Stars with M{$<$} 8 M{$\odot$} become white dwarfs and cool to the point where the electrons are degenerate and the ions are strongly coupled, a realm now available to study with MESA due to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent heat release, and blending of equations of state. Studies of the final fates of massive stars are extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann solver that captures shocks and conserves energy to high accuracy during dynamic epochs. We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the effects of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version of the STELLA radiation transfer instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernova properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of pair-instability supernovae, pulsational pair-instability supernovae, and the formation of stellar-mass black holes. The applicability of MESA is now widened by the capability to import multidimensional hydrodynamic models into MESA. We close by introducing software modules for handling floating point exceptions and stellar model optimization, as well as four new software tools - MESA-Web, MESA-Docker, pyMESA, and mesastar.org - to enhance MESA's education and research impact.},

RSP is a new functionality in MESAstar that models the nonlinear radial stellar pulsations that characterize RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and other classes of variable stars.

For example, this enables calculations through the He flash that conserve energy to better than 0.001\%.

  abstract = {In this work, two new axisymmetric models for the Galactic mass distribution are presented. Motivated by recent results, these two models include the contribution of a stellar thin disc and of a thick disc, as massive as the thin counterpart but with a shorter scale-length. Both models satisfy a number of observational constraints: stellar densities at the solar vicinity, thin and thick disc scale lengths and heights, rotation curve(s), and the absolute value of the perpendicular force Kz as a function of distance to the Galactic centre. We numerically integrate into these new models the motion of all Galactic globular clusters for which distances, proper motions, and radial velocities are available, and the orbits of about one thousand stars in the solar vicinity. The retrieved orbital characteristics are compared to those obtained by integrating the clusters and stellar orbits in pure thin disc models. We find that, due to the possible presence of a thick disc, the computed orbital parameters of disc stars can vary by as much as 30-40\%. We also show that the systematic uncertainties that affect the rotation curve still plague computed orbital parameters of globular clusters by similar amounts.},

A key test of this hypothesis is that forming superclusters of galaxies should generate a systematic infall of other galaxies. This would be evident in the pattern of recessional velocities, causing an anisotropy in the inferred spatial clustering of galaxies. Here we report a precise measurement of this clustering, using the redshifts of more than 141,000 galaxies from the two-degree-field (2dF) galaxy redshift survey. We determine the parameter {$\beta$} = {\textohm}0.6/b = 0.43 +/- 0.07, where {\textohm} is the total mass-density parameter of the Universe and b is a measure of the `bias' of the luminous galaxies in the survey. (Bias is the difference between the clustering of visible galaxies and of the total mass, most of which is dark.) Combined with the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, our results favour a low-density Universe with {\textohm} {\textasciitilde} 0.3.},

We measured emission-line intensities in the spectral range from 1600 to 10000 {\AA} on Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) long-slit spectra of 18 starburst galaxies in the local universe. We determined chemical abundances through traditional nebular analysis, and we used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to determine where our carbon and oxygen abundances lie in the parameter space. We conclude that our C and O abundance measurements are sensible. We analyzed the behavior of our sample in the [C/O] versus [O/H] diagram with respect to other objects such as DLAs, neutral ISM measurements, and disk and halo stars, finding that each type of object seems to be located in a specific region of the diagram. Our sample shows a steeper C/O versus O/H slope with respect to other samples, suggesting that massive stars contribute more to the production of C than N at higher metallicities, only for objects where massive stars are numerous; otherwise, intermediate-mass stars dominate the C and N production.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to explore the effects of tidal stripping on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically motivated initial conditions where dSphs are modeled as King spheres, embedded in Navarro-Frenk-White dark halos and orbiting the Galactic potential on eccentric orbits. As expected, systems that orbit through dense regions of the Galaxy lose a significant fraction of stars after each pericentric passage. These episodes of mass loss, however, do not impose a clear tidal cutoff on the bound stellar core. Rather, once equilibrium has been re-established the outer mass profile approaches a power law well described by a simple Plummer model. As noted in earlier work, tides also result in transient features in the outer density profile. As the system relaxes, an outward-moving "excess" of stars is found at radii where the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsed since pericenter. If the orbit of the dSph is known, these results provide a simple way to assess whether "breaks" and "bumps" in the outer profile of dSphs are actually tidal in origin. We apply this to the Sagittarius dwarf and, encouragingly, identify two features in the surface brightness profile that may be traced to its two last pericentric passages. Applied to Leo I, our results predict that any tidal break would occur at radii beyond those surveyed by current data, casting doubt on recent claims of the detection of tidal debris around this galaxy. For Carina, our model indicates that the tidal break should occur at a radius twice farther than observed. This suggests that the outer excess of stars in Carina is not tidal in origin unless its orbit is in error. A similar comment applies to Sculptor, whose pericenter appears too large for Galactic tides to be important but whose outer profile, like that of Draco, nonetheless follows closely a Plummer law. Fornax and Leo II show no sign of a power-law outer profile, suggesting that they have not been significantly affected by tides. Published profiles for other Milky Way dSph companions do not extend sufficiently far to allow for conclusive assessment. Panoramic surveys that extend surface brightness profiles beyond {\textasciitilde}10 core radii, together with improved constraints on the orbital parameters of dSphs, are needed in order to establish the true origin of the outer envelopes of stars surrounding dSphs.},

We show that accounting for the presence of the LMC systematically lowers the Local Group mass (MLG) derived from the relative motion of the Milky Way--Andromeda pair. Motivated by this result, we apply a Bayesian technique devised by Pe{\~n}arrubia et~al. to simultaneously fit (i) distances and velocities of galaxies within 3~Mpc and (ii) the relative motion between the Milky Way and Andromeda derived from HST observations, with the LMC mass (MLMC) as a free parameter.

Consequently, these results suggest that the LMC may induce significant perturbations on the Galactic potential.},

  abstract = {We use analytical and \$N\$-body methods to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes that host a sizeable subhalo population. Dark subhaloes generate a fluctuating gravitational field that injects energy into stellar orbits, driving a gradual expansion of dSphs. Despite the overall expansion, the stellar density profile preserves its initial shape, suggesting that the evolution proceeds in a self-similar manner. Meanwhile, the velocity dispersion profile, initially flat, evolves as the galaxy expands: the inner regions heat up, while the outer regions cool down. Kinematically, this resembles gravothermal collapse but with an inverted evolution, instead of collapsing the stellar system expands within a fluctuating halo potential. As the half-light radius \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm half\}\$ approaches the halo peak velocity radius \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$, the expansion slows, and the velocity dispersion peaks at \${$\sigma\_$}\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} {\textbackslash}simeq 0.27 v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$. The stellar heat capacity remains positive for deeply embedded stars but diverges near \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$, turning negative beyond this threshold, which indicates a phase transition in the dynamical response to energy injection. The relaxation time scales as \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rel\} {\textbackslash}sim r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm half\}{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}\$, showing that orbital diffusion slows as the galaxy expands. Ultra-faint dSphs, having the smallest sizes and shortest relaxation times, are particularly sensitive to the presence of dark subhaloes. Some of our dSph models expand beyond the detection of current photometric surveys, becoming `stealth' galaxies with half-light radii and velocity dispersions similar to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), but orders of magnitude lower luminosities, representing a distinct, yet currently undetected, population of DM-dominated satellites.},

  abstract = {We use the APOSTLE suite of cosmological simulations to examine the role of the cosmic ionizing background in regulating star formation (SF) in low-mass LCDM halos. In agreement with earlier work, we find that, after reionization, SF can only proceed in halos whose mass exceeds a redshift-dependent ``critical'' virial mass determined by the structure of LCDM halos and the thermal pressure of UV-heated gas. This critical mass increases from Mcrit{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun at z{\textasciitilde}11\$ to {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}9.7 Msun at z=0, roughly following the average mass growth history of halos in that mass range. This implies that most halos above or below critical at present have remained so since early times. In particular, the halos of most galaxies today were already above-critical (and thus forming stars) at high redshift, providing a simple explanation for the ubiquitous presence of ancient stellar populations in dwarfs, regardless of luminosity. It also implies that Mcrit today represents a ``threshold'' mass below which the fraction of ``dark'' halos increases steeply. Sub-critical halos may still host luminous galaxies if they were above-critical at some point in the past. SF ceases if a halo falls into the sub-critical regime; depending on each halo's accretion history this can occur over a wide range of times, explaining why SF in many dwarfs seems to continue well past the reionization epoch. It also suggests a tantalizing explanation for the episodic nature of SF in some dwarfs, which, in this interpretation, would be linked to temporary halo excursions above and below the critical boundary. In the simulations, Mcrit(z) cleanly separates star-forming from non-star-forming systems at all redshifts, indicating that the ionizing UV background, and not stellar feedback, is what regulates the beginning and the end of SF in the faintest dwarfs. Galaxies in sub-critical halos should make up a sizable population of faint field dwarfs, distinct from those in more massive halos because of their lack of ongoing star formation. Although few such galaxies are known at present, the discovery of this population would provide strong support for our results.},

In this review we discuss in a unified manner many existing signals in cosmological and astrophysical data that appear to be in some tension (2 {$\sigma$} or larger) with the standard {$\Lambda$}CDM model as specified by the Cosmological Principle, General Relativity and the Planck18 parameter values. In addition to the well-studied 5 {$\sigma$} challenge of {$\Lambda$}CDM (the Hubble H0 tension) and other well known tensions (the growth tension, and the lensing amplitude AL anomaly), we discuss a wide range of other less discussed less-standard signals which appear at a lower statistical significance level than the H0 tension some of them known as 'curiosities' in the data) which may also constitute hints towards new physics. For example such signals include cosmic dipoles (the fine structure constant {$\alpha$}, velocity and quasar dipoles), CMB asymmetries, BAO Ly {$\alpha$} tension, age of the Universe issues, the Lithium problem, small scale curiosities like the core-cusp and missing satellite problems, quasars Hubble diagram, oscillating short range gravity signals etc. The goal of this pedagogical review is to collectively present the current status (2022 update) of these signals and their level of significance, with emphasis on the Hubble tension and refer to recent resources where more details can be found for each signal. We also briefly discuss theoretical approaches that can potentially explain some of these signals.},

We show first that by going to Hill's limit of vanishing masses, one can reduce the problem to a simpler form in which only one dimensionless parameter remains: the reduced impact parameter. We present then a detailed study of the family obtained when this parameter is varied. Each orbit consists of three phases: approach of the two small bodies, interplay, and departure. Fourth-order series are used to represent the asymptotic motion of the two small bodies in the approach and departure phases; these series are matched with a numerical integration of the interplay phase to give an accurate representation of the entire orbit. For each orbit, we compute the net effect of the encounter, essentially characterized by an increase of the separation of the satellite orbits. We compute also the minimal distance of approach of the two satellites. In the limiting cases of large and small impact parameters, the results are compared with the predictions of perturbation theories. Finally we study the ``transitions,'' which are apparent discontinuities of the family with a sudden change of the direction of departure. We show that they can be explained by the asymptotic approach of the orbit to an unstable periodic solution of Hill's problem. Transitions take place for infinitely many values of the parameter, forming a Cantor-like set.},

In particular, equations are derived for the 'sliding phase', where the two particles slide for a while on each other. The average energies transferred into radial motion and lost in inelastic collisions are calculated for various values of the physical parameters, and with gravitation and collisions taken alone or in combination.

We model the chaotic scattering by a simple billiard: a point particle bounces on two disks and in addition is subjected to a constant acceleration. This leads to a one-parameter family with chaotic scattering. With the help of symbolic dynamics, the structure of the family can be completely elucidated.},

Gravitational lensing by a foreground cluster boosts the flux from MS 1512-cB58 by a factor of {\textasciitilde}30 and provides the opportunity for a first quantitative study of the physical properties of star-forming galaxies at high redshift. The spectrum we have recorded is very rich in stellar and interstellar features; from our analysis of them, we deduce the following main results. The ultraviolet spectral properties of MS 1512-cB58 are remarkably similar to those of nearby star-forming galaxies and spectral synthesis models based on libraries of O and B stars can reproduce accurately the fine detail of the integrated stellar spectrum. The P Cygni profiles of C IV and N V are best matched by continuous star formation with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) extending beyond M=50 Msolar--we find no evidence for either a flatter IMF (at the high-mass end) or an IMF deficient in the most massive stars. There are clues in our data that the metallicity of both the stars and the gas is a few times below solar. Our best estimate, ZcB58{\textasciitilde}1/4 Zsolar, is {\textasciitilde}3 times higher than the typical metallicity of damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems at the same redshift, which is consistent with the proposal that the galaxies which dominate the H I absorption cross section are generally forming stars at a slower rate than L* Lyman-break galaxies like MS 1512-cB58. The relative velocities of the stellar lines, interstellar absorption, and H II emission indicate the existence of large-scale outflows in the interstellar medium of MS 1512-cB58, with a bulk outward motion of 200 km s-1 and a mass-loss rate of {\textasciitilde}60 Msolar yr-1, which is roughly comparable to the star formation rate. Such galactic winds seem to be a common feature of starburst galaxies at all redshifts and may well be the mechanism that self-regulates star formation, distributes metals over large volumes, and allows the escape of ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. We suggest further observations of MS 1512-cB58 that would provide more precise measurements of element abundances and of detailed physical parameters and highlight the need to identify other examples of gravitationally lensed galaxies for a comprehensive study of star formation at early times.

  abstract = {This article presents a measurement of the proper motion of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy determined from images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in two distinct fields. Each field contains a quasi-stellar object that serves as the ``reference point.'' The measured proper motion for Ursa Minor, expressed in the equatorial coordinate system, is ({$\mu\alpha$},{$\mu\delta$})=(-50+/-17,22+/-16) mas century-1. Removing the contributions of the solar motion and the motion of the local standard of rest yields the proper motion in the Galactic rest frame: ({$\mu$}Grf{$\alpha$},{$\mu$}Grf{$\delta$})=(-8+/-17,38+/-16) mas century-1. The implied space velocity with respect to the Galactic center has a radial component of Vr=-75+/-44 km s-1 and a tangential component of Vt=144+/-50 km s-1. Integrating the motion of Ursa Minor in a realistic potential for the Milky Way produces orbital elements. The perigalacticon and apogalacticon are 40 (10, 76) and 89 (78, 160) kpc, respectively, where the values in the parentheses represent the 95\% confidence intervals derived from Monte Carlo experiments. The eccentricity of the orbit is 0.39 (0.09, 0.79), and the orbital period is 1.5 (1.1, 2.7) Gyr. The orbit is retrograde and inclined by 124{$^\circ$} (94{$^\circ$}, 136{$^\circ$}) to the Galactic plane. Ursa Minor is not a likely member of a proposed stream of galaxies on similar orbits around the Milky Way, nor is the plane of its orbit coincident with a recently proposed planar alignment of galaxies around the Milky Way. Comparing the orbits of Ursa Minor and Carina shows no reason for the different star formation histories of these two galaxies. Ursa Minor must contain dark matter to have a high probability of having survived disruption by the Galactic tidal force until the present.

In our simulations the dSph is composed only of luminous matter and falls towards the Milky Way on various orbits and in various galactic potentials starting from apogalacticon. We assume a single perigalacticon passage in which the close encounter with the Milky Way produces strong tides that greatly affect the structure and the kinematics of the dSph. We find that even when tides affect the structure and the kinematics of the dSph, they fail to inflate the central M/L. Tides produce large ordered motions rather than large random motions; a clear signature of these motions is apparent rotation. Tides can inflate the global M/L to a value as large as {\textasciitilde}40; however, this is solely due to the ordered motions. Comparing our results with real dSphs, we conclude that galactic tides at the most recent pericenter passage have not inflated the apparent M/L `s.},

  abstract = {In the era of precision cosmology, it is essential to determine the Hubble constant empirically with an accuracy of one per cent or better1. At present, the uncertainty on this constant is dominated by the uncertainty in the calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity relationship2,3 (also known as the Leavitt law). The Large Magellanic Cloud has traditionally served as the best galaxy with which to calibrate Cepheid period-luminosity relations, and as a result has become the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale4,5. Eclipsing binary systems composed of late-type stars offer the most precise and accurate way to measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Currently the limit of the precision attainable with this technique is about two per cent, and is set by the precision of the existing calibrations of the surface brightness-colour relation5,6. Here we report a calibration of the surface brightness-colour relation with a precision of 0.8 per cent. We use this calibration to determine a geometrical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to 1 per cent based on 20 eclipsing binary systems. The final distance is 49.59 {\textpm} 0.09 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.54 (systematic) kiloparsecs.},

The clear understanding of their production is a fundamental challenge for nuclear astrophysics. The  {$p$} {$p$} -nuclei constrain the nucleosynthesis in core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae. The  {$\gamma$} {$\gamma$} -process is the most established scenario for the production of the  {$p$} {$p$} -nuclei, which are produced via different photodisintegration paths starting on heavier nuclei. A large effort from nuclear physics is needed to access the relevant nuclear reaction rates far from the valley of stability.

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) becomes very popular tool in hydrology, especially in rainfall--runoff modelling. However, a number of issues should be addressed to apply this technique to a particular problem in an efficient way, including selection of network type, its architecture, proper optimization algorithm and a method to deal with overfitting of the data. The present paper addresses the last, rarely considered issue, namely comparison of methods to prevent multi-layer perceptron neural networks from overfitting of the training data in the case of daily catchment runoff modelling. Among a number of methods to avoid overfitting the early stopping, the noise injection and the weight decay have been known for about two decades, however only the first one is frequently applied in practice. Recently a new methodology called optimized approximation algorithm has been proposed in the literature. Overfitting of the training data leads to deterioration of generalization properties of the model and results in its untrustworthy performance when applied to novel measurements. Hence the purpose of the methods to avoid overfitting is somehow contradictory to the goal of optimization algorithms, which aims at finding the best possible solution in parameter space according to pre-defined objective function and available data. Moreover, different optimization algorithms may perform better for simpler or larger ANN architectures. This suggest the importance of proper coupling of different optimization algorithms, ANN architectures and methods to avoid overfitting of real-world data -- an issue that is also studied in details in the present paper. The study is performed for Annapolis River catchment, characterized by significant seasonal changes in runoff, rapid floods during winter and spring, moderately dry summers, severe winters with snowfall, snow melting, frequent freeze and thaw, and presence of river ice. The present paper shows that the elaborated noise injection method may prevent overfitting slightly better than the most popular early stopping approach. However, the implementation of noise injection to real-world problems is difficult and the final model performance depends significantly on a number of very technical details, what somehow limits its practical applicability. It is shown that optimized approximation algorithm does not improve the results obtained by older methods, possibly due to over-simplified criterion of stopping the algorithm. Extensive calculations reveal that Evolutionary Computation-based algorithm performs better for simpler ANN architectures, whereas classical gradient-based Levenberg--Marquardt algorithm is able to benefit from additional input variables, representing precipitation and snow cover from one more previous day, and from more complicated ANN architectures. This confirms that the curse of dimensionality has severe impact on the performance of Evolutionary Computing methods.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5{$\sigma$} level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {$\Lambda$}CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density {\textohm}ch2 = 0.120 {\textpm} 0.001, baryon density {\textohm}bh2 = 0.0224 {\textpm} 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 {\textpm} 0.004, and optical depth {$\tau$} = 0.054 {\textpm} 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100{\texttheta}* = 1.0411 {\textpm} 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 {\textpm} 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter {\textohm}m = 0.315 {\textpm} 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude {$\sigma$}8 = 0.811 {\textpm} 0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 {\textpm} 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to {$\sum$}m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base {$\Lambda$}CDM at over 2{$\sigma$}, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the {$\Lambda$}CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, {\textohm}K = 0.001 {\textpm} 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 {\textpm} 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {$<$} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-{$\Lambda$}CDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6{$\sigma$}, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) driven by galactic tides. We adopt a cosmologically motivated model where dSphs are approximated by a King model embedded within an NFW halo. We find that these NFW-embedded King models are extraordinarily resilient to tides; the stellar density profile still resembles a King model even after losing more than 99\% of the stars. As tides strip the galaxy, the stellar luminosity, velocity dispersion, central surface brightness, and core radius decrease monotonically. Remarkably, we find that the evolution of these parameters is solely controlled by the total amount of mass lost from within the luminous radius. Of all parameters, the core radius is the least affected: after losing 99\% of the stars, Rc decreases by just a factor of {\textasciitilde}2. Interestingly, tides tend to make dSphs more dark matter-dominated because the tightly bound central dark matter "cusp" is more resilient to disruption than the "cored" King profile. We examine whether the extremely large mass-to-light ratios of the newly discovered ultrafaint dSphs might have been caused by tidal stripping of once-brighter systems. Although dSph tidal evolutionary tracks parallel the observed scaling relations in the luminosity-radius plane, they predict too steep a change in velocity dispersion compared with the observational estimates hitherto reported in the literature. The ultrafaint dwarfs are thus unlikely to be the tidal remnants of systems like Fornax, Draco, or Sagittarius. Despite spanning four decades in luminosity, dSphs appear to inhabit halos of comparable peak circular velocity, lending support to scenarios that envision dSphs as able to form only in halos above a certain mass threshold.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive set of convergence tests which explore the role of various numerical parameters on the equilibrium structure of a simulated dark matter halo. We report on results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art, multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the gravitational softening, time-step, force accuracy, initial redshift, and particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the time-step is much shorter than the local orbital time-scale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation time-scale is longer than the age of the Universe. Convergence also requires sufficiently high initial redshift and accurate force computations. Poor spatial, time, or force resolution leads generally to systems with artificially low central density, but may also result in the formation of artificially dense central cusps. We have explored several adaptive time-stepping choices and we have obtained the best results when individual time-steps are chosen according to the local acceleration and the gravitational softening ({$\Delta$}ti{\textasciitilde} ({$\varepsilon$}/ai)1/2), although further experimentation may yield better and more efficient criteria. The most stringent requirement for convergence is typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation criterion. This implies that, in order to estimate accurate circular velocities at radii where the density contrast may reach {\textasciitilde}106, the region must enclose of the order of 3000 particles (or more than a few times 106 within the virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized {$\Lambda$}CDM halo, we find that the spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope shallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, {\textasciitilde}0.005 r200, with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner regions.},

This textbook for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students aims to develop a broad physical understanding of the fundamental principles that dictate stellar properties. The study of stellar evolution focuses on the 'life cycle' of stars: how they are born, how they live, and how they die. As elements ejected by one generation of stars are incorporated into the next generation, stellar evolution is intertwined with the chemical evolution of our galaxy. Focusing on key physical processes without going into encyclopedic depth, the authors present stellar evolution in a contemporary context, including phenomena such as pulsations, mass loss, binary interactions, and rotation, which contribute to our understanding of stars.},

  abstract = {We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a "gas" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes "self-similar" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can "bootstrap" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal "seed" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give only very broad limits, unfortunately.

We adopt central velocity dispersions of 9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Draco and 11 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Ursa Minor. Then, for an isotropic stellar velocity distribution, the central DM densities are {$\rho\_$}0D\_ = 0.8 and 1.0 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}, respectively, if visible and dark matter have the same core radius. If DM has a much larger core radius than visible matter but nevertheless dominates the potential, these densities are reduced by a factor of 2. Central DM densities can be lower than this only if the stellar velocity distribution is anisotropic. We use simple two-component King models to investigate this and to look for the smallest DM densities that are consistent with the observations. In both galaxies we show that {$\rho$}0D{$>$}=0.05 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}. These lower limits are model independent except for the assumption of spherical symmetry. Relaxing this remaining assumption is unlikely to alter the limits. Models with central visible matter densities as large as those of DM are probably just acceptable. In Draco, either the core radii of the luminous and dark matter are similar, or the luminous matter has an anisotropic velocity dispersion, or its dispersion increases with radius.},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies might be destroyed either by internal processes, such as gas loss induced by star formation, or external processes, such as tidal disruption. It is hard to see how gas loss or stellar mass loss can disrupt a galaxy dominated by dark matter. Recent modeling of the tidal destruction of dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the Milky Way has concentrated on what the dwarf would look like during the destruction. A velocity gradient across the galaxy that is larger than the velocity dispersion is the clearest signature. The lack of such gradients in all of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies except Sagittarius means that these galaxies are not being significantly affected by tides and that tides cannot explain their large measured mass-to-light ratios. Sagittarius probably is being destroyed by tides today and models of tidal destruction are being applied to interpret the observations of this galaxy.},

Cross matching with publicly available catalogues of RR Lyrae, we find one RR Lyrae candidate with \$\{\}50\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ astrometric probability outside the limiting radius in each of Sculptor and Fornax, two such candidates in Draco, nine in Ursa Minor, seven in Sextans, and zero in Carina.

  abstract = {The Gaia mission has provided an invaluable wealth of astrometric data for more than a billion stars in our Galaxy. The synergy between Gaia astrometry, photometry, and spectroscopic surveys gives us comprehensive information about the Milky Way. Using the Bayesian isochrone-fitting code StarHorse, we derive distances and extinctions for more than 10 million unique stars listed in both Gaia Data Release 3 and public spectroscopic surveys: 557 559 in GALAH+ DR3, 4 531 028 in LAMOST DR7 LRS, 347 535 in LAMOST DR7 MRS, 562 424 in APOGEE DR17, 471 490 in RAVE DR6, 249 991 in SDSS DR12 (optical spectra from BOSS and SEGUE), 67 562 in the Gaia-ESO DR5 survey, and 4 211 087 in the Gaia RVS part of the Gaia DR3 release. StarHorse can increase the precision of distance and extinction measurements where Gaia parallaxes alone would be uncertain. We used StarHorse for the first time to derive stellar ages for main-sequence turnoff and subgiant branch stars, around 2.5 million stars, with age uncertainties typically around 30\%; the uncertainties drop to 15\% for subgiant-branch-only stars, depending on the resolution of the survey. With the derived ages in hand, we investigated the chemical-age relations. In particular, the {$\alpha$} and neutron-capture element ratios versus age in the solar neighbourhood show trends similar to previous works, validating our ages. We used the chemical abundances from local subgiant samples of GALAH DR3, APOGEE DR17, and LAMOST MRS DR7 to map groups with similar chemical compositions and StarHorse ages, using the dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE and the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN. We identify three distinct groups in all three samples, confirmed by their kinematic properties: the genuine chemical thick disk, the thin disk, and a considerable number of young alpha-rich stars (427) that are also a part of the delivered catalogues. We confirm that the genuine thick disk's kinematics and age properties are radically different from those of the thin disk and compatible with high-redshift (z {$\approx$} 2) star-forming disks with high dispersion velocities. We also find a few extra chemical populations in GALAH DR3 thanks to the availability of neutron-capture element information.

  abstract = {We derive new, accurate radial velocity (V\_r\_) measurements for 23 Sculptor K-giant stars from high-resolution echelle spectra made with the ESO NTT and 3.6-m telescopes. Comparing our velocities with previous measurements (Armandroff \& Da Costa 1986) for 15 stars, we show that the V\_r\_ measurements are reliable, and discover two V\_r\_ variable stars with large amplitudes ({$>$}17km/s). These variations are best explained by binary orbital motions. As our sample is likely to contain many additional undetected binaries with smaller velocity amplitudes (due to less favorable orbit inclinations, smaller mass ratios, or longer periods), the observations suggest a large binary fraction in Sculptor, possibly larger than {\textasciitilde}20\% within the period limits {\textasciitilde}0.5 to {\textasciitilde}20yrs. This result is consistent with the recent discoveries of 2-3 large-amplitude variable stars in Ursa Minor and Sextant. Previous kinematic studies of dSph galaxies based on single-epoch measurements are consequently not fully reliable. Radial velocity-variable stars artificially inflate the velocity dispersion and the mass-to-light (M/L) ratio estimates. This weakens the case for dark matter, at least in some of the dSph galaxies. In the case of Sculptor, a velocity dispersion of 6.2+/-1.1km/s and a M/L ratio of 13+/-6(M/L\_V\_)sun\_ are derived from our sample. These results do not provide unambiguous evidence for a dominant dark matter component in Sculptor, mainly because our sample is likely to contain additional undetected V\_r\_ variables of lower amplitude.},

  abstract = {Context. Ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are expected to be relics of the earliest galaxies to have formed in the Universe. Observations show the presence of a stellar halo around UFDs, which can give precious insights into UFD evolution. Indeed, stellar halos can form via tidal interaction, early supernova feedback, or merging events. Aims. This work investigates how merger properties impact the formation of stellar halos around UFDs, focusing on Tucana II, the most promising UFD assembled through mergers. Methods. We developed N-body simulations of dry isolated mergers between two UFDs, resolving their stellar component down to 1 M{$\odot$}. We built a suite of simulations by varying: the merger-specific i) angular momentum, l, and ii) kinetic energy k, iii) the merger mass ratio, M1/M2, iv) the dark-to-stellar mass ratio, MDM/M{$\star$}, of the progenitors, and v) their stellar size, R1/2. To fully explore such a five-dimensional parameter space, we trained a neural network to emulate the properties of the resulting "post-merger" UFD, by quantifying the half-mass radius (R{$\star$}) and the fraction of stars at radii {$>$} 5R{$\star$} (f5). Results. Our principal component analysis clearly shows that f5 (R{$\star$}) is primarily determined by M1/M2 (R1/2), with R1/2 (M1/M2) playing a secondary role. Both f5 and R{$\star$} show almost no dependence on k, l, and MDM/M{$\star$} in the explored range. Using our emulator, we find that to form the stellar halo observed in Tucana II; that is, f5 = 10 {\textpm} 5\% and R{$\star$} = 120 {\textpm} 30 pc, we need to merge progenitors with M1/M2 = 8-3+4, the size of the more massive one being R1/2 = 97-18+25 pc. Such findings are corroborated by the consistency ({$\chi$}2 {$\simeq$} 0.5 - 2) between stellar density profiles observed for Tucana II and those of simulations that have M1/M2 and R1/2 close to the values predicted by the emulator. Conclusions. The stellar halos of UFDs contain crucial information about the properties of their smaller progenitor galaxies. Ongoing and planned spectroscopic surveys will greatly increase the statistics of observed stars in UFDs, and thus of their associated stellar halos. By interpreting such observations with our simulations, we will provide new insights into the assembly history of UFDs, and thus the early galaxy formation process.},

Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can tackle or alleviate small-scale issues within the cosmological standard model {$\Lambda$}CDM, and diverse flavours of SIDM can produce unique astrophysical predictions, resulting in different possible signatures which can be used to test these models with dedicated observations of galaxy clusters. Aims: This work aims to assess the impact of dark matter self-interactions on the properties of galaxy clusters. In particular, the goal is to study the angular dependence of the cross section by testing rare (large angle scattering) and frequent (small angle scattering) SIDM models with velocity-dependent cross sections. Methods: We re-simulated six galaxy cluster zoom-in initial conditions with a dark matter-only run and with full-physics set-up simulations that include a self-consistent treatment of baryon physics. We tested the dark matter-only setup and the full physics setup with the collisionless cold dark matter, rare self-interacting dark matter, and frequent self-interacting dark matter models. We then studied their matter density profiles as well as their subhalo population. Results: Our dark matter-only SIDM simulations agree with theoretical models, and when baryons are included in simulations, our SIDM models substantially increase the central density of galaxy cluster cores compared to full-physics simulations using collisionless dark matter. SIDM subhalo suppression in full-physics simulations is milder compared to the one found in the dark matter-only simulations because of the cuspier baryonic potential that prevents subhalo disruption. Moreover, SIDM with small-angle scattering significantly suppresses a larger number of subhaloes compared to large-angle scattering SIDM models. Additionally, SIDM models generate a broader range of subhalo concentration values, including a tail of more diffuse subhaloes in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and a population of more compact subhaloes in the cluster cores.},

  abstract = {Context. In the last 15 years different ground-based spectroscopic surveys have been started (and completed) with the general aim of delivering stellar parameters and elemental abundances for large samples of Galactic stars, complementing Gaia astrometry. Among those surveys, the Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey, the only one performed on a 8m class telescope, was designed to target 100 000 stars using FLAMES on the ESO VLT (both Giraffe and UVES spectrographs), covering all the Milky Way populations, with a special focus on open star clusters. Aims: This article provides an overview of the survey implementation (observations, data quality, analysis and its success, data products, and releases), of the open cluster survey, of the science results and potential, and of the survey legacy. A companion article reviews the overall survey motivation, strategy, Giraffe pipeline data reduction, organisation, and workflow. Methods: We made use of the information recorded and archived in the observing blocks; during the observing runs; in a number of relevant documents; in the spectra and master catalogue of spectra; in the parameters delivered by the analysis nodes and the working groups; in the final catalogue; and in the science papers. Based on these sources, we critically analyse and discuss the output and products of the Survey, including science highlights. We also determined the average metallicities of the open clusters observed as science targets and of a sample of clusters whose spectra were retrieved from the ESO archive. Results: The Gaia-ESO Survey has determined homogeneous good-quality radial velocities and stellar parameters for a large fraction of its more than 110 000 unique target stars. Elemental abundances were derived for up to 31 elements for targets observed with UVES. Lithium abundances are delivered for about 1/3 of the sample. The analysis and homogenisation strategies have proven to be successful; several science topics have been addressed by the Gaia-ESO consortium and the community, with many highlight results achieved. Conclusions: The final catalogue will be released through the ESO archive in the first half of 2022, including the complete set of advanced data products. In addition to these results, the Gaia-ESO Survey will leave a very important legacy, for several aspects and for many years to come.

  abstract = {There are two main tidal effects that can act on the Local Group dwarf spheroidals (dSphs): tidal stripping and tidal shocking. Using N-body simulations, we show that tidal stripping always leads to flat or rising projected velocity dispersions beyond a critical radius; it is {\textasciitilde}5 times more likely, when averaging over all possible projection angles, that the cylindrically averaged projected dispersion will rise, rather than be flat. In contrast, the Local Group dSphs, as a class, show flat or falling projected velocity dispersions interior to {\textasciitilde}1kpc. This argues for tidal stripping being unimportant interior to {\textasciitilde}1kpc for most of the Local Group dSphs observed so far. We show that tidal shocking may still be important, however, even when tidal stripping is not. This could explain the observed correlation for the Local Group dSphs between central surface brightness and distance from the nearest large galaxy. These results have important implications for the formation of the dSphs and for cosmology. As a result of the existence of cold stars at large radii in several dSphs, a tidal origin for the formation of these Local Group dSphs (in which they contain no dark matter) is strongly disfavoured. In the cosmological context, a naive solution to the missing satellites problem is to allow only the most massive substructure dark matter haloes around the Milky Way to form stars. It is possible for dSphs to reside within these haloes ({\textasciitilde}1010Msolar) and have their velocity dispersions lowered through the action of tidal shocks, but only if they have a central density core in their dark matter, rather than a cusp. A central density cusp persists even after unrealistically extreme tidal shocking and leads to central velocity dispersions which are too high to be consistent with data from the Local Group dSphs. dSphs can reside within cuspy dark matter haloes if their haloes are less massive ({\textasciitilde}109Msolar) and therefore have smaller central velocity dispersions initially.},

Through N-body simulations and analytic calculations we investigate the extent to which these properties can be generated from `typical'{$\Lambda$}CDM galaxies, which differ in all of these properties, by the dynamical consequences of feedback.We find that, for a wide range of initial conditions, one impulsive mass-loss event will naturally produce a surface brightness profile in the remaining stellar component of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) which is well-fitted over many scalelengths by an exponential, in good qualitative agreement with observations of Local Group dSphs. Furthermore, two impulsive mass-loss phases, punctuated by significant gas re-accretion, are found to be sufficient to transform a central density cusp in the dark matter profile into a near-constant density core. This may then provide the missing link between current cosmological simulations, which predict a central cusp in the dark matter density profile, and current observations, which find much shallower central density profiles.We also look at the angular momentum history of dSphs and demonstrate that if these galaxies have spent most of their lifetime in tidal isolation from massive galaxies then they cannot have formed from high angular momentum gas discs.},

These haloes are just massive enough to efficiently form stars through atomic line cooling and to hold on to their gas in the presence of supernova (SN) winds and reionization. These combined effects, in particular that of the SN feedback, create a sharp transition: over the mass range 3-10 {\texttimes} 107Msolar, the BBBs drop two orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Below {\textasciitilde}2 {\texttimes} 107Msolar, galaxies will be dark with almost no stars and no gas. Above this scale is the smallest unit of galaxy formation: the BBB. We show that the BBBs have stellar distributions which are spheroidal, of low rotational velocity, old and metal poor: they resemble the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group (LG). Unlike the LG dSphs, however, they contain significant gas fractions. We connect these high-redshift BBBs to the smallest dwarf galaxies observed at z = 0 using linear theory. A small fraction ({\textasciitilde}100) of these gas-rich BBBs at high redshift fall in to a galaxy the size of the Milky Way (MW). We suggest that 10 per cent of these survive to become the observed LG dwarf galaxies at the present epoch. This is consistent with recent numerical estimates. Those infalling haloes on benign orbits which keep them far away from the MW or Andromeda manage to retain their gas and slowly form stars - these become the smallest dwarf irregular galaxies; those on more severe orbits lose their gas faster than they can form stars and become the dwarf spheroidals. The remaining 90 per cent of the BBBs will be accreted. We show that this gives a metallicity and total stellar mass consistent with the MW old stellar halo.},

We find that two populations provide an excellent recovery of {$\rho$}(r) in-between their respective R1/2. However, even with a total of {$\sim$}7000 tracers, we are not able to well-constrain {$\beta$}(r) for either population. By contrast, using 1000 tracers with higher order VSPs we are able to measure {$\rho$}(r) over the range 0.5 {$<$} r/R1/2 {$<$} 2 and broadly constrain {$\beta$}(r). Including proper motion data for all stars gives an even better performance, with {$\rho$} and {$\beta$} well-measured over the range 0.25 {$<$} r/R1/2 {$<$} 4. Finally, we test GravSphere on a triaxial mock galaxy that has axis ratios typical of a merger remnant [1 : 0.8 : 0.6]. In this case, GravSphere can become slightly biased. However, we find that when this occurs the data are poorly fit, allowing us to detect when such departures from spherical symmetry become problematic.},

  abstract = {Context. The chemo-physical parametrisation of stellar spectra is essential for understanding the nature and evolution of stars and of Galactic stellar populations. A worldwide observational effort from the ground has provided, in one century, an extremely heterogeneous collection of chemical abundances for about two million stars in total, with fragmentary sky coverage. Aims: This situation is revolutionised by the Gaia third data release (DR3), which contains the parametrisation of Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) data performed by the General Stellar Parametriser-spectroscopy, GSP-Spec, module. Here we describe the parametrisation of the first 34 months of Gaia RVS observations. Methods: GSP-Spec estimates the chemo-physical parameters from combined RVS spectra of single stars, without additional inputs from astrometric, photometric, or spectro-photometric BP/RP data. The main analysis workflow described here, MatisseGauguin, is based on projection and optimisation methods and provides the stellar atmospheric parameters; the individual chemical abundances of N, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe I, Fe II, Ni, Zr, Ce and Nd; the differential equivalent width of a cyanogen line; and the parameters of a diffuse interstellar band (DIB) feature. Another workflow, based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and referred to with the same acronym, provides a second set of atmospheric parameters that are useful for classification control. For both workflows, we implement a detailed quality flag chain considering different error sources. Results: With about 5.6 million stars, the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec all-sky catalogue is the largest compilation of stellar chemo-physical parameters ever published and the first one from space data. Internal and external biases have been studied taking into account the implemented flags. In some cases, simple calibrations with low degree polynomials are suggested. The homogeneity and quality of the estimated parameters enables chemo-dynamical studies of Galactic stellar populations, interstellar extinction studies from individual spectra, and clear constraints on stellar evolution models. We highly recommend that users adopt the provided quality flags for scientific exploitation. Conclusions: The Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalogue is a major step in the scientific exploration of Milky Way stellar populations. It will be followed by increasingly large and higher quality catalogues in future data releases, confirming the Gaia promise of a new Galactic vision.},

The duration of the Roche lobe overflow phase is resolution dependent and would lengthen with increased resolution beyond the {$\sim$}20~yr observed, while the inspiral phase and the post-common envelope separation are largely independent of (average) resolution. Mass transfer rates through the Lagrangian points drive the orbital evolution during the Roche lobe overflow phase, as predicted analytically. The absolute mass transfer rate is resolution dependent, but always within a factor of two of the analytical value. Similarly, the gravitational drag in the simulations is close to the analytical approximation. This verifies simulations and shows that these analytical approximations are reasonable. The L2 and L3 outflows observed during Roche lobe overflow remain bound, forming a circumbinary disc that is largely disrupted by the common envelope ejection. However, a longer phase of Roche lobe overflow and weaker common envelope ejection typical of a more stable Roche lobe phase may result in a surviving circumbinary disc. Finally, we examine the density distribution resulting from the interaction for simulations that include or omit the phase of Roche lobe overflow. We conclude that the degree of stability of the Roche lobe phase modulates the shape of the subsequent planetary nebula, explaining the wide range of post-common envelope planetary nebula shapes observed.},

The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy is -0.4+/-0.9 km s-1. A maximum likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within the observed Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that Sgr A* contains more than about 10\% of the {\textasciitilde}4{\texttimes}106 Msolar deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A*, as measured by several investigators, is less than 1 AU, and the implied mass density of {\textasciitilde}1022 Msolar pc-3 is within about 3 orders of magnitude of a comparable supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative source at the center of a galaxy contains of order 106 Msolar and provides overwhelming evidence that it is in the form of a supermassive black hole. Finally, the existence of ``intermediate-mass'' black holes more massive than {\textasciitilde}104 Msolar between roughly 103 and 105 AU from Sgr A* is excluded.},

Out of an original (3.4 Mpc/h)3 cosmological box, a sample of 27 systems are re-simulated from z = 70 to z = 0 using a zoom-in technique. Gas and stellar properties are confronted to the observations in the greatest details: in addition to the galaxy global properties, we investigated the model galaxy velocity dispersion profiles, half-light radii, star formation histories, stellar metallicity distributions, and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios. The formation and sustainability of the metallicity gradients and kinematically distinct stellar populations are also tackled. We show how the properties of six Local Group dwarf galaxies, NGC 6622, Andromeda II, Sculptor, Sextans, Ursa Minor and Draco are reproduced, and how they pertain to three main galaxy build-up modes. Our results indicate that the interaction with a massive central galaxy could be needed for a handful of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies only, the vast majority of the systems and their variety of star formation histories arising naturally from a {$\Lambda$}CDM framework. We find that models fitting well the local Group dwarf galaxies are embedded in dark haloes of mass between 5 {\texttimes} 108 to a few 109 M{$\odot$}, without any missing satellite problem. We confirm the failure of the abundance matching approach at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies. Some of the observed faint however gas-rich galaxies with residual star formation, such as Leo T and Leo P, remain challenging. They point out the need of a better understanding of the UV-background heating.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for studying tracers in gravitational systems where higher moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution are introduced via Virial equations rather than the Jeans equations. Unlike the fourth-order Jeans equations, the fourth-order Virial equations can simply be added to the standard second-order Jeans equation without introducing a new anisotropy parameter {$\beta$}'. We introduce two new global shape parameters {$\zeta$}A and {$\zeta$}B which replace the kurtosis as a more statistically robust measure of the shape of the line-of-sight velocity distribution. We show that in the case of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies these new parameters can significantly reduce the range of density profiles that are otherwise consistent with the observed stellar kinematics (a problem sometimes known as the {$\beta$} degeneracy). Specifically, we find that {$\zeta$}A focuses tightly on a sub-set of solutions where cusped density profiles are degenerate with more concentrated cored dark matter haloes. If the number density of stars {$\nu$}(r) is fixed, then introducing {$\zeta$}B can further reduce the space of solutions by constraining the outer slope of the dark matter density profile. Assuming a Plummer profile for {$\nu$}(r), we recover the surprising result that the dark matter in Sculptor may be cuspy after all, in contrast to the conclusions of other approaches.},

Fossil galaxies are even smaller mass dwarf galaxies that stopped forming stars after the epoch of reionization and have been identified in the Local Group as the ultrafaint dwarf satellites. Using cosmological N-body simulations, we present an empirical model for the shape and mass of ghostly stellar haloes. We compare the model to available observations of stellar haloes in six isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (Leo T, Leo A, IC 10, WLM, IC 1613, NGC 6822) to infer the star formation efficiency in dwarf galaxies at the epoch of reionization. We find an efficiency of star formation in dark matter haloes with masses 106-108 M{$\odot$} at z {\textasciitilde} 7 in rough agreement with independent methods using data on the luminosity function of ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but systematically higher by a factor of 3-5. The systematic uncertainty of our results is still large, mainly because available observations of stellar halo profiles do not extend over a sufficiently large distance from the centre of the host dwarf galaxy. Additional observations, easily within reach of current telescopes, can significantly improve the accuracy of this method and can also be used to constrain the present-day dark matter masses of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Our method is based on a set of observations never used before; hence, it is a new independent test of models of hierarchical galaxy formation.},

In particular, the treatment of the BP and RP background has been updated to include a better estimation of the local background, and the detection of crowding effects has been used to exclude affected data from the calibrations. The photometric calibration models have also been updated to account for flux loss over the whole magnitude range. Significant improvements in the modelling and calibration of the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} point and line spread functions have also helped to reduce a number of instrumental effects that were still present in DR2. \emph{Results.

Observationally, the abundance can be measured using absorbing clouds along the lines of sight to distant quasars.

This particular measurement is of interest because it is amongst the most precise assessments to date and it has been derived from the second lowest column-density absorber [N(H I) = 17.9 cm-2] that has so-far been utilized for deuterium abundance measurements. The majority of existing high-precision measurements were obtained from considerably higher column density systems [I.e. N(H I) {$>$} 19.4 cm-2].

  abstract = {We stack the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of N = 14 highly magnified gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshifts 1.6{$<$} z{$<$} 3.6. The resulting new composite spans 900{$<$} \{{$\lambda$} \}\{rest\}{$<$} 3000 {\AA}, with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 103 per spectral resolution element ({$\sim$}100 km s-1). It is the highest S/N, highest spectral resolution composite spectrum of z {$\sim$} 2-3 galaxies yet published. The composite reveals numerous weak nebular emission lines and stellar photospheric absorption lines that can serve as new physical diagnostics, particularly at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We report equivalent widths to aid in proposing for and interpreting JWST spectra. We examine the velocity profiles of strong absorption features in the composite, and in a matched composite of z{$\sim$} 0 COS/HST galaxy spectra. We find remarkable similarity in the velocity profiles at z{$\sim$} 0 and z{$\sim$} 2, suggesting that similar physical processes control the outflows across cosmic time. While the maximum outflow velocity depends strongly on ionization potential, the absorption-weighted mean velocity does not. As such, the bulk of the high-ionization absorption traces the low-ionization gas, with an additional blueshifted absorption tail extending to at least -2000 km s-1. We interpret this tail as arising from the stellar wind and photospheres of massive stars. Starburst99 models are able to replicate this high-velocity absorption tail. However, these theoretical models poorly reproduce several of the photospheric absorption features, indicating that improvements are needed to match observational constraints on the massive stellar content of star-forming galaxies at z{$\sim$} 2. We publicly release our composite spectra.},

We also analyze near-IR spectra from Gemini that cover H{$\alpha$} for a portion of the lensed arc. We report fluxes for 42 detected emission lines, and upper limits for an additional 22. This galaxy has extreme emission-line ratios and high equivalent widths that are characteristic of extreme emission-line galaxies. We compute strong emission-line diagnostics from both the rest-frame optical and rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), to constrain physical conditions and test the spectral diagnostics themselves. We tightly determine the nebular physical conditions using the most reliable diagnostics, and then compare to results from other diagnostics. We find disappointing performance from the UV-only diagnostics: they either are unable to measure the metallicity or dramatically underestimate it; they overestimate the pressure; and the UV diagnostic of ionization parameter has a strong metallicity dependence in this regime. Based on these results, we suggest that upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectroscopic surveys of galaxies in the reionization epoch should invest the additional integration time to capture the optical [O II] and [O III] emission lines, and not rely solely on the rest-frame UV emission lines. We make available the spectra; they represent one of the highest-quality emission-line spectral atlases of star-forming galaxies available beyond the local universe, and will aid the planning of observations with JWST.},

The anisotropy profile for the MW satellite system increases from {$\beta$} {$\sim$} -2 at r {$\sim$} 20 kpc to {$\beta$} {$\sim$} 0.5 at r {$\sim$} 200 kpc, indicating that satellites closer to the Galactic centre have tangentially biased motions while those farther out have radially biased motions. The motions of satellites around APOSTLE host galaxies are nearly isotropic at all radii, while the {$\beta$}(r) profiles for satellite systems in the Auriga suite, whose host galaxies are substantially more massive in baryons than those in APOSTLE, are more consistent with that of the MW satellite system. This shape of the {$\beta$}(r) profile may be attributed to the central stellar disc preferentially destroying satellites on radial orbits, or intrinsic processes from the formation of the MW system.},

  abstract = {In a hierarchically formed Universe, galaxies accrete smaller systems that tidally disrupt as they evolve in the host's potential. We present a complete catalogue of disrupting galaxies accreted onto Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. We classify accretion events as intact satellites, stellar streams, or phase-mixed systems based on automated criteria calibrated to a visually classified sample, and match accretions to their counterparts in haloes re-simulated at higher resolution. Most satellites with a bound progenitor at the present day have lost substantial amounts of stellar mass -- 67 per cent have \$f\_{\textbackslash}text\{bound\} {$<$} 0.97\$ (our threshold to no longer be considered intact), while 53 per cent satisfy a more stringent \$f\_{\textbackslash}text\{bound\} {$<$} 0.8\$. Streams typically outnumber intact systems, contribute a smaller fraction of overall accreted stars, and are substantial contributors at intermediate distances from the host centre (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.1 to \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.7\$R\_{\textbackslash}text\{200m\}\$, or \${\textbackslash}sim\$35 to \${\textbackslash}sim\$250 kpc for the Milky Way). We also identify accretion events that disrupt to form streams around massive intact satellites instead of the main host. Streams are more likely than intact or phase-mixed systems to have experienced preprocessing, suggesting this mechanism is important for setting disruption rates around Milky Way-mass haloes. All of these results are preserved across different simulation resolutions, though we do find some hints that satellites disrupt more readily at lower resolution. The Auriga haloes suggest that disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass galaxies are the norm and that a wealth of tidal features waits to be uncovered in upcoming surveys.},

These models are computed with the MESA stellar evolution code and are evolved up to the AGB, the white dwarf stage, or until core collapse. The nucleosynthesis was calculated for all isotopes in post-processing with the NuGrid MPPNP code. Explosive nucleosynthesis is based on semi-analytic 1D shock models. Metallicity-dependent mass-loss, convective boundary mixing in low- and intermediate-mass models and H and He core burning massive star models are included. Convective O-C shell mergers in some stellar models lead to the strong production of odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc. In AGB models with hot dredge-up, the convective boundary mixing efficiency is reduced to accommodate for its energetic feedback. In both low-mass and massive star models at the lowest metallicity, H-ingestion events are observed and lead to i-process nucleosynthesis and substantial 15N production.

  abstract = {Due to their production sites, as well as to how they are processed and destroyed in stars, the light elements are excellent tools to investigate a number of crucial issues in modern astrophysics: from stellar structure and non-standard processes at work in stellar interiors to age dating of stars; from pre-main sequence evolution to the star formation histories of young clusters and associations and to multiple populations in globular clusters; from Big Bang nucleosynthesis to the formation and chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way Galaxy and its populations, just to cite some relevant examples. In this paper, we focus on lithium, beryllium, and boron (LiBeB) and on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO). LiBeB are rare elements, with negligible abundances with respect to hydrogen; on the contrary, CNO are among the most abundant elements in the Universe, after H and He. Pioneering observations of light-element surface abundances in stars started almost 70~years ago and huge progress has been achieved since then. Indeed, for different reasons, precise measurements of LiBeB and CNO are difficult, even in our Sun; however, the advent of state-of-the-art ground- and space-based instrumentation has allowed the determination of high-quality abundances in stars of different type, belonging to different Galactic populations, from metal-poor halo stars to young stars in the solar vicinity and from massive stars to cool dwarfs and giants. Noticeably, the recent large spectroscopic surveys performed with multifiber spectrographs have yielded detailed and homogeneous information on the abundances of Li and CNO for statistically significant samples of stars; this has allowed us to obtain new results and insights and, at the same time, raise new questions and challenges. A complete understanding of the light-element patterns and evolution in the Universe has not been still achieved. Perspectives for further progress will open up soon thanks to the new generation instrumentation that is under development and will come online in the coming years.},

  abstract = {The surface [C/N] ratios of evolved giants are strongly affected by the first dredge-up (FDU) of nuclear-processed material from stellar cores. C and N also have distinct nucleosynthetic origins and serve as diagnostics of mixing and mass-loss. We use subgiants to find strong trends in the birth [C/N] with [Fe/H], which differ between the low-{$\alpha$} and high-{$\alpha$} populations. We demonstrate that these birth trends have a strong impact on the surface abundances after the FDU. This effect is neglected in current stellar models, which use solar-scaled C and N. We map out the FDU as a function of evolutionary state, mass, and composition using a large and precisely measured asteroseismic data set in first-ascent red giant branch (RGB) and core He-burning, or red clump (RC), stars. We describe the domains where [C/N] is a useful mass diagnostic and find that the RC complements the RGB and extends the range of validity to higher mass. We find evidence for extra mixing on the RGB below [Fe/H] = -0.4, matching literature results, for high-{$\alpha$} giants, but there is no clear evidence of mixing in the low-{$\alpha$} giants. The predicted signal of mass-loss is weak and difficult to detect in our sample. We discuss implications for stellar physics and stellar population applications.},

  abstract = {Context. Accurate astrometry achieved by Gaia for many stars in the Milky Way provides an opportunity to reanalyse the Galactic stellar populations from a large and homogeneous sample and to revisit the Galaxy gravitational potential. Aims: This paper shows how a self-consistent dynamical model can be obtained by fitting the gravitational potential of the Milky Way to the stellar kinematics and densities from Gaia data. Methods: We derived a gravitational potential using the Besancon Galaxy Model, and computed the disc stellar distribution functions based on three integrals of motion (E, Lz, I3) to model stationary stellar discs. The gravitational potential and the stellar distribution functions are built self-consistently, and are then adjusted to be in agreement with the kinematics and the density distributions obtained from Gaia observations. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to fit the free parameters of the dynamical model to Gaia parallax and proper motion distributions. The fit is done on several sets of Gaia data, mainly a subsample of the GCNS (Gaia catalogue of nearby stars to 100 pc) with G {$<$} 17, together with 26 deep fields selected from eDR3, widely spread in longitudes and latitudes. Results: We are able to determine the velocity dispersion ellipsoid and its tilt for subcomponents of different ages, both varying with R and z. The density laws and their radial scale lengths for the thin and thick disc populations are also obtained self-consistently. This new model has some interesting characteristics that come naturally from the process, such as a flaring thin disc. The thick disc is found to present very distinctive characteristics from the old thin disc, both in density and kinematics. This lends significant support to the idea that thin and thick discs were formed in distinct scenarios, as the density and kinematics transition between them is found to be abrupt. The dark matter halo is shown to be nearly spherical. We also derive the solar motion with regards to the Local Standard of Rest (LSR), finding U{$\odot$} = 10.79 {\textpm} 0.56 km s-1, V{$\odot$} = 11.06 {\textpm} 0.94 km s-1, and W{$\odot$} = 7.66 {\textpm} 0.43 km s-1, in close agreement with recent studies. Conclusions: The resulting fully self-consistent gravitational potential, still axisymmetric, is a good approximation of a smooth mass distribution in the Milky Way and can be used for further studies, including finding streams, substructures, and to compute orbits for real stars in our Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Using the phat-ELVIS suite of Milky Way-sized halo simulations, we show that subhalo orbital pericentres, rperi, correlate with their dark matter halo structural properties. Specifically, at fixed maximum circular velocity, Vmax, subhaloes with smaller rperi are more concentrated (have smaller rmax values) and have lost more mass, with larger peak circular velocities, Vpeak, prior to infall. These trends provide information that can tighten constraints on the inferred Vmax and Vpeak values for known Milky Way satellites. We illustrate this using published pericentre estimates enabled by Gaia for the nine classical Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellites. The two densest dSph satellites (Draco and Ursa Minor) have relatively small pericentres, and this pushes their inferred rmax and Vmax values lower than they would have been without pericentre information. For Draco, we infer \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} = 23.5 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}pm 3.3\$ km s-1 (compared to \$27.3 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}pm 7.1\$ km s-1 without pericentre information). Such a shift exacerbates the traditional Too Big to Fail problem. Draco's peak circular velocity range prior to infall narrows from Vpeak = 21-51 km s-1 without pericentre information to Vpeak = 25-37 km s-1 with the constraint. Over the full population of classical dwarf spheroidals, we find no correlation between Vpeak and stellar mass today, indicative of a high level of stochasticity in galaxy formation at stellar masses below {\textasciitilde}107 M{$\odot$}.

Our analysis reveals a large, extended region of stellar substructure surrounding the dwarf, as well as a distinct overdensity encroaching on its tidal radius. A radial profile of the Bo{\"o}tes I stellar distribution shows a break radius indicating the presence of extra-tidal stars. These observations strongly suggest that Bo{\"o}tes I is experiencing tidal disruption, although not as extreme as that exhibited by the Hercules dwarf spheroidal.

  abstract = {The trends of chemical abundances and abundance ratios observed in stars of different ages, kinematics, and metallicities bear the imprints of several physical processes which concur, thus shaping the host galaxy properties. By inspecting these trends, we obtain precious information on stellar nucleosynthesis, the stellar mass spectrum, the timescale of structure formation, the efficiency of star formation, as well as any inward or outward flows of gas. In this paper, we analyse recent determinations of carbon-to-iron and carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratios in different environments (the Milky Way and elliptical galaxies), using our latest chemical evolution models that implement up-to-date stellar yields and rely on the tight constraints provided by asteroseismic stellar ages, whenever available. A scenario where most carbon is produced by rotating massive stars, with yields largely dependent on the metallicity of the parent proto-star clouds, allowed us to simultaneously fit the high-quality data available for the local Galactic components (thick and thin discs) and for microlensed dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge, as well as the abundance ratios inferred for massive elliptical galaxies. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed from both observers and theoreticians in order to base these conclusions on firmer ground.},

Draco's star formation shut down long ago, making it a prime candidate for hosting a `pristine' dark matter cusp, unaffected by stellar feedback during galaxy formation. We first test GRAVSPHERE on a suite of tidally stripped mock `Draco'-like dwarfs. We show that we are able to correctly infer the dark matter density profile of both cusped and cored mocks within our 95 per cent confidence intervals. While we obtain only a weak inference on the logarithmic slope of these density profiles, we are able to obtain a robust inference of the amplitude of the inner dark matter density at 150 pc, {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc). We show that, combined with constraints on the density profile at larger radii, this is sufficient to distinguish a {$\Lambda$} Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cusp - that has {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc) {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1.8 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{$\odot$} kpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} - from alternative dark matter models that have lower inner densities. We then apply GRAVSPHERE to the real Draco data. We find that Draco has an inner dark matter density of {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc) = 2.4\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.5\} {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{$\odot$} kpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}, consistent with a {$\Lambda$}CDM cusp. Using a velocity-independent SIDM model, calibrated on {$\Lambda$}SIDM cosmological simulations, we show that Draco's high central density gives an upper bound on the SIDM cross-section of {$\sigma$}/m {$<$} 0.57 cm2 g-1 at 99 per cent confidence. We conclude that the inner density of nearby dwarf galaxies like Draco provides a new and competitive probe of dark matter models.},

  abstract = {The first stars were born from chemically pristine gas. They were likely massive, and thus they rapidly exploded as supernovae, enriching the surrounding gas with the first heavy elements. In the Local Group, the chemical signatures of the first stellar population were identified among low-mass, long-lived, very metal-poor ([Fe/H] {$<$} -2) stars, characterized by high abundances of carbon over iron ([C/Fe] {$>$} +0.7): the so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. Conversely, a similar carbon excess caused by first-star pollution was not found in dense neutral gas traced by absorption systems at different cosmic time. Here we present the detection of 14 very metal-poor, optically thick absorbers at redshift z {\textasciitilde} 3-4. Among these, 3 are carbon-enhanced and reveal an overabundance with respect to Fe of all the analyzed chemical elements (O, Mg, Al, and Si). Their relative abundances show a distribution with respect to [Fe/H] that is in very good agreement with those observed in nearby very metal-poor stars. All the tests we performed support the idea that these C-rich absorbers preserve the chemical yields of the first stars. Our new findings suggest that the first-star signatures can survive in optically thick but relatively diffuse absorbers, which are not sufficiently dense to sustain star formation and hence are not dominated by the chemical products of normal stars.},

  abstract = {We describe the first results from the Outer Limits Survey, an NOAO survey designed to detect, map, and characterize the extended structure of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The survey consists of deep images of 55 0fdg6 {\texttimes} 0fdg6 fields distributed at distances up to 20{$^\circ$} from the Clouds, with 10 fields at larger distances representing controls for contamination by Galactic foreground stars and background galaxies. The field locations probe the outer structure of both the LMC and SMC, as well as exploring areas defined by the Magellanic Stream, the Leading Arm, and the LMC orbit as recently measured from its proper motion. The images were taken with C, M, R, I, and DDO51 filters on the CTIO Blanco 4 m telescope and Mosaic2 camera, with supporting calibration observations taken at the CTIO 0.9 m telescope. The CRI images reach depths below the oldest main-sequence (MS) turnoffs at the distance of the Clouds, thus yielding numerous probes of structure combined with good ability to measure stellar ages and metallicities. The M and DDO51 images allow for discrimination of LMC and SMC giant stars from foreground dwarfs, allowing us to use giants as additional probes of Cloud structure and populations. From photometry of eight fields located at radii of 7{$^\circ$}-19{$^\circ$} north of the LMC bar, we find MS stars associated with the LMC out to 16{$^\circ$} from the LMC center, while the much rarer giants can only be convincingly detected out to 11{$^\circ$}. In one field, designated as a control, we see the unmistakable signature of the Milky Way (MW) globular cluster NGC 1851, which lies several tidal radii away from the field center. The color-magnitude diagrams show that while at 7{$^\circ$} radius LMC populations as young as 500 Myr are present, at radii gsim11{$^\circ$} only the LMC's underlying old metal-poor ([M/H] {\textasciitilde}-1) population remains, demonstrating the existence of a mean population gradient at these radii. Nevertheless, even at extreme large distances, the dominant age is significantly younger than that of the Galactic globular clusters. The MS star counts follow an exponential decline with distance with a scale length of 1.15 kpc, essentially the same scale length as gleaned for the inner LMC disk from prior studies. While we cannot rule out the existence of undetected tidal features elsewhere in the LMC periphery, the detection of an ordered structure to 12 disk scale lengths is unprecedented and adds to the puzzle of the LMC's interaction history with the SMC and the MW. Our results do not rule out the possible existence of an LMC stellar halo, which we show may only begin to dominate over the disk at still larger radii than where we have detected LMC populations.},

  abstract = {One of the big challenges for stellar astrophysics in the 21st century is the impact of binary interactions on stellar evolution. Binary interactions dominate a substantial fraction of stellar phenomenology, and specifically, are believed to underlie the formation of the overwhelming majority of Planetary Nebulae, which represent the bright end-stage of most stars in the Universe that evolve in a Hubble time. But the observational evidence for close binary companions in AGB stars is scarce. Our X-ray surveys of UV-emitting AGB stars shows that 40\% of objects with FUV emission and FUV/NUV flux ratios {$\greaterequivlnt$}0.2 have X-ray emission characterized by very high temperatures (Tx {\textasciitilde} 35-160 MK) and luminosities (Lx {\textasciitilde} 0.002-0.2 Lsun), indicating the presence of accretion associated with a close binary companion. UV spectroscopy with HST/STIS of our brightest object provides direct kinematic confirmation. However a substantial population of UV-emitting AGB stars shows mean FUV/NUV ratios of about {\textasciitilde}0.07 or less, and we do not know whether the UV emission from these is intrinsic to the AGB star (e.g., chromospheric) or due to binarity with low accretion activity. We have investigated this issue by (i) comparing the UV-emitting AGB sample with symbiotic stars, which are known binaries with a red giant primary and a white-dwarf secondary, and (ii) using a large grid of simple models using the CLOUDY code (Ferland+2013) to simulate UV emission from a hot chromospheric layer surrounding an AGB photosphere. We present results for the required physical parameters of the chromospheric layers that can fit the observed FUV/NUV ratio and UV fluxes.

In order to help distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic models of the puzzling high-energy emission of cool AGB stars, we report results from two studies---(i) XMM-Newton X-observations of two nuvAGB stars, and (ii) simple chromosphere modeling. In study (i), we detect the one which has the lower FUV/NUV ratio, with a total Lx = 0.00027 L{$\odot$}, and a spectrum best fitted with a dominant component at Tx{$\sim$}10 MK, most likely coronal emission from a main-sequence companion. Therefore, a significant fraction of nuvAGB stars may also be binaries with active, but weak accretion. Study (ii) shows that chromospheres with temperatures of {$\sim$}10,000 K can produce Rfuv/nuv{$\lessequivlnt$}0.06; higher ratios require hotter gas, implying active accretion.},

While the light element abundance variations are very common in globular clusters, they are comparatively rare in the Galactic halo field population. However, little is known regarding the occurrence of the abundance anomalies in other environments such as that of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Consequently, we have investigated the anticorrelation and bimodality of CH- and CN-band strengths, which are markers of the abundance variations in GGCs, in the spectra of red giants in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using spectra at the Na D lines, informed by similar spectra for five GGCs (NGC 288, 1851, 6752, 6809, and 7099), we have also searched for any correlation between CN and Na in the Sculptor red giant sample. Our results indicate that variations analogous to those seen in GGCs are not present in our Sculptor sample. Instead, we find a weak positive correlation between CH and CN and no correlation between Na and CN. We also reveal a deficiency in [Na/Fe] for the Sculptor stars relative to the values in GGCs, a result that is consistent with the previous work for dSph galaxies. The outcomes reinforce the apparent need for a high stellar density environment to produce the light element abundance variations.},

In this scenario dSph galaxies represent fossil objects virializing at z = 7.2 +/- 0.7 (i.e. in the pre-reionization era z {$>$} zrei = 6) in the MW environment which at that epoch has already been pre-enriched up to [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -3 their dynamical masses are in the narrow range M = (1.6 +/- 0.7) {\texttimes} 108Msolar, although a larger spread might be introduced by a more refined treatment of reionization. Mechanical feedback effects are dramatic in such low-mass objects, causing the complete blow-away of the gas {\textasciitilde}100 Myr after the formation epoch: 99 per cent of the present-day stellar mass, M* = (3 +/- 0.7) {\texttimes} 106Msolar, forms during this evolutionary phase, i.e. their age is {$>$}13 Gyr. Later on, star formation is re-ignited by returned gas from evolved stars and a second blow-away occurs. The cycle continues for about 1 Gyr during which star formation is intermittent. At z = 0 the dSph gas content is Mg = (2.68 +/- 0.97) {\texttimes} 104Msolar. Our results match several observed properties of Sculptor, used as a template of dSphs: (i) the metallicity distribution function; (ii) the colour-magnitude diagram; (iii) the decrement of the stellar [O/Fe] abundance ratio for [Fe/H] {$>$} -1.5 (iv) the dark matter content and the light-to-mass ratio; (v) the HI gas mass content.},

  abstract = {We investigate the success and problems of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in explaining the structural parameters and dynamics of remote Galactic globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Using the MOND value for the mass of the Milky Way, as inferred from the Galactic rotation curve, we derive the tidal radii of Galactic GCs and compare to observed values. Except for Pal 14, the predicted tidal radii of GCs are systematically larger than the observed nominal values. However, the associated uncertainties are so large that tidal radii are consistent on the 1 {$\sigma$} level. We have considered the importance of the Galactic tidal force on the survival of dSphs under MOND. Assuming mass-to-light ratios compatible with a naked stellar population, we found that the present Galactic dSphs preserve their integrity over one Hubble time, except for Sextans, which may survive the tidal interaction only for several Gyr. Mass-to-light ratios as inferred from the internal kinematics of dSph galaxies can be used, but they appear too large to be accounted for only by the stellar population in Willman 1, Coma Berenice, Ursa Minor, Draco, Ursa Major, and possibly Bo{\"o}tes dwarves. Finally, the ability of the Sculptor dwarf to retain the observed population of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is examined. Under the MOND paradigm, we find that the retention fraction in Sculptor is likely not larger than a few percent. Compared to the dark matter scenario, it turns out that MOND makes the retention problem worse. We propose that measurements of the radial velocities of the observed LMXBs in Sculptor could provide a way to distinguish between modified gravities or extended and massive dark matter halos.},

  abstract = {We investigate the ability of basis function expansions to reproduce the evolution of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo, extracted from a cosmological zoom-in simulation. For each snapshot, the density of the halo is reduced to a basis function expansion, with interpolation used to recreate the evolution between snapshots. The angular variation of the halo density is described by spherical harmonics, and the radial variation either by biorthonormal basis functions adapted to handle truncated haloes or by splines. High fidelity orbit reconstructions are attainable using either method with similar computational expense. We quantify how the error in the reconstructed orbits varies with expansion order and snapshot spacing. Despite the many possible biorthonormal expansions, it is hard to beat a conventional Hernquist-Ostriker expansion with a moderate number of terms ({$\greaterequivlnt$}15 radial and {$\greaterequivlnt$}6 angular). As two applications of the developed machinery, we assess the impact of the time-dependence of the potential on (i) the orbits of Milky Way satellites and (ii) planes of satellites as observed in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. Time evolution over the last 5 Gyr introduces an uncertainty in the Milky Way satellites' orbital parameters of \${\textbackslash}sim 15 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{per{\textbackslash}, cent\}\$, comparable to that induced by the observational errors or the uncertainty in the present-day Milky Way potential. On average, planes of satellites grow at similar rates in evolving and time-independent potentials. There can be more, or less, growth in the plane's thickness, if the plane becomes less, or more, aligned with the major or minor axis of the evolving halo.},

  abstract = {We review the available methods for estimating actions, angles and frequencies of orbits in both axisymmetric and triaxial potentials. The methods are separated into two classes. Unless an orbit has been trapped by a resonance, convergent, or iterative, methods are able to recover the actions to arbitrarily high accuracy given sufficient computing time. Faster non-convergent methods rely on the potential being sufficiently close to a separable potential, and the accuracy of the action estimate cannot be improved through further computation. We critically compare the accuracy of the methods and the required computation time for a range of orbits in an axisymmetric multicomponent Galactic potential. We introduce a new method for estimating actions that builds on the adiabatic approximation of Sch{\"o}nrich \& Binney and discuss the accuracy required for the actions, angles and frequencies using suitable distribution functions for the thin and thick discs, the stellar halo and a star stream. We conclude that for studies of the disc and smooth halo component of the Milky Way, the most suitable compromise between speed and accuracy is the St{\"a}ckel Fudge, whilst when studying streams the non-convergent methods do not offer sufficient accuracy and the most suitable method is computing the actions from an orbit integration via a generating function.

  abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group obey a relationship between the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and half-light radius, although there are a number of dwarfs that lie beneath this relation with suppressed velocity dispersion. The most discrepant of these (in the Milky Way) is the `feeble giant' Crater II. Using analytic arguments supported by controlled numerical simulations of tidally stripped flattened two-component dwarf galaxies, we investigate interpretations of Crater II within standard galaxy formation theory. Heavy tidal disruption is necessary to explain the velocity dispersion suppression which is plausible if the proper motion of Crater II is ({$\mu\alpha$}*, {$\mu\delta$}) = (-0.21 {\textpm} 0.09, -0.24 {\textpm} 0.09) mas yr-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the velocity dispersion of tidally disrupted systems is solely a function of the total mass-loss even for weakly embedded and flattened systems. The half-light radius evolution depends more sensitively on orbital phase and the properties of the dark matter profile. The half-light radius of weakly embedded cusped systems rapidly decreases producing some tension with the Crater II observations. This tension is alleviated by cored dark matter profiles, in which the half-light radius can grow after tidal disruption. The evolution of flattened galaxies is characterized by two competing effects: tidal shocking makes the central regions rounder whilst tidal distortion produces a prolate tidally locked outer envelope. After {$\sim$}70 per cent of the central mass is lost, tidal distortion becomes the dominant effect and the shape of the central regions of the galaxy tends to a universal prolate shape irrespective of the initial shape.},

This new phase-space view of our Galaxy demands new tools for comparing observations to simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies in a cosmological context, to test the physics of both dark matter and galaxy formation. We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to generate a suite of synthetic surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project, which feature self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds and thin stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to generate nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by assuming each star particle (of mass 7070 M \textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) represents a single stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust extinction from the simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We provide the complete simulation snapshot at z = 0 for each simulated galaxy. We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades. These synthetic surveys provide a tool for the scientific community to test analysis methods and interpret Gaia data.},

  abstract = {Understanding the evolution of satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) and M31 requires modelling their orbital histories across cosmic time. Many works that model satellite orbits incorrectly assume or approximate that the host halo gravitational potential is fixed in time and is spherically symmetric or axisymmetric. We rigorously benchmark the accuracy of such models against the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic simulations of MW/M31-mass haloes. When a typical surviving satellite fell in (\$3.4{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!9.7{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{Gyr\}\$ ago), the host halo mass and radius were typically 26-86 per cent of their values today, respectively. Most of this mass growth of the host occurred at small distances, \$r{\textbackslash}lesssim 50{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{kpc\}\$, opposite to dark matter only simulations, which experience almost no growth at small radii. We fit a near-exact axisymmetric gravitational potential to each host at z = 0 and backward integrate the orbits of satellites in this static potential, comparing against the true orbit histories in the simulations. Orbital energy and angular momentum are not well conserved throughout an orbital history, varying by 25 per cent from their current values already \$1.6{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!4.7{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{Gyr\}\$ ago. Most orbital properties are minimally biased, {$\lessequivlnt$}10 per cent, when averaged across the satellite population as a whole. However, for a single satellite, the uncertainties are large: recent orbital properties, like the most recent pericentre distance, typically are {$\approx$}20 per cent uncertain, while earlier events, like the minimum pericentre or the infall time, are {$\approx$}40-80 per cent uncertain. Furthermore, these biases and uncertainties are lower limits, given that we use near-exact host mass profiles at z = 0.},

These systems are selected to be close analogues to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the most massive satellite of the MW. The simulations allow us to address, in a cosmological context, the impact of the Clouds on the MW, including the contribution of Magellanic satellites to the MW satellite population, and the constraints placed on the Galactic potential by the motion of the LMC. We show that LMC-like satellites are twice more common around Local Group-like primaries than around isolated haloes of similar mass; these satellites come from large turnaround radii and are on highly eccentric orbits whose velocities at first pericentre are comparable with the primary's escape velocity. This implies \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm esc\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm MW\} (50\$ kpc) {\textasciitilde} 365 km s-1, a strong constraint on Galactic potential models. LMC analogues contribute about two satellites with \$M\_* 10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, having thus only a mild impact on the luminous satellite population of their hosts. At first pericentre, LMC-associated satellites are close to the LMC in position and velocity, and are distributed along the LMC's orbital plane. Their orbital angular momenta roughly align with the LMC's, but, interestingly, they may appear to 'counter-rotate' the MW in some cases. These criteria refine earlier estimates of the LMC association of MW satellites: only the SMC, Hydrus1, Car3, Hor1, Tuc4, Ret2, and Phoenix2 are compatible with all criteria. Carina, Grus2, Hor2, and Fornax are less probable associates given their large LMC relative velocity.},

The subsequent evolution of the CE, its ejection, and the formation of dust in its ejecta while the primary is on the red giant branch (RGB) gives rise to a recently identified evolutionary class-dusty post-RGB stars. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggest that their mass-ejecta are similar to dusty post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars. We have modeled the SEDs of a select sample of post-RGB and post-AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, quantified the total dust mass (and gas mass assuming gas-to-dust ratio) in the disks and shells and set constraints on the dust grain compositions and sizes. We find that the shell masses in the post-RGBs are generally less than those in post-AGBs, with the caveat that substantial amount of mass in both types of objects may lie in cold, extended shells. Our models suggest that circumstellar disks, when present, are geometrically thick structures with a substantial opening angle, consistent with numerical simulations of CE evolution (CEE). Comparison of our model dust masses with the predictions of dust production during CEE on the RGB suggest that CEE occurred near or at the tip of the RGB for our post-RGB sources. A surprising result is that some post-RGB stars harbor carbon-rich dust, believed to form when C/O {$>$} 1, e.g., following triple-alpha nucleosynthesis and third dredge-up events in AGB stars. This anomaly strengthens the hypothesis that dusty post-RGBs are born in binary systems.},

Aims: The main motivation for this work is to test an alternative method to the standard APOGEE pipeline (APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, ASPCAP) to derive parameters in the near-infrared for FGK dwarfs. Methods: iSpec and Turbospectrum are used to generate synthetic spectra matching APOGEE observations and to determine the parameters through {$\chi$}2 minimization. Results: We present spectroscopic parameters (Teff, [M/H], log g, vmic) for a sample of 3748 main-sequence and subgiant FGK stars, obtained from their APOGEE H-band spectra. Conclusions: We compare our output parameters with the ones obtained with ASPCAP for the same stellar spectrum, and find that the values agree within the expected uncertainties. A comparison with the optical samples California Planet Survey, High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher - Guaranteed Time Observations, and PASTEL is also available, and median differences below 10 K for Teff and 0.2 dex for [M/H] are found.

Although the simulation's star formation rate declines monotonically from its unique peak and no merger or tidal event ever takes place, the model replicates all known properties of a thick disc, as well as matching special features of the local stellar population such as a metal-poor extension of the thin disc that has high rotational velocity. We divide the disc by chemistry and relate this dissection to observationally more convenient kinematic selection criteria. We conclude that the observed chemistry of the Galactic disc does not provide convincing evidence for a violent origin of the thick disc, as has been widely claimed.},

Notwithstanding different types of slope failures have been studied on the Moon, a detailed lunar landslide inventory is still pending. Undoubtedly, such will be in a benefit for future geological and morphological studies, as well in hazard, risk and susceptibility assessments. A preliminary survey of lunar landslides in impact craters has been done using visual inspection on images and digital elevation model (DEM) (Brunetti et al. 2015) but this method suffers from subjective interpretation. A new methodology based on polynomial interpolation of crater cross-sections extracted from global lunar DEMs is presented in this paper. Because of their properties, Chebyshev polynomials were already exploited for parametric classification of different crater morphologies (Mahanti et al., 2014). Here, their use has been extended to the discrimination of slumps in simple impact craters. Two criteria for recognition have provided the best results: one based on fixing an empirical absolute thresholding and a second based on statistical adaptive thresholding. The application of both criteria to a data set made up of 204 lunar craters' cross-sections has demonstrated that the former criterion provides the best recognition.},

  abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 {$\mu$}m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 {$\mu$}m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 {$\mu$}m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 {$\mu$}m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 {$\mu$}m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 {$\mu$}m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 {$\mu$}m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 {$\mu$}m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux {\textasciitilde}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 {$\mu$}m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the formation, evolution and possible longevity of metallicity gradients in simulated dwarf galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the role of potentially orbit-changing processes such as radial stellar migration and dynamical heating in shaping or destroying these gradients. We also consider the influence of the star formation scheme, investigating both the low-density star formation threshold of 0.1\,a.m.u.\,cm-3, which has been in general use in the field, and the much higher threshold of 100\,cm-3, which, together with an extension of the cooling curves below 104~K and increase of the feedback efficiency, has been argued to represent a much more realistic description of star-forming regions.The N-body--SPH models that we use to self-consistently form and evolve dwarf galaxies in isolation show that, in the absence of significant angular momentum, metallicity gradients are gradually built up during the evolution of the dwarf galaxy, by ever more centrally concentrated star formation adding to the overall gradient. Once formed, they are robust and can easily survive in the absence of external disturbances, with their strength hardly declining over several Gyr, and they agree well with observed metallicity gradients of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. The underlying orbital displacement of stars is quite limited in our models, being of the order of only fractions of the half-light radius over time-spans of 5--10~Gyr in all star formation schemes. This is contrary to the strong radial migration found in massive disc galaxies, which is caused by scattering of stars off the corotation resonance of large-scale spiral structures. In the dwarf regime, the stellar body only seems to undergo mild dynamical heating, due to the lack of long-lived spiral structures and/or discs.The density threshold, while having profound influences on the star formation mode of the models, has only an minor influence on the evolution of metallicity gradients. Increasing the threshold 1000-fold causes comparatively stronger dynamical heating of the stellar body due to the increased turbulent gas motions and the scattering of stars off dense gas clouds, but the effect remains very limited in absolute terms.},

Such tests are particularly important for interpreting the surprising high-ionization ultraviolet (UV) line emission detected at z {$>$} 6 in recent years. We present HST/COS UV spectra of 10 nearby metal-poor star-forming galaxies selected to show He II emission in SDSS optical spectra. The targets span nearly a dex in gas-phase oxygen abundance (7.8 {$<$} 12 + log O/H {$<$} 8.5) and present uniformly large specific star formation rates (sSFR {$\sim$}102 Gyr-1). The UV spectra confirm that metal-poor stellar populations can power extreme nebular emission in high-ionization UV lines, reaching C III] equivalent widths comparable to those seen in systems at z {$\sim$} 6-7. Our data reveal a marked transition in UV spectral properties with decreasing metallicity, with systems below 12 + log O/H {$\lessequivlnt$} 8.0 (Z/Z{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1/5) presenting minimal stellar wind features and prominent nebular emission in He II and C IV. This is consistent with nearly an order of magnitude increase in ionizing photon production beyond the He+-ionizing edge relative to H-ionizing flux as metallicity decreases below a fifth solar, well in excess of standard stellar population synthesis predictions. Our results suggest that often-neglected sources of energetic radiation such as stripped binary products and very massive O-stars produce a sharper change in the ionizing spectrum with decreasing metallicity than expected. Consequently, nebular emission in C IV and He II powered by these stars may provide useful metallicity constraints in the reionization era.},

A Bayesian algorithm is used to find new candidate members in the extreme outskirts of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy. Precise metallicities and radial velocities (RVs) for two distant stars are measured from their spectra taken with the Gemini South GMOS spectrograph. The radial velocity, proper motion, and metallicity of these targets are consistent with Sculptor membership. As a result, the known boundary of the Sculptor dwarf extends now out to an elliptical distance of {\textasciitilde}10rh (half-light radii), which corresponds to a projected physical distance of {\textasciitilde}3 kpc. As reported in earlier work, the overall distribution of RVs and metallicities indicate the presence of a more spatially and kinematically dispersed metal-poor population that surrounds the more concentrated and colder metal-rich stars. Sculptor's density profile shows a 'kink' in its logarithmic slope at a projected distance of {\textasciitilde}25 arcmin (620 pc), which we interpret as evidence that Galactic tides have helped to populate the distant outskirts of the dwarf. We discuss further ways to test and validate this tidal interpretation for the origin of these distant stars.},

Evidence for a knee in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios near [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -2.1 indicates a low star-formation efficiency similar to that in other dwarf galaxies.

  abstract = {The Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy appears to contain two distinct stellar populations of differing metallicity. Several authors have argued that in order for these two populations to reside in the same gravitational potential, the dark matter halo must have a core similar to that observed in the stellar count profile. This would exclude cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles of the kind predicted for halos and subhalos by dark matter-only simulations of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model. We present a new theoretical framework to analyze observations of stellar count and velocity in a self-consistent manner based on separable models, f(E,J)=g(J)h(E), for the distribution function of an equilibrium spherical system. We use this machinery to analyze available photometric and kinematic data for the two stellar populations in Sculptor. We find, contrary to some previous claims, that the data are consistent with populations in equilibrium within an NFW dark matter potential with structural parameters in the range expected in {$\Lambda$}CDM we find no statistical preference for a potential with a core. Our models allow a maximum circular velocity for Sculptor between 20 and 35 km s-1. We discuss why some previous authors came to a different conclusion.},

  abstract = {The ([{$\alpha$}/Fe], [Fe/H]) distribution of Milky Way stars shows at least two distinct sequences, which have traditionally been associated with the thin and thick disc components. The abundance distribution varies systematically with location R and {\textbar}z{\textbar} across the Galaxy. We reproduce this using an analytical chemodynamical model that includes the effects of radial migration and kinematic heating. Unlike some earlier models, our scheme does not require a distinct thick disc component emerging from a separate evolutionary path. The proposed model has a continuous star formation history and a continuous age velocity dispersion relation. Moreover, [{$\alpha$}/Fe] is constant for stellar ages less than 8 Gyr, but increases sharply for older stars over a time-scale of 1.5 Gyr. The gap between the two sequences is due to this sharp transition. We show that the high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] sequence at the low-metallicity end is simply a pile-up of old stars, but towards the high-metallicity end, the age progressively decreases and stars have small birth radii. Our model successfully explains the uniformity of the locus of the high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] sequence across different locations. The low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] sequence contains stars with different birth radii that owes its existence to radial migration. For the low-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] stars, angular momentum is anticorrelated with [Fe/H], while the opposite is true for high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] stars. We show that the later trend can be explained by the increase of circular velocity with time. If radial migration is not included, the model fails to generate the double sequence and instead shows only a single sequence. Our simple scheme has major advantages over earlier chemodynamical models, as we show.},

  abstract = {Spectra for stars located redward of the fiducial red giant branches (RGBs) of the Ursa Minor and Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been obtained with the Hobby-Eberly telescope and the Marcario Low Resolution Spectrometer. From a comparison of our radial velocities with those reported in previous medium-resolution studies, we find an average difference of 10 km s-1 with a standard deviation of 11 km s-1. On the basis of these radial velocities, we confirm the membership of five stars in Ursa Minor and find two others to be nonmembers. One of the confirmed members is a known carbon star that lies redward of the RGB; three others are previously unidentified carbon stars. The fifth star is a red giant that was found previously by Shetrone and coworkers to have [Fe/H]=-1.68+/-0.11 dex. In Draco, we find eight nonmembers, confirm the membership of one known carbon star, and find two new members. One of these stars is a carbon star, while the other shows no evidence for C2 bands or strong atomic bands, although the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is low. Thus, we find no evidence for a population of stars more metal-rich than [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}=-1.45 dex in either of these galaxies. Indeed, our spectroscopic survey suggests that every candidate suspected of having a metallicity in excess of this value based on its position in the color-magnitude diagram is, in actuality, a carbon star. Based on the census of 13 known carbon stars in these two galaxies, we estimate the carbon star specific frequency to be {$\varepsilon$}dSph{\textasciitilde}=2.4{\texttimes}10-5 L-1V,solar, 25-100 times higher than that of Galactic globular clusters.

  abstract = {We perform a search for stellar streams around the Milky Way using the first 3 yr of multiband optical imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We use DES data covering {$\sim$}5000 deg2 to a depth of g {$>$} 23.5 with a relative photometric calibration uncertainty of {$<$}1\%. This data set yields unprecedented sensitivity to the stellar density field in the southern celestial hemisphere, enabling the detection of faint stellar streams to a heliocentric distance of {$\sim$}50 kpc. We search for stellar streams using a matched filter in color-magnitude space derived from a synthetic isochrone of an old, metal-poor stellar population. Our detection technique recovers four previously known thin stellar streams: Phoenix, ATLAS, Tucana III, and a possible extension of Molonglo. In addition, we report the discovery of 11 new stellar streams. In general, the new streams detected by DES are fainter, more distant, and lower surface brightness than streams detected by similar techniques in previous photometric surveys. As a by-product of our stellar stream search, we find evidence for extratidal stellar structure associated with four globular clusters: NGC 288, NGC 1261, NGC 1851, and NGC 1904. The ever-growing sample of stellar streams will provide insight into the formation of the Galactic stellar halo, the Milky Way gravitational potential, and the large- and small-scale distribution of dark matter around the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Stellar streams are excellent probes of the underlying gravitational potential in which they evolve. In this work, we fit dynamical models to five streams in the Southern Galactic hemisphere, combining observations from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S 5), Gaia EDR3, and the Dark Energy Survey, to measure the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With an ensemble of streams, we find a mass of the LMC ranging from {\textasciitilde}14-19 {\texttimes} 1010 M {$\odot$}, probed over a range of closest approach times and distances. With the most constraining stream (Orphan-Chenab), we measure an LMC mass of \$\{18.8\}\_\{-4.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.5\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , probed at a closest approach time of 310 Myr and a closest approach distance of 25.4 kpc. This mass is compatible with previous measurements, showing that a consistent picture is emerging of the LMC's influence on structures in the Milky Way. Using this sample of streams, we find that the LMC's effect depends on the relative orientation of the stream and LMC at their point of closest approach. To better understand this, we present a simple model based on the impulse approximation and we show that the LMC's effect depends both on the magnitude of the velocity kick imparted to the stream and the direction of this kick.},

This analysis is based on high-resolution two-dimensional H{$\alpha$} velocity fields of NGC 4605, NGC 5949, NGC 5963, and NGC 6689 and CO velocity fields of NGC 4605 and NGC 5963. In combination with our previous study of NGC 2976, the full sample of five galaxies contains density profiles that span the range from {$\alpha$}DM = 0 to {$\alpha$}DM = 1.20, where {$\alpha$}DM is the power-law index describing the central density profile. The scatter in {$\alpha$}DM from galaxy to galaxy is 0.44, 3 times as large as in cold dark matter (CDM) simulations, and the mean density profile slope is {$\alpha$}DM = 0.73, shallower than that predicted by the simulations. These results call into question the hypothesis that all galaxies share a universal dark matter density profile. We show that one of the galaxies in our sample, NGC 5963, has a cuspy density profile that closely resembles those seen in CDM simulations, demonstrating that while galaxies with the steep central density cusps predicted by CDM do exist, they are in the minority. In spite of these differences between observations and simulations, the relatively cuspy density profiles we find do not suggest that this problem represents a crisis for CDM. Improving the resolution of the simulations and incorporating additional physics may resolve the remaining discrepancies. We also find that four of the galaxies contain detectable radial motions in the plane of the galaxy. We investigate the hypothesis that these motions are caused by a triaxial dark matter halo and place lower limits on the ellipticity of the orbits in the plane of the disk of 0.043-0.175.},

Their large relative velocities demonstrate that the satellites are unrelated despite their close physical proximity. We determine a velocity dispersion for Tuc IV of {$\sigma$} = 4.3-1.0+1.7 km s-1, but we cannot resolve the velocity dispersions of the other two systems. For Gru II, we place an upper limit (90\% confidence) on the dispersion of {$\sigma$} {$<$} 1.9 km s-1, and for Tuc V, we do not obtain any useful limits. All three satellites have metallicities below [Fe/H]=-2.1, but none has a detectable metallicity spread. We determine proper motions for each satellite based on Gaia astrometry and compute their orbits around the Milky Way. Gru II is on a tightly bound orbit with a pericenter of 25-7+6 kpc and orbital eccentricity of 0.45-0.05+0.08. Tuc V likely has an apocenter beyond 100 kpc and could be approaching the Milky Way for the first time. The current orbit of Tuc IV is similar to that of Gru II, with a pericenter of 25-8+11 kpc and an eccentricity of 0.36-0.06+0.13. However, a backward integration of the position of Tuc IV demonstrates that it collided with the Large Magellanic Cloud at an impact parameter of 4 kpc {$\sim$}120 Myr ago, deflecting its trajectory and possibly altering its internal kinematics. Based on their sizes, masses, and metallicities, we classify Gru II and Tuc IV as likely dwarf galaxies, but the nature of Tuc V remains uncertain.},

  abstract = {The second data release from the Gaia mission (DR2) provides a comprehensive and unprecedented picture of the motions of astronomical sources in the plane of the sky, extending from the solar neighborhood to the outer reaches of the Milky Way. I present proper-motion measurements based on Gaia DR2 for 17 ultra-faint dwarf galaxies within 100 kpc of the Milky Way. I compile the spectroscopically confirmed member stars in each dwarf bright enough for Gaia astrometry from the literature, producing member samples ranging from two stars in Triangulum II to 68 stars in Bo{\"o}tes I. From the spectroscopic member catalogs, I estimate the proper motion of each system. I find good agreement with the proper motions derived by the Gaia collaboration for Bo{\"o}tes I and Leo I. The tangential velocities for 14 of the 17 dwarfs are determined to better than 50 km s-1, more than doubling the sample of such measurements for Milky Way satellite galaxies. The orbital pericenters are well constrained, with a mean value of 38 kpc. Only one satellite, Tucana III, is on an orbit passing within 15 kpc of the Galactic center, suggesting that the remaining ultra-faint dwarfs are unlikely to have experienced severe tidal stripping. As a group, the ultra-faint dwarfs are on high-velocity, eccentric, retrograde trajectories, with nearly all of them having space motions exceeding 370 km s-1. A large majority of the objects are currently close to the pericenters of their orbits. In a low-mass (M vir = 0.9 {\texttimes} 1012 M {$\odot$}) Milky Way potential, eight out of the 17 galaxies lack well-defined apocenters and appear likely to be on their first infall, indicating that the Milky Way mass may be larger than previously estimated or that many of the ultra-faint dwarfs are associated with the Magellanic Clouds. The median eccentricity of the ultra-faint dwarf orbits is 0.79, similar to the values seen in numerical simulations but distinct from the rounder orbits of the more luminous dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {The lowest luminosity (L {$<$} 105L{$\odot$}) Milky Way satellite galaxies represent the extreme lower limit of the galaxy luminosity function. These ultra-faint dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter-dominated, most metal-poor, and least chemically evolved stellar systems known. They therefore provide unique windows into the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on small scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005 and the subsequent observational and theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns, structural properties, stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, as well as what can be learned from each type of measurement. We conclude the following: In most cases, the stellar velocity dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic uncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination. The chemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources of r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star mergers. Even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their stellar components. Determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of observing time with future telescopes.Finally, we offer a look forward at the observations that will be possible with future facilities as the push toward a complete census of the Local Group dwarf galaxy population continues.},

  abstract = {Using multi-element abundances from the SDSS APOGEE survey, we investigate the origin of abundance variations in Milky Way (MW) disk stars on the "high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ plateau," with \$-0.8{\textbackslash}leq{\textbackslash}rm\{[Fe/H]\}{\textbackslash}leq-0.4\$ and \$0.25{\textbackslash}leq{\textbackslash}rm\{[Mg/Fe]\}{\textbackslash}leq0.35\$. The elevated [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] ratios of these stars imply low enrichment contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), but it is unclear whether their abundance patterns reflect pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) enrichment. We find that plateau stars with higher [Fe/Mg] ratios also have higher [X/Mg] ratios for other iron-peak elements, suggesting that the [Fe/Mg] variations in the plateau population do reflect variations in the SNIa/CCSN ratio. To quantify this finding, we fit the observed abundance patterns with a two-process model, calibrated on the full MW disk, which represents each star's abundances as the sum of a prompt CCSN process with amplitude \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{cc\}\}\$ and a delayed SNIa process with amplitude \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Ia\}\}\$. This model is generally successful at explaining the observed trends of [X/Mg] with \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Ia\}\}/A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{cc\}\}\$, which are steeper for elements with a large SNIa contribution (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mn) and flatter for elements with low SNIa contribution (e.g., O, Si, Ca). Our analysis does not determine the value of [Mg/Fe] corresponding to pure CCSN enrichment, but it should be at least as high as the upper edge of the plateau at \${\textbackslash}rm\{[Mg/Fe]\}{\textbackslash}approx0.35\$, and could be significantly higher. Compared to the two-process predictions, the observed trends of [X/Mg] with \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{Ia\}\}/A\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{cc\}\}\$ are steeper for (C+N) but shallower for Ce, providing intriguing but contradictory clues about AGB enrichment in the early disk.},

Here we report the detection of an ultra-metal-poor star in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy AS0039. With [Fe/H]LTE = -4.11, it is the most metal-poor star discovered in any external galaxy thus far. Contrary to the majority of Milky Way stars at this metallicity, AS0039 is clearly not enhanced in carbon, with [C/Fe]LTE = -0.75, and A(C) = +3.60, making it the lowest detected carbon abundance in any star to date. Furthermore, it lacks {$\alpha$}-element uniformity, having extremely low [Mg/Ca]NLTE = -0.60 and [Mg/Ti]NLTE = -0.86, in stark contrast with the near solar ratios observed in C-normal stars within the Milky Way halo. The unique abundance pattern indicates that AS0039 formed out of material that was predominantly enriched by a {\textasciitilde}20 M{$\odot$} progenitor star with an unusually high explosion energy E = 10 {\texttimes} 1051 erg. Therefore, star AS0039 represents some of the first observational evidence for zero-metallicity hypernovae and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the diverse nature of Population III stars. * Based on observations made with ESO VLT/X-SHOOTER at the La Silla Paranal observatory under program ID 0102.B-0786.},

  abstract = {The Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is old and metal-poor, making it ideal to study the earliest chemical enrichment in the Local Group. We followed up on the most metal-poor star known in this (or any external) galaxy, AS0039, with high-resolution ESO VLT/UVES spectra. Our new analysis confirmed its low metallicity, [Fe/H]LTE = -3.90 {\textpm} 0.15, and that it is extremely C-poor, with A(C) = + 3.60, which corresponds to [C/Fe]LTE = -0.33 {\textpm} 0.17 (accounting for internal mixing). This adds to the evidence of Sculptor being intrinsically C-poor at low [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -3. However, here we also report a new discovery of a carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP-no) star in Sculptor, DR20080, with no enhancement of Ba, indicative of enrichment by zero-metallicity low-energy supernovae, ESN {$<$} 1 {\texttimes} 1051. This is the first piece of evidence of a dual population of CEMP-no and C-normal stars in Sculptor at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3. The fraction of CEMP-no stars is still low, fCEMPScl = 9-8+11\% at -4 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3, compared to the significantly higher fraction in the Milky Way halo, fCEMPMW {$\approx$} 40\%. To further investigate the early chemical enrichment of Sculptor, we re-derived chemical abundances of light, {$\alpha$}, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements in all Sculptor stars at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -2.8, with available high-resolution spectra. Our results show that at these low [Fe/H], Sculptor is deficient in light elements (e.g. C, Na, Al, Mg) relative to both the Milky Way halo, and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, pointing towards a significant contribution from high-energy supernovae. Furthermore, the abundance pattern of the star AS0039 is best fitted with a zero-metallicity hypernova progenitor, ESN = 10 {\texttimes} 1051, with a mass of M = 20 M{$\odot$}. Our results in Sculptor, at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3, therefore suggest significant enrichment by both very low-energy supernovae and hypernovae, solidifying this galaxy as one of the benchmarks for understanding the energy distribution of the first supernova in the Universe.

The bifurcation diagram reveals a rich structure, with many phenomena detected for the first time in hydrodynamic models of pulsating stars. The phenomena include not only period doubling cascades en route to chaos (detected in earlier studies) but also periodic windows within chaotic band, type-I and type-III intermittent behaviour, interior crisis bifurcation and others. Such phenomena are known in many textbook chaotic systems, from the simplest discrete logistic map, to more complex systems like Lorenz equations. We discuss the physical relevance of our models. Although except of period doubling such phenomena were not detected in any BL Her star, chaotic variability was claimed in several higher luminosity siblings of BL Her stars - RV Tau variables, and also in longer-period, luminous irregular pulsators. Our models may help to understand these poorly studied stars. Particularly interesting are periodic windows which are intrinsic property of chaotic systems and are not necessarily caused by resonances between pulsation modes, as sometimes claimed in the literature.},

  abstract = {We investigate whether the considerable diversity in the satellite populations of nearby Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies is connected with the diversity in their host's merger histories. Analyzing eight nearby galaxies with extensive observations of their satellite populations and stellar halos, we characterize each galaxy's merger history using the metric of its most dominant merger, M {$\star$},Dom, defined as the greater of either its total accreted stellar mass or most massive current satellite. We find an unexpectedly tight relationship between these galaxies' number of M V {$<$} - 9 satellites within 150 kpc (N Sat) and M {$\star$},Dom. This relationship remains even after accounting for differences in galaxy mass. Using the star formation and orbital histories of satellites around the MW and M81, we demonstrate that both likely evolved along the M {$\star$},Dom-N Sat relation during their current dominant mergers with the Large Magellanic Cloud and M82, respectively. We investigate the presence of this relation in galaxy formation models, including using the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations to directly compare to the observations. We find no relation between M {$\star$},Dom and N Sat in FIRE, and a universally large scatter in N Sat with M {$\star$},Dom across simulations-in direct contrast with the tightness of the empirical relation. This acute difference in the observed and predicted scaling relation between two fundamental galaxy properties signals that current simulations do not sufficiently reproduce diverse merger histories and their effects on satellite populations. Explaining the emergence of this relation is therefore essential for obtaining a complete understanding of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {Context. The ongoing Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey is using FLAMES at the VLT to obtain high-quality medium-resolution Giraffe spectra for about 105 stars and high-resolution UVES spectra for about 5000 stars. With UVES, the Survey has already observed 1447 FGK-type stars. Aims: These UVES spectra are analyzed in parallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. Our aim is to present how these analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe how a final recommended parameter scale is defined. We also discuss the precision (method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to the reference values) of the final parameters. These results are part of the Gaia-ESO second internal release and will be part of its first public release of advanced data products. Methods: The final parameter scale is tied to the scale defined by the Gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmospheric parameters. In addition, a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate the physical soundness of the results. Each of the implemented methodologies is judged against the benchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameter space. The final recommended results are the weighted medians of those from the individual methods. Results: The recommended results successfully reproduce the atmospheric parameters of the benchmark stars and the expected Teff-log g relation of the calibrating clusters. Atmospheric parameters and abundances have been determined for 1301 FGK-type stars observed with UVES. The median of the method-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 K for Teff, 0.13 dex for log g and 0.07 dex for [Fe/H]. Systematic biases are estimated to be between 50-100 K for Teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g and 0.05-0.10 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for 24 elements were derived: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, Nd, and Eu. The typical method-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex. Conclusions: The Gaia-ESO sample of high-resolution spectra of FGK-type stars will be among the largest of its kind analyzed in a homogeneous way. The extensive list of elemental abundances derived in these stars will enable significant advances in the areas of stellar evolution and Milky Way formation and evolution.

The models are produced by combining three separate Miyamoto-Nagai discs. Such models have been used previously to model the disc of the Milky Way, but here we extend this framework to allow its application to discs of any mass, scalelength, and a wide range of thickness from infinitely thin to near spherical (ellipticities from 0 to 0.9). The models have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and we expect faster run speeds over a double exponential disc treatment. The potentials are fully analytical, and differentiable at all points. The mass distribution of our models deviates from the radial mass distribution of a pure exponential disc by {$<$}0.4 per cent out to 4 disc scalelengths, and {$<$}1.9 per cent out to 10 disc scalelengths. We tabulate fitting parameters which facilitate construction of exponential discs for any scalelength, and a wide range of disc thickness (a user-friendly, web-based interface is also available). Our recipe is well suited for numerical modelling of the tidal effects of a giant disc galaxy on star clusters or dwarf galaxies. We consider three worked examples; the Milky Way thin and thick disc, and a discy dwarf galaxy.},

Despite its being compact (r h = 3 {\textpm} 1 pc) and composed of few stars, we confirm the reality of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 with Keck II/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy and identify 11 radial velocity members, eight of which have full astrometric data from Gaia and are co-moving based on their proper motions. Based on these 11 radial velocity members, we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion of \$\{3.7\}\_\{-1.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\}\$ km s-1 but some caveats preclude this value from being interpreted as a direct indicator of the underlying gravitational potential at this time. Primarily, the exclusion of the largest velocity outlier from the member list drops the velocity dispersion to \$\{1.9\}\_\{-1.1\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\}\$ km s-1, and the subsequent removal of an additional outlier star produces an unresolved velocity dispersion. While the presence of binary stars may be inflating the measurement, the possibility of a significant velocity dispersion makes Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 a high-priority candidate for multi-epoch spectroscopic follow-ups to deduce the true nature of this incredibly faint satellite.},

We study the detailed orbital histories of both Draco and Sculptor via numerical orbit integrations. Orbital periods of Draco and Sculptor are found to be 1-2 Gyr and 2-5 Gyr, respectively, accounting for uncertainties in the Milky Way (MW) mass. We also study the influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the orbits of Draco and Sculptor. Overall, the inclusion of the LMC increases the scatter in the orbital results. Based on our calculations, Draco shows a rather wide range of orbital parameters depending on the MW mass and inclusion/exclusion of the LMC, but Sculptor's orbit is very well constrained, with its most recent pericentric approach to the MW being 0.3-0.4 Gyr ago. Our new PMs imply that the orbital trajectories of both Draco and Sculptor are confined within the ``Disk of Satellites,'' better so than implied by earlier PM measurements, and likely rule out the possibility that these two galaxies were accreted together as part of a tightly bound group.},

  abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z {\^a}{$\frac{1}{4}$} 2-3) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

This yields a data set that spans 19 years, has 14 different epochs of observation, and contains 372 unique red giant branch stars, 196 of which have repeat observations. Using this multi-epoch data set, we constrain the binary fraction for Leo II. We generate a suite of Monte Carlo simulations that test different binary fractions using Bayesian analysis and determine that the binary fraction for Leo II ranges from \{0.30\}-0.10+0.09 to \{0.34\}-0.11+0.11, depending on the distributions of binary orbital parameters assumed. This value is smaller than what has been found for the solar neighborhood ({$\sim$}0.4-0.6) but falls within the wide range of values that have been inferred for other dwarf spheroidals (0.14-0.69). The distribution of orbital periods has the greatest impact on the binary fraction results. If the fraction we find in Leo II is present in low-mass ultra-faints, it can artificially inflate the velocity dispersion of those systems and cause them to appear more dark matter rich than in actuality. For a galaxy with an intrinsic dispersion of 1 km s-1 and an observational sample of 100 stars, the dispersion can be increased by a factor of 1.5-2 for Leo II-like binary fractions or by a factor of three for binary fractions on the higher end of what has been seen in other dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {Measuring the frequency of binary stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) requires data taken over long time intervals. We combine radial velocity measurements from five literature sources taken over the course of {$\sim$}30 years to yield the largest multi-epoch kinematic sample for stars in the dSphs Draco and Ursa Minor. With this data set, we are able to implement an improved version of the Bayesian technique described in Spencer et al. to evaluate the binary fraction of red giant stars in these dwarf galaxies. Assuming Duquennoy \& Mayor period and mass ratio distributions, the binary fractions in Draco and Ursa Minor are \{0.50\}-0.06+0.04 and \{0.78\}-0.08+0.09, respectively. We find that a normal mass ratio distribution is preferred over a flat distribution, and that log-normal period distributions centered on long periods (\{{$\mu$} \}logP\vphantom\{\}{$>$} 3.5) are preferred over distributions centered on short ones. We reanalyzed the binary fractions in Leo II, Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans, and find that there is {$<$}1\% chance that binary fraction is a constant quantity across all seven dwarfs, unless the period distribution varies greatly. This indicates that the binary populations in Milky Way dSphs are not identical in regard to their binary fractions, period distributions, or both. We consider many different properties of the dwarfs (e.g., mass, radius, luminosity, etc.) and find that binary fraction might be larger in dwarfs that formed their stars quickly and/or have high velocity dispersions.},

Within its virial radius this model contains about 2{\texttimes}107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

We have also simulated a sample of six ultrahighly resolved Milky Way sized haloes, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300000 gravitationally bound subhaloes within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors of up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhaloes with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhaloes within subhaloes, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhaloes than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhaloes than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3 per cent within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1 per cent within the solar circle. The inner density profiles of subhaloes show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fitted by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated haloes are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5kms-1, an extrapolation over some five orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhaloes are more concentrated than field haloes, with a characteristic density that is typically {\textasciitilde}2.6 times larger and increases with decreasing distance from halo centre.},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

  abstract = {The evolution of a binary star system by various analytic approximations of mass transfer is discussed, with particular attention payed to the stability of these processes against runaway on the thermal and dynamical timescales of the mass donating star. Mass transfer in red giant - neutron star binary systems is used as a specific example of such mass transfer, and is investigated. Hjellming \& Webbink's (1987) results on the dynamic timescale response of a convective star with a core to mass loss are applied, with new results. It is found that mass transfer is usually stable, as long as the wind's specific angular momentum does not exceed the angular momentum per reduced mass of the system. This holds for both dynamical and thermal timescales. Those systems which are not stable will usually transfer mass on the thermal timescale. Included are graphs illustrating the variation of (dln(r\_L\_))/(dln(m))={$\zeta\_$}L\_ with mass ratio in the binary, for various parameters in the non-conservative mass transfer, as well as evolutionary paths of interacting red giant neutron star binaries.},

  abstract = {We investigate the in-spiralling time-scales of globular clusters (GCs) in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies, due to dynamical friction (DF). We address the problem of these time-scales having been variously estimated in the literature as much shorter than a Hubble time. Using self-consistent two-component (dark matter and stars) models, we explore mechanisms which may yield extended DF time-scales in such systems in order to explain why dwarf galaxies often show GC systems. As a general rule, dark matter and stars both give a comparable contribution to the dynamical drag. By exploring various possibilities for their gravitational make-up, it is shown that these studies help to constrain the parameters of the dark matter haloes in these galaxies, as well as to test alternatives to dark matter. Under the assumption of a dark halo having a central density core with a typical King core radius somewhat larger than the observed stellar core radius, DF time-scales are naturally extended upwards of a Hubble time. Cuspy dark haloes yield time-scales {$\lessequivlnt$}4.5 Gyr, for any dark halo parameters in accordance with observations of stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion in dSph galaxies. We confirm, after a detailed formulation of the DF problem under the alternative hypothesis of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and in the lack of any dark matter, that due to the enhanced dynamical drag of the stars, the DF time-scales in MOND would be extremely short. Taking the well-measured structural parameters of the Fornax dSph and its GC system as a case study, we conclude that requiring DF time-scales comparable to the Hubble time strongly favours dark haloes with a central core.},

The models form an evolutionary sequence starting from a confignration whose isothermal core contains the -Chandrasekhar limitating mass. It is found that, as the cores contract, the envelopes greatly expand. Thus from the initial confignration, which is near the main sequence, the stars evolve rapidly to the right in the H-R diagram, amply covering the giant region. In this evolution the gravitational contraction contributes less than 4 per cent to the total luminosity. A comparison of this theoretical evolution with the observed H-R diagram for globular clusters appears to explain the sudden turnoff from the main sequence to the giant region at about Mb = +3.5.},

Deep rest-frame ultraviolet spectra reveal large equivalent width emission from numerous emission lines (N IV], O III], C IV, Si III], C III]) which are rarely seen in individual spectra of more massive star-forming galaxies. C III] is detected in 16 of 17 low-mass star-forming systems with rest-frame equivalent widths as large as 13.5 {\AA}. Nebular C IV emission is present in the most extreme C III] emitters, requiring an ionizing source capable of producing a substantial component of photons with energies in excess of 47.9 eV. Photoionization models support a picture whereby the large equivalent widths are driven by the increased electron temperature and enhanced ionizing output arising from metal-poor gas and stars (0.04-0.13 Z{$\odot$}), young stellar populations (6-50 Myr), and large ionization parameters (log U = -2.16 to -1.84). The young ages implied by the emission lines and continuum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicate that the extreme line emitters in our sample are in the midst of a significant upturn in their star formation activity. The low stellar masses, blue UV colours, and large specific star formation rates of our sample are similar to those of typical z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 6 galaxies. Given the strong attenuation of Ly{$\alpha$} in z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 6 galaxies, we suggest that C III] is likely to provide our best probe of early star-forming galaxies with ground-based spectrographs and one off the most efficient means of confirming z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10 galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

Since the same massive stars are responsible for the observed FUV continuum and for the excitation of the observed nebular emission, a self-consistent stellar population synthesis model should simultaneously match the details of the FUV stellar+nebular continuum and---when inserted as the excitation source in photoionization models---predict all observed nebular emission line ratios. We find that only models including massive star binaries, having low stellar metallicity (\{Z\}* /\{Z\}{$\odot$} {$\simeq$} 0.1) but relatively high nebular (ionized gas-phase) abundances (\{Z\}\{\{neb\}\}/\{Z\}{$\odot$} {$\simeq$} 0.5), can successfully match all of the observational constraints. We show that this apparent discrepancy is naturally explained by highly super-solar O/Fe ({$\simeq$} 4\{--\}5 \{(\{\{O\}\}/\{Fe\})\}{$\odot$} ), expected for a gas whose enrichment is dominated by the products of core-collapse supernovae. While O dominates the physics of the ionized gas (and thus the nebular emission lines), Fe dominates the extreme-UV (EUV) and FUV opacity and controls the mass-loss rate from massive stars, resulting in particularly dramatic effects for massive stars in binary systems. This high nebular excitation---caused by the hard EUV spectra of Fe-poor massive stars---is much more common at high redshift (z{$\greaterequivlnt$} 2) than low redshift due to systematic differences in the star formation history of typical galaxies.

On the average, Draco and Ursa Minor giants reveal a systematic enhancement of the G band of CH relative to globular-cluster stars of comparable metallicities and temperatures; some individual stars, however, show G bands appropriate to their metallicities.

A determination of the mass of these galaxies provides a test of galaxy formation at the smallest scales and probes the nature of the dark matter that dominates the mass density of the Universe. Here we use new measurements of the velocities of the stars in these galaxies to show that they are consistent with them having a common mass of about 107 within their central 300parsecs. This result demonstrates that the faintest of the Milky Way satellites are the most dark-matter-dominated galaxies known, and could be a hint of a new scale in galaxy formation or a characteristic scale for the clustering of dark matter.},

Further understanding of what these galaxies reveal about cosmology and the small scale structure of dark matter relies in large part on a more detailed interpretation of their internal kinematics. This article discusses a likelihood formalism that extracts important quantities from the kinematic data, including the amplitude of rotation, proper motion, and the mass distribution. In the simplest model the projected error on the rotational amplitude is shown to be \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5 \$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$ stars from either classical or ultra-faint satellites. The galaxy Sculptor is analyzed for the presence of a rotational signal; no significant detection of rotation is found, and given this result limits are derived on the Sculptor proper motion. A criteria for model selection is discussed that determines the parameters required to describe the dark matter halo density profiles and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Applied to four data sets with a wide range of velocities, the likelihood is found to be more sensitive to variations in the slope of the dark matter density profile than variations in the velocity anisotropy. Models with variable radial velocity anisotropy are shown to be preferred relative to those in which this quantity is constant at all radii in the galaxy.},

  abstract = {Apparent exponential surface density profiles are nearly universal in galaxy discs across Hubble types, over a wide mass range, and a diversity of gravitational potential forms. Several processes have been found to produce exponential profiles, including the actions of bars and spirals, and clump scattering, with star scattering a common theme in these. Based on reasonable physical constraints, such as minimal entropy gradients, we propose steady-state distribution functions for disc stars, applicable over a range of gravitational potentials. The resulting surface density profiles are generally a power-law term times a S{\'e}rsic-type exponential. Over a modest range of S{\'e}rsic index values, these profiles are often indistinguishable from Type I exponentials, except at the innermost radii. However, in certain parameter ranges, these steady states can appear as broken, Type II or III profiles. The corresponding velocity dispersion profiles are low-order power laws. A chemical potential associated with scattering can help understand the effects of long-range scattering. The steady profiles are found to persist through constant velocity expansions or contractions in evolving discs. The proposed distributions and profiles are simple and solve the stellar hydrodynamic equations. They may be especially relevant to thick discs that have settled to a steady form via scattering.},

  abstract = {We present a model for the remnants of haloes that have gone through an adiabatic tidal stripping process. We show that this model exactly reproduces the remnant of an NFW halo that is exposed to a slowly increasing isotropic tidal field and approximately for an anisotropic tidal field. The model can be used to predict the asymptotic mass loss limit for orbiting subhaloes, solely as a function of the initial structure of the subhalo and the value of the tidal field at pericentre. Predictions can easily be made for differently concentrated host-haloes with and without baryonic components, which differ most notably in their relation between pericentre radius and tidal field. The model correctly predicts several empirically measured relations such as the 'tidal track' and the 'orbital frequency relation' that was reported by Errani \& Navarro (2021) for the case of an isothermal sphere. Further, we propose applications of the 'structure-tide' degeneracy, which implies that increasing the concentration of a subhalo has exactly the same impact on tidal stripping as reducing the amplitude of the tidal field. Beyond this, we find that simple relations hold for the bound mass, truncation radius, WIMP annihilation luminosity, and tidal ratio of tidally stripped NFW haloes in relation to quantities measured at the radius of maximum circular velocity. Finally, we note that NFW haloes cannot be completely disrupted when exposed adiabatically to tidal fields of arbitrary magnitudes. We provide an open-source implementation of our model and suggest that it can be used to improve predictions of dark matter annihilation.},

  abstract = {Context. Carbon, oxygen and nitrogen (CNO) are key elements in stellar formation and evolution, and their abundances should also have a significant impact on planetary formation and evolution. Aims: We aim to present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 1110 solar-type stars, 143 of which are known to have planetary companions. We have determined the carbon abundances of these stars and investigate a possible connection between C and the presence of planetary companions. Methods: We used the HARPS spectrograph to obtain high-resolution optical spectra of our targets. Spectral synthesis of the CH band at 4300 {\AA} was performed with the spectral synthesis codes MOOG and FITTING. Results: We have studied carbon in several reliable spectral windows and have obtained abundances and distributions that show that planet host stars are carbon rich when compared to single stars, a signature caused by the known metal-rich nature of stars with planets. We find no different behaviour when separating the stars by the mass of the planetary companion Conclusions: We conclude that reliable carbon abundances can be derived for solar-type stars from the CH band at 4300 {\AA}. We confirm two different slope trends for [C/Fe] with [Fe/H] because the behaviour is opposite for stars above and below solar values. We observe a flat distribution of the [C/Fe] ratio for all planetary masses, a finding that apparently excludes any clear connection between the [C/Fe] abundance ratio and planetary mass.

  abstract = {We combine the kinematics of 159 globular clusters (GCs) provided by the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) with other observational data to classify the GCs, and to estimate the mass of the Milky Way (MW). We use the age-metallicity relation, integrals of motion, action space and the GC orbits to identify the GCs as either formed in situ (Bulge and Disk) or ex situ (via accretion). We find that 45.3\% have formed in situ, while 38.4\% may be related to known merger events: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, the Helmi streams, the Sequoia galaxy and the Kraken galaxy. We also further identify three new sub-structures associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. The remaining 16.3\% of GCs are unrelated to the known mergers and thought to be from small accretion events. We select 46 GCs which have radii 8.0 {$<$} r {$<$} 37.3 kpc and obtain the anisotropy parameter \${\textbackslash}beta =\{0.315\}\_\{-0.049\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.055\}\$ , which is lower than the recent result using the sample of GCs in Gaia Data Release 2, but still in agreement with it by considering the error bar. By using the same sample, we obtain the MW mass inside the outermost GC as \$M( 37.3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\})=\{0.423\}\_\{-0.02\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.02\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , and the corresponding \$\{M\}\_\{200\}=\{1.11\}\_\{-0.18\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.25\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ . The estimated mass is consistent with the results in many recent studies. We also find that the estimated {$\beta$} and mass depend on the selected sample of GCs. However, it is difficult to determine whether a GC fully traces the potential of the MW.},

  abstract = {Wind Roche-Lobe Overflow (WRLOF) is a mass-transfer mechanism for stellar binaries wherein the wind acceleration zone of the donor star exceeds its Roche lobe radius, allowing material to be transferred to the accretor. WRLOF may explain characteristics observed in blue lurkers and blue stragglers, such as their fast rotation rate. While WRLOF has been implemented in rapid population synthesis codes, it has yet to be explored thoroughly in detailed binary models such as MESA, and over a wide range of initial binary configurations. We incorporate WRLOF accretion in MESA using the POSYDON infrastructure and investigate wide low-mass binaries at solar metallicity, and perform a parameter study over initial orbital period and star mass. In most of the models where we consider angular momentum transfer during accretion, the accretor is spun up to the critical rotation rate and develops a boosted wind. Balanced by boosted wind loss, the accretor only gains \${\textbackslash}sim 2{\textbackslash}\%\$ of its total mass due to wind accretion, but can maintain a near-critical rotation rate during WRLOF. Notably, the mass transfer efficiency is significantly smaller than in previous studies in which the rotation of the accretor star is ignored. We compare our results to observational data of blue lurkers in M67 and find that the WRLOF mechanism can qualitatively explain their rapid rotation speed, their location on the HR diagram and their orbital periods.},

The general properties of the halo-cluster system inferred from the abundance results are examined. It is found that the distribution over abundance of the halo globular clusters is independent of galactocentric distance for distances exceeding 8 kpc and that the clusters exhibit differences in the morphology of their color-magnitude diagrams that are uncorrelated with metal abundance. The characteristics of the system of halo clusters are compared with implications of some simple conceptual schemes for the formation of the Galaxy. It is suggested that the halo clusters originated within transient protogalactic fragments that gradually lost gas while undergoing chemical evolution and continued to fall into the Galaxy after the collapse of its central regions had been completed.},

  abstract = {Owing to the recent identification of major substructures in our Milky Way (MW), the astronomical community has started to reevaluate the importance of dissolved and existing dwarf galaxies. In this work, we investigate up to 13 elements in 43 giant stars of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy (Scl) using high-signal-to-noise-ratio near-infrared (NIR) APOGEE spectra. Thanks to the strong feature lines in the NIR, we were able to determine high-resolution O, Si, and Al abundances for a large group of sample stars for the first time in Scl. By comparing the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] (i.e., O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) of the stars in Scl, Sagittarius, and the MW, we confirm the general trend that less massive galaxies tend to show lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe]. The low [Al/Fe] ({$\sim$} - 0.5) in Scl demonstrates the value of this ratio as a discriminator with which to identify stars born in dwarf galaxies (from MW field stars). A chemical-evolution model suggests that Scl has a top-light initial mass function (IMF), with a high-mass IMF power index of {$\sim$} - 2.7, and a minimum Type Ia supernovae delay time of {$\sim$}100 Myr. Furthermore, a linear regression analysis indicates a negative radial metallicity gradient and positive radial gradients for [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe], in qualitative agreement with the outside-in formation scenario.},

In particular, we show that a major merger of two building block galaxies with 3900 M {$\odot$} and 7500 M {$\odot$} at the cosmic age of 510 Myr results in a system with an extended stellar distribution consistent with the de Vaucouleurs profile. The simulated galaxy has an average stellar metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.7 and features a metallicity gradient. These results closely resemble the properties of a recently discovered UFD, Tucana II, which is extremely metal-poor and has a spatially extended stellar halo with the more distant stars being more metal-poor. Our simulation suggests that the extended stellar halo of Tucana II may have been formed through a past major merger. Future observational searches for spatially extended structures around other UFDs, combined with further theoretical studies, will provide tangible measures of the evolutionary history of the ancient, surviving satellite galaxies.},

RR Lyrae stars can be used to identify the extent of these structures, taking advantage of the minimization of foreground contamination they provide. In this work we use RR Lyrae stars obtained from Gaia DR3, the Dark Energy Survey, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and Pan-STARRS1 to explore the outskirts of 45 ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. We associate the stars with a host galaxy based on their angular separations, magnitudes, and proper motions. We find a total of 120 RR Lyrae stars that belong to 21 different galaxies in our sample. We report seven new RR Lyrae stars in six ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (Hydrus I, Ursa Major I, Ursa Major II, Grus II, Eridanus II, and Tucana II). We found a large number of new possible members in Bootes I and Bootes III as well, but some of them may actually belong to the nearby Sagittarius stream. Adding to our list of 120 RR Lyrae stars the observations of other ultrafaint dwarf galaxies that were beyond the reach of our search, we find that at least 10 of these galaxies have RR Lyrae stars located at distances greater than four times their respective half-light radius, which implies that at least 33\% of the 30 ultrafaint dwarfs with a population of RR Lyrae stars have extended stellar populations.},

  abstract = {Context. The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey will observe a large sample of clusters and cluster stars, covering a wide age-distance-metallicity-position-density parameter space. Aims: We aim to determine C, N, and O abundances in stars of Galactic open clusters of the Gaia-ESO survey and to compare the observed abundances with those predicted by current stellar and Galactic evolution models. In this pilot paper, we investigate the first three intermediate-age open clusters. Methods: High-resolution spectra, observed with the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph on the ESO VLT, were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method. Abundances of carbon were derived using the C2 band heads at 5135 and 5635.5 {\AA}. The wavelength interval 6470-6490 {\AA}, with CN features, was analysed to determine nitrogen abundances. Oxygen abundances were determined from the [O i] line at 6300 {\AA}. Results: The mean values of the elemental abundances in Trumpler 20 as determined from 42 stars are: [ Fe/H ] = 0.10 {\textpm} 0.08 (s.d.), [ C/H ] = -0.10 {\textpm} 0.07, [ N/H ] = 0.50 {\textpm} 0.07, and consequently C/N = 0.98 {\textpm} 0.12. We measure from five giants in NGC 4815: [ Fe/H ] = -0.01 {\textpm} 0.04, [ C/H ] = -0.17 {\textpm} 0.08, [ N/H ] = 0.53 {\textpm} 0.07, [ O/H ] = 0.12 {\textpm} 0.09, and C/N = 0.79 {\textpm} 0.08. We obtain from 27 giants in NGC 6705: [ Fe/H ] = 0.0 {\textpm} 0.05, [ C/H ] = -0.08 {\textpm} 0.06, [ N/H ] = 0.61 {\textpm} 0.07, [ O/H ] = 0.13 {\textpm} 0.05, and C/N = 0.83 {\textpm} 0.19. The C/N ratios of stars in the investigated open clusters were compared with the ratios predicted by stellar evolutionary models. For the corresponding stellar turn-off masses from 1.9 to 3.3 M{$\odot$}, the observed C/N ratio values are very close to the predictions of standard first dredge-up models as well as to models of thermohaline extra-mixing. They are not decreased as much as predicted by the recent model in which the thermohaline- and rotation-induced extra-mixing act together. The average [O/H] abundance ratios of NGC 4815 and NGC 6705 are compared with the predictions of two Galactic chemical evolution models. The data are consistent with the evolution at the solar radius within the errors. Conclusions: The first results of CNO determinations in open clusters show the potential of the Gaia-ESO Survey to judge stellar and Galactic chemical evolution models and the validity of their physical assumptions through a homogeneous and detailed spectral analysis. Based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme ID 188.B-3002 (The Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey, PIs G. Gilmore and S. Randich).},

We use natural splines, a nonparametric modeling technique, to simultaneously fit the stream track, width, and linear density. This updated stream model allows us to improve measurements of the heliocentric distance (17.4 {\textpm} 0.1 (stat.) {\textpm}0.8 (sys.) kpc) and distance gradient (-0.009 {\textpm} 0.006 kpc deg-1) of Phoenix, which corresponds to a small change of 0.13 {\textpm} 0.09 kpc in heliocentric distance along the length of the stream. We measure linear intensity variations on degree scales, as well as deviations in the stream track on {\textasciitilde}2{$^\circ$} scales, suggesting that the stream may have been disturbed during its formation and/or evolution. We recover three peaks and one gap in linear intensity along with fluctuations in the stream track. Compared to other thin streams, the Phoenix stream shows more fluctuations and, consequently, the study of Phoenix offers a unique perspective on gravitational perturbations of stellar streams. We discuss possible sources of perturbations to Phoenix, including baryonic structures in the Galaxy and dark matter subhalos.},

The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VLT, Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of spectroscopy and imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution is the aim of this review.},

We used the ESO Wide Field Imager in conjunction with the Very Large Telescope/FLAMES spectrograph to study the properties of the resolved stellar population of Sculptor out to and beyond the tidal radius. We find that two components are discernible in the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars in our imaging and in the [Fe/H] and vhel distributions for our large sample of spectroscopic measurements. They can be generally described as a ``metal-poor'' component ([Fe/H]{$<$}-1.7) and a ``metal-rich'' component ([Fe/H]{$>$}-1.7). The metal-poor stars are more spatially extended than the metal-rich stars, and they also appear to be kinematically distinct. These results provide insight into the formation processes of small systems in the early universe and the conditions found there. Even this simplest of galaxies appears to have had a surprisingly complex early evolution. Based on FLAMES observations collected at the ESO, proposals 71.B-0641 and 171.B-0588.},

  abstract = {We present a new homogeneous survey of VLT/FLAMES LR8 line-of-sight radial velocities (vlos) for 1604 resolved red giant branch stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. In addition, we provide reliable Ca II triplet metallicities, [Fe/H], for 1339 of these stars. From this combination of new observations (2257 individual spectra) with ESO archival data (2389 spectra), we obtain the largest and most complete sample of vlos and [Fe/H] measurements for individual stars in any dwarf galaxy. Our sample includes VLT/FLAMES LR8 spectra for {$\sim$}55\% of the red giant branch stars at G {$<$} 20 from Gaia DR3, and {$>$} 70\% of the brightest stars, G {$<$} 18.75. Our spectroscopic velocities are combined with Gaia DR3 proper motions and parallax measurements for a new and more precise membership analysis. We look again at the global characteristics of Sculptor, deriving a mean metallicity of {$\langle$}[Fe/H]{$\rangle$} = -1.82 {\textpm} 0.45 and a mean line-of-sight velocity of {$\langle$}vlos{$\rangle$} = + 111.2 {\textpm} 0.25 km s-1. There is a clear metallicity gradient in Sculptor, -0.7deg dex-1, with the most metal-rich population being the most centrally concentrated. Furthermore, the most metal-poor population in Sculptor, [Fe/H]{$<$} - 2.5, appears to show kinematic properties distinct from the rest of the stellar population. Finally, we combine our results with the exquisite Gaia DR3 multi-colour photometry to further investigate the colour-magnitude diagram of the resolved stellar population in Sculptor. Our detailed analysis shows a similar global picture as previous studies, but with much more precise detail, revealing that Sculptor has more complex properties than previously thought. This survey emphasises the role of the stellar spectroscopy technique and this galaxy as a benchmark system for modelling galaxy formation and evolution on small scales.

  abstract = {The Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been challenging to study in a comprehensive way as it is highly extended on the sky, with an uncertain but large tidal radius of between 80-160 arcminutes (or 3-4kpc), and an extremely low central surface brightness of SigmaV = 26.2 mag/arcsec2. Here we present a new homogeneous survey of 41 VLT/FLAMES multi-fibre spectroscopic pointings that contain 2108 individual spectra, and combined with Gaia DR3 photometry and astrometry we present v-los measurements for 333 individual Red Giant Branch stars that are consistent with membership in the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy. In addition, we provide the metallicity, [Fe/H], determined from the two strongest CaII triplet lines, for 312 of these stars. We look again at the global characteristics of Sextans, deriving a mean line-of-sight velocity of {$<$}v-los{$>$} = +227.1km/s and a mean metallicity of {$<$}[Fe/H]{$>$} = -2.37. The metallicity distribution is clearly double peaked, with the highest peak at [Fe/H]= -2.81 and another broader peak at [Fe/H]= -2.09. Thus it appears that Sextans hosts two populations and the superposition leads to a radial variation in the mean metallicity, with the more metal rich population being centrally concentrated. In addition there is an intriguing group of 9 probable members in the outer region of Sextans at higher [Fe/H] than the mean in this region. If this group could be confirmed as members they would eliminate the metallicity gradient. We also look again at the Colour-Magnitude Diagram of the resolved stellar population in Sextans. We also look again at the relation between Sextans and the intriguingly nearby globular cluster, Pal3. The global properties of Sextans have not changed significantly compared to previous studies, but they are now more precise, and the sample of known members in the outer regions is now more complete.},

We have derived precise values of the physical conditions for each object making use of several emission line-intensity ratios.

We detect pure recombination lines (RLs) of C II and O II in several of the H II regions, permitting to derive their C/H and C/O ratios. We have derived the radial abundance gradient of O for each galaxy making use of collisionally excited lines (CELs) and RLs, as well as the C and N gradients using RLs and CELs, respectively. We obtain the first determination of the C/H gradient of NGC 300 and improve its determination in the case of M33. In both galaxies, the C/H gradients are steeper than those of O/H, leading to negative C/O gradients. Comparing with similar results for other spiral galaxies, we find a strong correlation between the slope of the C/H gradient and MV. We find that some H II regions located close to the isophotal radius (R25) of NGC 300 and M33 show C/O ratios more similar to those typical of dwarf galaxies than those of H II regions in the discs of more massive spirals. This may be related to the absence of flattening of the gradients in the external parts of NGC 300 and M33. Finally, we find very similar N/H gradients in both galaxies and a fair correlation between the slope of the N/H gradient and MV comparing with similar data for a sample of spiral galaxies.},

The data have been taken with the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the 8.2-m Very Large Telescope. The sample comprises five H II regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and four in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We measure pure recombination lines (RLs) of C II and O II in all the objects, permitting to derive the abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) for O2+, as well as their O/H, C/H and C/O ratios. We compare the ADFs with those of other H II regions in different galaxies. The results suggest a possible metallicity dependence of the ADF for the low-metallicity objects; but more uncertain for high-metallicity objects. We compare nebular and B-type stellar abundances and we find that the stellar abundances agree better with the nebular ones derived from collisionally excited lines (CELs). Comparing these results with other galaxies we observe that stellar abundances seem to agree better with the nebular ones derived from CELs in low-metallicity environments and from RLs in high-metallicity environments. The C/H, O/H and C/O ratios show almost flat radial gradients, in contrast with the spiral galaxies where such gradients are negative. We explore the chemical evolution analysing C/O versus O/H and comparing with the results of H II regions in other galaxies. The LMC seems to show a similar chemical evolution to the external zones of small spiral galaxies and the SMC behaves as a typical star-forming dwarf galaxy.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations have now shown that Population III (Pop III) stars can form in binaries and small clusters and that these stars can be in close proximity to each other. If so, they could be subject to binary interactions such as mass exchange that could profoundly alter their evolution, ionizing UV and Lyman-Werner photon emission and explosion yields, with important consequences for early cosmological reionization and chemical enrichment. Here we investigate the evolution of Pop III and extremely metal-poor binary stars with the MESA code. We find that interactions ranging from stable mass transfer to common envelope evolution can occur in these binaries for a wide range of mass ratios and initial separations. Mass transfer can nearly double UV photon yields in some of these binaries with respect to their individual stars by extending the life of the companion star, which in turn can enhance early cosmological reionization but also suppress the formation of later generations of primordial stars. Binary interactions can also have large effects on the nucleosynthetic yields of the stars by promoting or removing them into or out of mass ranges for specific SN types. We provide fits to total photon yields for the binaries in our study for use in cosmological simulations.},

  abstract = {The stellar abundance pattern of n-capture elements, such as barium, is used as a powerful tool to infer how star formation proceeded in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. It is found that the abundance correlation of barium with iron in stars belonging to dSph galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, i.e., Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor, have a feature similar to the barium-iron correlation in Galactic metal-poor stars. The common feature of these two correlations can be realized by our inhomogeneous chemical evolution model based on the supernova-driven star formation scenario if dSph stars formed from gas with a velocity dispersion of {\textasciitilde}26 km s-1. This velocity dispersion together with the stellar luminosities strongly suggest that dark matter dominated dSph galaxies. The tidal force of the Milky Way links this velocity dispersion with the currently observed value of {$<$}{\textasciitilde}10 km s-1 by stripping the dark matter in dSph galaxies. As a result, the total mass of each dSph galaxy is found to have been originally {\textasciitilde}25 times larger than at present. Our inhomogeneous chemical evolution model succeeds in reproducing the stellar [Fe/H] distribution function observed in Sextans. In this model, supernovae immediately after the end of star formation epoch can expel the remaining gas over the gravitational potential of the dSph galaxy.},

  abstract = {Digital images have revolutionized work in numerous scientific fields such as healthcare, astronomy, biology, agriculture as well as in every day life. One of the frequent tasks in applications with digital images is image classification which is a very challenging task. Major progress was made when convolution neural networks were introduced. The use of CNN has produced significant improvements in applications that require image classification. With today's technology, it is relatively simple to implement and use CNNs but in order to obtain the best possible results it is necessary to find the optimal architecture and hyperparameters for every single task. Due to a large number of hyperparameters, it is difficult to find the optimal configuration and there is no deterministic way to do it. In this early stage of CNN development, the commonConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN)~method of tuning CNN is by guessing and estimating, known as the guestimating method. Since this is a hard optimization problem, there is a chance to apply an optimization metaheuristic. There are several studies that have applied different optimization methods for tuning CNN hyperparameters have applied. One promising approach is the application of swarm intelligence algorithms. In this paper, a brief review of the CNN hyperparameters tuning will be presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the cosmic microwave background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant components. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at {\textasciitilde}7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small, and we advocate a reference frame with respect to the Local Sheet in preference to the Local Group. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km s-1 and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km s-1, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km s-1 in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into account, particularly that of the Local Void, causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. Concerning the motion of {\textasciitilde}260 km s-1 away from the Local Void, given the velocities expected from gravitational instability theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position. The Local Void is extremely large.},

Numerically the largest contributions come from the luminosity-line width correlation for spirals, the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR), and the related fundamental plane relation for E/S0 systems, but over 1000 distances are contributed by methods that provide more accurate individual distances: Cepheid, tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), surface brightness fluctuation, Type Ia supernova, and several miscellaneous but accurate procedures. Our collaboration is making important contributions to two of these inputs: TRGB and TFR. A large body of new distance material is presented. In addition, an effort is made to ensure that all the contributions, both our own and those from the literature, are on the same scale. Overall, the distances are found to be compatible with a Hubble constant H 0 = 74.4 {\textpm} 3.0 km s-1 Mpc-1. The great interest going forward with this data set will be with velocity field studies. Cosmicflows-2 is characterized by a great density and high accuracy of distance measures locally, falling to sparse and coarse sampling extending to z = 0.1.},

Mass loss from systems with a chemically homogeneous interstellar medium does not work. It is pointed out that supernova-driven winds are in fact metal-enhanced with respect to the star-forming gas because the metal production of any supernova that drives the wind is directly flushed out of the galaxy. The fraction of the total metal production lost in the wind is thus at least as large as the fraction epsilon(z) of supernovae that power the wind, independent of the total mass loss. As a corollary, the yield of heavy elements that are recycled in the galaxy is reduced by a factor 1 - epsilon(z). Metal-enhanced galactic winds, which can carry away a large fraction of the metal production in spite of a moderate total mass loss, offer a promising explanation for the low metallicities of dwarf elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present new fully self-consistent models of the formation and evolution of isolated dwarf galaxies (DGs). We have used the publicly available N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code hydra, to which we have added a set of star formation criteria, and prescriptions for chemical enrichment [taking into account contributions from both Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and Type II supernova (SN II)], supernova feedback, and gas cooling. We extensively tested the soundness of these prescriptions and the numerical convergence of the models. The models follow the evolution of an initially homogeneous gas cloud collapsing in a pre-existing dark matter (DM) halo. These simplified initial conditions are supported by the merger trees of isolated DGs extracted from the milli-Millennium Simulation. The star formation histories (SFHs) of the model galaxies exhibit burst-like behaviour. These bursts are a consequence of the blow-out and subsequent in-fall of gas. The amount of gas that leaves the galaxy for good is found to be small, in absolute numbers, ranging between 3 {\texttimes} 107 and 6 {\texttimes} 107M{$\odot$}. For the least massive models, however, this is over 80 per cent of their initial gas mass. The local fluctuations in gas density are strong enough to trigger starbursts in the massive models, or to inhibit anything more than small residual star formation (SF) for the less massive models. Between these starbursts there can be time intervals of several gigayears.The models' surface brightness profiles are well fitted by S{\'e}rsic profiles and the correlations between the models' S{\'e}rsic parameters and luminosity agree with the observations. We have also compared model predictions for the half-light radius Re, central velocity dispersion {$\sigma$}c, broad-band colour B-v, metallicity [Z/Z{$\odot$}] versus luminosity relations and for the location relative to the fundamental plane with the available data. The properties of the model DGs agree quite well with those of observed DGs. However, the properties of the most massive models deviate from those of observed galaxies. This most likely signals that galaxy mergers are starting to affect the galaxies' SFHs in this mass regime (M{$\greaterequivlnt$} 109M{$\odot$}).We found that a good way to assess the soundness of models is provided by the combination of Re and {$\sigma$}c. The demand that these are reproduced simultaneously places a stringent constraint on the spatial distribution of SF and on the shape and extent of the DM halo relative to that of the stars.},

  abstract = {We assemble a catalogue of candidate Sagittarius stream members with 5D and 6D phase-space information, using astrometric data from Gaia DR2, distances estimated from RR Lyrae stars, and line-of-sight velocities from various spectroscopic surveys. We find a clear misalignment between the stream track and the direction of the reflex-corrected proper motions in the leading arm of the stream, which we interpret as a signature of a time-dependent perturbation of the gravitational potential. A likely cause of this perturbation is the recent passage of the most massive Milky Way satellite - the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We develop novel methods for simulating the Sagittarius stream in the presence of the LMC, using specially tailored N-body simulations and a flexible parametrization of the Milky Way halo density profile. We find that while models without the LMC can fit most stream features rather well, they fail to reproduce the misalignment and overestimate the distance to the leading arm apocentre. On the other hand, models with an LMC mass in the range \$(1.3{\textbackslash}pm 0.3){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ rectify these deficiencies. We demonstrate that the stream can not be modelled adequately in a static Milky Way. Instead, our Galaxy is required to lurch toward the massive in-falling Cloud, giving the Sgr stream its peculiar shape and kinematics. By exploring the parameter space of Milky Way potentials, we determine the enclosed mass within 100 kpc to be \$(5.6{\textbackslash}pm 0.4){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ , and the virial mass to be \$(9.0{\textbackslash}pm 1.3){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ , and find tentative evidence for a radially-varying shape and orientation of the Galactic halo.},

We measure the mean parallaxes and proper motions (PM) for 170 clusters, determine the PM dispersion profiles for more than 100 clusters, uncover rotation signatures in more than 20 objects, and find evidence for radial or tangential PM anisotropy in a dozen richest clusters. At the same time, we use the selection of cluster members to explore the reliability and limitations of the Gaia catalogue itself. We find that the formal uncertainties on parallax and PM are underestimated by \$10\{-\}20\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ in dense central regions even for stars that pass numerous quality filters. We explore the spatial covariance function of systematic errors, and determine a lower limit on the uncertainty of average parallaxes and PM at the level 0.01 mas and 0.025 mas yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ , respectively. Finally, a comparison of mean parallaxes of clusters with distances from various literature sources suggests that the parallaxes for stars with \$G{$>$}13\$ (after applying the zero-point correction suggested by Lindegren et al.) are overestimated by \${\textbackslash}sim 0.01{\textbackslash}pm 0.003\$ mas. Despite these caveats, the quality of Gaia astrometry has been significantly improved in EDR3 and provides valuable insights into the properties of star clusters.},

An emerging picture is that the LMC is a fairly massive companion (10--20\% of the Milky Way mass) and just passed the pericentre of its orbit, likely for the first time. The gravitational perturbation caused by the LMC is manifested at different levels. The most immediate effect is the deflection of orbits of stars, stellar streams, or satellite galaxies passing in the vicinity of the LMC. Less well known but equally important is the displacement (reflex motion) of central regions of the Milky Way about the centre of mass of both galaxies. Since the Milky Way is not a rigid body, this displacement varies with the distance from the LMC, and as a result, the Galaxy is deformed and its outer regions (beyond a few tens kpc) acquire a net velocity with respect to its centre. These phenomena need to be taken into account at the level of precision warranted by current and future observational data, and improvements on the modelling side are also necessary for an adequate interpretation of these data.},

Using a series of tailored N-body simulations, we demonstrate that such orbits are consistent with current observational constraints on the mass distribution and relative velocity of both galaxies. The previous pericentre passage of the LMC could have occurred 5-10 Gyr ago at a distance {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100 kpc, large enough to retain its current population of satellites. The perturbations of the Milky Way halo induced by the LMC look nearly identical to the first-passage scenario, however, the distribution of LMC debris is considerably broader in the second-passage model. We examine the likelihood of current and past association with the Magellanic system for dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, and find that in addition to 10-11 current LMC satellites, it could have brought a further four to six galaxies that have been lost after the first pericentre passage. In particular, four of the classical dwarfs - Carina, Draco, Fornax, and Ursa Minor - each have an {\textasciitilde}50 per cent probability of once belonging to the Magellanic system, thus providing a possible explanation for the 'plane of satellites' conundrum.},

However, the galaxy must be on a relatively short-period orbit with a pericentre of about 10 kpc and an apocentre of about 52 kpc, giving a current transverse velocity of 255 km s{\textasciicircum}-1 and a period of {\textasciitilde}760 Myr. Furthermore, disruption must have occurred predominantly on the last pericentric passage rather than on the present one. The data are consistent with transverse motion either towards or away from the Galactic plane.

For velocity-dependent annihilation cross sections, we compute emissions from simulated Sgr subhalos and from the Milky Way (MW) foreground. In addition to the annihilation signals from DM particles bound to Sgr, we consider for the first time the annihilation of DM particles bound to the MW that overlap spatially with Sgr. For p-wave models this contribution can enhance the signal by over an order of magnitude, while for d-wave models the enhancement can be over three orders of magnitude. For Sommerfeld and s-wave models, the corresponding emission does not significantly change. For the Sommerfeld model, the Sgr source can be visible above the MW foreground emission, while for s, p and d-wave models, the signal towards Sgr is most likely dominated by foreground MW emission. We interpret our results within the context of the observed gamma-ray emission from Sgr. We find that, given the background emission estimated from this region, the templates from simulations likely have spatial morphology that is too extended to explain the point-like emission that is observed.},

Using a sample of \${\textbackslash}sim 5100\$ stars with elemental abundances from APOGEE and asteroseismic masses from \{{\textbackslash}it Kepler\}, we test theoretical stellar models that predict this mixing, then apply these models to derive birth C, N, and O abundances for these stars. Our models with standard mixing can reproduce the observed trends to within plausible uncertainties in the birth abundances. Some models with ''extra'' mixing processes fail, predicting trends with surface gravity or evolutionary state that are not observed. Applying mixing corrections to the APOGEE abundances removes the observed age-dependence of log(N/O) and log(C/N), but it leaves trends of log(N/O) and log(C/N) with metallicity, as expected based on nucleosynthesis models. The stellar N/O trend agrees well with Dopita et al.'s calibration of gas phase log(N/O) with metallicity, and with gas phase trends in the MaNGA integral field survey of nearby galaxies. We also find a substantial separation in birth [N/Mg] ratios between high-[\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] (''thick disc'') stars and low-[\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] (''thin disc'') stars. We find a smaller but still clear separation for [C/Mg]. The trends of birth C and N abundances with [Fe/H] and [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] could affect spectroscopic age estimates for red giants that rely on the observed C/N ratio as a diagnostic of stellar mass.},

  abstract = {Determination of the mass density profiles of dwarf galaxies (and specifically whether there is a central core or cusp) provides a critical test of both the properties of dark matter (DM) and the physics of cosmological structure formation. The Milky Way nearby classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) provide some of the best dynamical constraints. While large line-of-sight velocity datasets exist (some thousand stars per galaxy), interpretation is hindered by the well-known mass vs. velocity-anisotropy degeneracy of stellar dynamics. This can be resolved with proper motion (PM) measurements that yield 3-D velocity information. This is well beyond the reach of Gaia, given the small velocity dispersions of dSphs and the absence of bright stars. HST is the only observatory that can advance this problem, given its combination of photometric depth, high spatial resolution, and long time baselines. We propose to obtain HST imaging of eight previously imaged fields (four prime plus four parallels) in the nearby Ursa Minor dSph, to obtain high-accuracy PMs for thousands of stars in this galaxy. This unique data set will provide a direct determination of the velocity anisotropy profile. Through detailed dynamical modeling, this will constrain the DM density cusp slope with an uncertainty of only 0.1, allowing us to discriminate at 10-sigma confidence between a core or NFW cusp. The results will give unique constraints on both the nature of DM, and the physical mechanisms that shape DM density profiles in galaxies. The proposed program therefore shows how HST can still be used, after 33 years in orbit, to tackle unanswered fundamental questions in astrophysics.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. {$<$}i/{$>$}In spite of enormous progress and brilliant achievements in cosmological simulations, they still lack numerical resolution or physical processes to simulate dwarf galaxies in sufficient detail. Accurate numerical simulations of individual dwarf galaxies are thus still in demand.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}We aim to improve available numerical techniques to simulate individual dwarf galaxies. In particular, we aim to (i) study in detail the coupling between stars and gas in a galaxy, exploiting the so-called stellar hydrodynamical approach; and (ii) study for the first time the chemodynamical evolution of individual galaxies starting from self-consistently calculated initial gas distributions.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We present a novel chemodynamical code for studying the evolution of individual dwarf galaxies. In this code, the dynamics of gas is computed using the usual hydrodynamics equations, while the dynamics of stars is described by the stellar hydrodynamics approach, which solves for the first three moments of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. The feedback from stellar winds and dying stars is followed in detail. In particular, a novel and detailed approach has been developed to trace the aging of various stellar populations, which facilitates an accurate calculation of the stellar feedback depending on the stellar age. The code has been accurately benchmarked, allowing us to provide a recipe for improving the code performance on the Sedov test problem. \emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We build initial equilibrium models of dwarf galaxies that take gas self-gravity into account and present different levels of rotational support. Models with high rotational support (and hence high degrees of flattening) develop prominent bipolar outflows; a newly-born stellar population in these models is preferentially concentrated to the galactic midplane. Models with little rotational support blow away a large fraction of the gas and the resulting stellar distribution is extended and diffuse. Models that start from non-self-gravitating initial equilibrium configurations, evolve at a much slower pace owing to lower initial gas density and hence lower star formation rates. The stellar dynamics turns out to be a crucial aspect of galaxy evolution. If we artificially suppress stellar dynamics, supernova explosions occur in a medium that is heated and diluted by previous activity of stellar winds, thus artificially enhancing stellar feedback.\emph{Conclusions. {$<$}i/{$>$}The stellar hydrodynamics approach presents a promising tool for numerically studying the coupled evolution of gas and stars in dwarf galaxies.}}}}}},

The stellar density maps are derived, hinting that Sculptor possesses tidal tails indicating interaction with the Milky Way. Contrary to previous studies we cannot find any sign of breaks in the density profiles for the Carina and Fornax dwarfs. The possible existence of tidal tails in Sculptor and of King limiting radii in Fornax and Carina are used to derive global M/L ratios, without using kinematic data. By matching those M/L ratios to kinematically derived values we are able to constrain the orbital parameters of the three dwarfs. Fornax cannot have M/L smaller than 3 and must be close to its perigalacticon now. The other extreme is Sculptor that needs to be on an orbit with an eccentricity bigger than 0.5 to be able to form tidal tails despite its kinematic M/L.},

  abstract = {We introduce a stellar velocity survey of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, undertaken using the Michigan/MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) at the Magellan/Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. As of 2006 November we have used MMFS to collect 6415 high-resolution (R=20,000-25,000) spectra from 5180 stars in four dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans. Spectra sample the range 5140-5180 {\AA}, which includes the prominent magnesium triplet absorption feature. We measure radial velocity (RV) to a median precision of 2.0 km s-1 for stars as faint as V{\textasciitilde}20.5. From the spectra we also are able to measure the strength of iron and magnesium absorption features using spectral indices that correlate with effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical abundance. Measurement of line strength allows us to identify interloping foreground stars independently of velocity and to examine the metallicity distribution among dSph members. Here we present detailed descriptions of MMFS, our target selection and spectroscopic observations, the data reduction procedure, and error analysis. We compare our RV results to previously published measurements for individual stars. In some cases we find evidence for a mild, velocity-dependent offset between the RVs that we measure using the magnesium triplet and previously published RV measurements derived from the infrared calcium triplet. In companion papers we will present the complete data sets and kinematic analyses of these new observations. This paper includes data obtained with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

  abstract = {We develop an algorithm for estimating parameters of a distribution sampled with contamination. We employ a statistical technique known as "expectation maximization" (EM). Given models for both member and contaminant populations, the EM algorithm iteratively evaluates the membership probability of each discrete data point, then uses those probabilities to update parameter estimates for member and contaminant distributions. The EM approach has wide applicability to the analysis of astronomical data. Here we tailor an EM algorithm to operate on spectroscopic samples obtained with the Michigan-MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) as part of our Magellan survey of stellar radial velocities in nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. These samples, to be presented in a companion paper, contain discrete measurements of line-of-sight velocity, projected position, and pseudo-equivalent width of the Mg-triplet feature, for {\textasciitilde}1000-2500 stars per dSph, including some fraction of contamination by foreground Milky Way stars. The EM algorithm uses all of the available data to quantify dSph and contaminant distributions. For distributions (e.g., velocity and Mg-index of dSph stars) assumed to be Gaussian, the EM algorithm returns maximum-likelihood estimates of the mean and variance, as well as the probability that each star is a dSph member. These probabilities can serve as weights in subsequent analyses. Applied to our MMFS data, the EM algorithm identifies more than 5000 stars as probable dSph members. We test the performance of the EM algorithm on simulated data sets that represent a range of sample size, level of contamination, and amount of overlap between dSph and contaminant velocity distributions. The simulations establish that for samples ranging from large (N {\textasciitilde} 3000, characteristic of the MMFS samples) to small (N {\textasciitilde} 30), resembling new samples for extremely faint dSphs), the EM algorithm distinguishes members from contaminants and returns accurate parameter estimates much more reliably than conventional methods of contaminant removal (e.g., sigma clipping).},

  abstract = {We apply the Jeans equation to estimate masses for eight of the brightest dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. For Fornax, the dSph with the largest kinematic data set, we obtain a model-independent constraint on the maximum circular velocity, V max = 20+4 -3 km s-1. Although we obtain only lower limits of V max {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 10 km s-1 for the remaining dSphs, we find that in all cases the enclosed mass at the projected half-light radius is well constrained and robust to a wide range of halo models and velocity anisotropies. We derive a simple analytic formula that estimates M(r half) accurately with respect to results from the full Jeans analysis. Applying this formula to the entire population of Local Group dSphs with published kinematic data, we demonstrate a correlation such that M(r half) vprop r 1.4{\textpm}0.4 half, or in terms of the mean density interior to the half-light radius, lang{$\rho$}rang vprop r -1.6{\textpm}0.4 half. This relation is driven by the fact that the dSph data exhibit a correlation between global velocity dispersion and half-light radius. We argue that tidal forces are unlikely to have introduced this relation, but tides may have increased the scatter and/or altered the slope. While the data are well described by mass profiles ranging over a factor of lsim2 in normalization (V max {\textasciitilde} 10-20 km s-1), we consider the hypothesis that all dSphs are embedded within a "universal" dark matter halo. We show that in addition to the power law M vprop r 1.4, viable candidates include a cuspy "Navarro-Frenk-White" halo with V max {\textasciitilde} 15 km s-1 and scale radius r 0 {\textasciitilde} 800 pc, as well as a cored halo with V max {\textasciitilde} 13 km s-1 and r 0 {\textasciitilde} 150 pc. Finally, assuming that their measured velocity dispersions accurately reflect their masses, the smallest dSphs now allow us to resolve dSph densities at radii as small as a few tens of pc. At these small scales, we find mean densities as large as lang{$\rho$}rang {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 5 M sun pc-3 (lsim200 GeV cm-3).

  abstract = {We introduce a method for measuring the slopes of mass profiles within dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies directly from stellar spectroscopic data and without adopting a dark matter halo model. Our method combines two recent results: (1) spherically symmetric, equilibrium Jeans models imply that the product of half-light radius and (squared) stellar velocity dispersion provides an estimate of the mass enclosed within the half-light radius of a dSph stellar component, and (2) some dSphs have chemodynamically distinct stellar subcomponents that independently trace the same gravitational potential. We devise a statistical method that uses measurements of stellar positions, velocities, and spectral indices to distinguish two dSph stellar subcomponents and to estimate their individual half-light radii and velocity dispersions. For a dSph with two detected stellar subcomponents, we obtain estimates of masses enclosed at two discrete points in the same mass profile, immediately defining a slope. Applied to published spectroscopic data, our method distinguishes stellar subcomponents in the Fornax and Sculptor dSphs, for which we measure slopes {$\Gamma$} {$\equiv$} {$\Delta$}log M/{$\Delta$}log r = 2.61+0.43 -0.37 and {$\Gamma$} = 2.95+0.51 -0.39, respectively. These values are consistent with "cores" of constant density within the central few hundred parsecs of each galaxy and rule out "cuspy" Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles (dlog M/dlog r {$<$}= 2 at all radii) with a significance {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 96\% and {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 99\%, respectively. Tests with synthetic data indicate that our method tends systematically to overestimate the mass of the inner stellar subcomponent to a greater degree than that of the outer stellar subcomponent, and therefore to underestimate the slope {$\Gamma$} (implying that the stated NFW exclusion levels are conservative).},

  abstract = {Globular clusters are some of the oldest bound stellar structures observed in the Universe1. They are ubiquitous in large galaxies and are believed to trace intense star-formation events and the hierarchical build-up of structure2,3. Observations of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and a wide variety of other galaxies, have found evidence for a `metallicity floor', whereby no globular clusters are found with chemical (metal) abundances below approximately 0.3 to 0.4 per cent of that of the Sun4--6. The existence of this metallicity floor may reflect a minimum mass and a maximum redshift for surviving globular clusters to form---both critical components for understanding the build-up of mass in the Universe7. Here we report measurements from the Southern Stellar Streams Spectroscopic Survey of the spatially thin, dynamically cold Phoenix stellar stream in the halo of the Milky Way. The properties of the Phoenix stream are consistent with it being the tidally disrupted remains of a globular cluster. However, its metal abundance ([Fe/H]~=~-2.7) is substantially below the empirical metallicity floor. The Phoenix stream thus represents the debris of the most metal-poor globular clusters discovered so far, and its progenitor is distinct from the present-day globular cluster population in the local Universe. Its existence implies that globular clusters below the metallicity floor have probably existed, but were destroyed during Galactic evolution.},

We identify simulated satellites that match the observed spatial and kinematic distributions of stars in these galaxies, and track their evolution after infall. We find {$\sim$}30 per cent of subhaloes hosting satellites with present-day stellar mass 106-108 M{$\odot$} experience {$>$}20 per cent stellar mass-loss after infall. Fornax analogues have earlier infall times compared to Sculptor and Leo I analogues. Star formation in Fornax analogues continues for {$\sim$}3-6 Gyr after infall, whereas Sculptor and Leo I analogues stop forming stars {$<$}2-3 Gyr after infall. Fornax analogues typically show more significant stellar mass-loss and exhibit stellar tidal tails, whereas Sculptor and Leo I analogues, which are more deeply embedded in their host dark matter haloes at infall, do not show substantial mass-loss due to tides. When additionally comparing the orbital motion of the host subaloes to the measured proper motion of Fornax, we find the matching more difficult; host subhaloes tend to have pericentres smaller than that measured for Fornax itself. From the kinematic and orbital data, we estimate that Fornax has lost 10-20 per cent of its infall stellar mass. Our best estimate for the surface brightness of a stellar tidal stream associated with Fornax is {$\Sigma$} {$\sim$} 32.6 mag arcsec-2, which may be detectable with deep imaging surveys such as DES and LSST.},

  abstract = {Using deep wide-field photometry 3 yr data (Y3) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we present a panoramic study of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The data presented here---a small subset of the full survey---uniformly cover a region of 25 deg2 centered on the galaxy to a depth of g {$\sim$} 23.5. We use these data to study the structural properties of Fornax, overall stellar population, and its member stars in different evolutionary phases. We also search for possible signs of tidal disturbance. Fornax is found to be significantly more spatially extended than what early studies suggested. No statistically significant distortions or signs of tidal disturbances were found down to a surface brightness limit of {$\sim$}32.1 mag arcsec-2. However, there are hints of shell-like features located {$\sim$}20--40- from the center of Fornax that may be stellar debris from past merger events. We also find that intermediate-age and young main-sequence populations show different orientation at the galaxy center and have many substructures. The deep DES Y3 data allow us to characterize the age of those young stellar substructures with great accuracy, both those previously known and those newly identified as possible overdensities in this work, on the basis of their color-magnitude diagram morphology. We find that the youngest overdensities are all found on the eastern side of Fornax, where the Fornax field population itself is slightly younger than in the west. In summary, the high-quality DES Y3 data reveal that Fornax has many rich structures and provide insights into its complex formation history.},

  abstract = {We perform an extensive review of the numerous studies and methods used to determine the total mass of the Milky Way. We group the various studies into seven broad classes according to their modeling approaches. The classes include: i) estimating Galactic escape velocity using high velocity objects; ii) measuring the rotation curve through terminal and circular velocities; iii) modeling halo stars, globular clusters and satellite galaxies with the spherical Jeans equation and iv) with phase-space distribution functions; v) simulating and modeling the dynamics of stellar streams and their progenitors; vi) modeling the motion of the Milky Way, M31 and other distant satellites under the framework of Local Group timing argument; and vii) measurements made by linking the brightest Galactic satellites to their counterparts in simulations. For each class of methods, we introduce their theoretical and observational background, the method itself, the sample of available tracer objects, model assumptions, uncertainties, limits and the corresponding measurements that have been achieved in the past. Both the measured total masses within the radial range probed by tracer objects and the extrapolated virial masses are discussed and quoted. We also discuss the role of modern numerical simulations in terms of helping to validate model assumptions, understanding systematic uncertainties and calibrating the measurements. While measurements in the last two decades show a factor of two scatters, recent measurements using Gaia DR2 data are approaching a higher precision. We end with a detailed discussion of future developments in the field, especially as the size and quality of the observational data will increase tremendously with current and future surveys. In such cases, the systematic uncertainties will be dominant and thus will necessitate a much more rigorous testing and characterization of the various mass determination methods.},

  abstract = {Deriving stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from stellar spectra is crucial for understanding the evolution of the Milky Way. By performing a fitting with MARCS model atmospheric theoretical synthetic spectra combined with a domain-adaptation method, we estimate the fundamental stellar parameters (T eff, log g, [Fe/H], v mic, and v mac) and 11 chemical abundances for 1.38 million FGKM-type stars of the Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS) from LAMOST-II DR8. The domain-adaptation method, CYCLE-STARNET, is employed to reduce the gap between observed and synthetic spectra, and the L-BFGS algorithm is used to search the best-fit synthetic spectra. By combining the Two Micron All Sky Survey photometric survey data, Gaia EDR3 parallax, and MIST isochrones, the surface gravities of the stars are constrained after estimating their bolometric luminosities. The accuracy of T eff, log g, and [Fe/H] can reach 150 K, 0.11 dex, and 0.15 dex, evaluated by the PASTEL catalog, asteroseismic samples, and other spectroscopic surveys. The precision of these parameters and elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Cr/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Co/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cu/Fe]) is assessed by repeated observations and validated by cluster members. For spectra with signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) greater than 10, the precision of the three stellar parameters and elemental abundances can achieve 76 K, 0.014 dex, 0.096 dex, and 0.04-0.15 dex. For spectra with S/Ns higher than 100, the precision stabilizes at 22 K, 0.006 dex, 0.043 dex, and 0.01-0.06 dex.

  abstract = {Wide-area deep imaging surveys have discovered large numbers of extremely low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies, which challenge galaxy formation theory and, potentially, offer new constraints on the nature of dark matter. Here we discuss one as-yet-unexplored formation mechanism that may account for a fraction of LSB dwarfs. We call this the "ghost galaxy" scenario. In this scenario, inefficient radiative cooling prevents star formation in the "main branch" of the merger tree of a low-mass dark matter halo, such that almost all its stellar mass is acquired through mergers with less massive (but nevertheless star-forming) progenitors. Present-day systems formed in this way would be "ghostly" isolated stellar halos with no central galaxy. We use merger trees based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and the Copernicus Complexio cosmological N-body simulation to demonstrate that mass assembly histories of this kind can occur for low-mass halos in {$\Lambda$}CDM, but they are rare. They are most probable in isolated halos of present-day mass {\textasciitilde}4 {\texttimes} 109 M {$\odot$}, occurring for {\textasciitilde}5\% of all halos of that mass under standard assumptions about the timing and effect of cosmic reionization. The stellar masses of star-forming progenitors in these systems are highly uncertain; abundance-matching arguments imply a bimodal present-day mass function having a brighter population (median M {$\star$} {\textasciitilde} 3 {\texttimes} 106 M {$\odot$}) consistent with the tail of the observed luminosity function of ultradiffuse galaxies. This suggests that observable analogs of these systems may await discovery. We find that a stronger ionizing background (globally or locally) produces brighter and more extended ghost galaxies.},

  abstract = {The discovery of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in globular clusters (GCs) raises the possibility of long-term retention of BHs within GCs. These BHs influence various astrophysical processes, including merger-driven gravitational waves and the formation of X-ray binaries. They also impact cluster dynamics by heating and creating low-density cores. Previous N-body models suggested that Palomar 5, a low-density GC with long tidal tails, may contain more than 100 BHs. To test this scenario, we conduct N-body simulations of Palomar 5 with primordial binaries to explore the influence of BHs on binary populations and the stellar mass function. Our results show that primordial binaries have minimal effect on the long-term evolution. In dense clusters with BHs, the fraction of wide binaries with periods {$>$}105 d decreases, and the disruption rate is independent of the initial period distribution. Multi-epoch spectroscopic observations of line-of-sight velocity changes can detect most bright binaries with periods below 104 d, significantly improving velocity dispersion measurements. Four BH-MS binaries in the model with BHs suggests their possible detection through the same observation method. Including primordial binaries leads to a flatter inferred mass function because of spatially unresolved binaries, leading to a better match of the observations than models without binaries, particularly in Palomar 5's inner region. Future observations should focus on the cluster velocity dispersion and binaries with periods of 104-105 d in Palomar 5's inner and tail regions to constrain BH existence.},

  abstract = {Most Milky Way dwarf galaxies are much less bound to their host than are relics of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus and Sgr. These dwarfs are expected to have fallen into the Galactic halo less than 3 Gyr ago, and will therefore have undergone no more than one full orbit. Here, we have performed hydrodynamical simulations of this process, assuming that their progenitors are gas-rich, rotation-supported dwarfs. We follow their transformation through interactions with the hot corona and gravitational field of the galaxy. Our dedicated simulations reproduce the structural properties of three dwarf galaxies: Sculptor, Antlia II, and with somewhat a lower accuracy, Crater II. This includes reproducing their large velocity dispersions, which are caused by ram-pressure stripping and Galactic tidal shocks. Differences between dwarfs can be interpreted as due to different orbital paths, as well as to different initial conditions for their progenitor gas and stellar contents. However, we failed to suppress in a single orbit the rotational support of our Sculptor analogue if it is fully dark matter dominated. In addition, we have found that classical dwarf galaxies like Sculptor may have stellar cores sufficiently dense to survive the pericentre passage through adiabatic contraction. On the contrary, our Antlia II and Crater II analogues are tidally stripped, explaining their large sizes, extremely low surface brightnesses, and velocity dispersion. This modelling explains differences between dwarf galaxies by reproducing them as being at different stages of out-of-equilibrium stellar systems.},

  abstract = {The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been remarkably successful in explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it has faced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regions of dark matter halos and the properties of the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy satellites. We review the current observational and theoretical status of these "small-scale controversies." Cosmological simulations that incorporate only gravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and central densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics. The solution could lie in baryonic physics: Recent numerical simulations and analytical models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to efficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive galaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star formation efficiency could explain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host visible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the lowest mass galaxies, where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the small-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark sector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter self-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good agreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational lensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo provide evidence for an abundant population of low-mass subhalos in accord with CDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the next few years.},

For a plateau at [{$\alpha$}/Fe]cc = 0.45, we find that the population-averaged yields of O and Mg are about equal to the solar abundance of these elements, logyOcc/ZO,{$\odot$}=logyMgcc/ZMg,{$\odot$}=-0.01{\textpm}0.1 , where yXcc is the mass of element X produced by massive stars per unit mass of star formation. The inferred O and Fe yields agree with predictions of the Sukhbold et al. CCSN models assuming their Z9.6+N20 neutrino-driven engine, a scenario in which many progenitors with M {$<$} 40M {$\odot$} implode to black holes rather than exploding. The yields are lower than assumed in many models of the galaxy mass--metallicity relation, reducing the level of outflows needed to match observed abundances. Our one-zone chemical evolution models with {$\eta$}={\.M}out/{\.M}*{$\approx$}0.6 evolve to solar metallicity at late times. By further requiring that models reach [{$\alpha$}/Fe] {$\approx$} 0 at late times, we infer a Hubble-time integrated Type Ia supernova rate of 1.1{\texttimes}10-3M{$\odot$}-1 , compatible with estimates from supernova surveys.},

We infer a limit log10, 12C/13C {$>$} +0.37 (2{$\sigma$}). We use the abundance pattern of this DLA, combined with a stochastic chemical enrichment model, to infer the properties of the enriching stars, finding the total gas mass of this system to be log10(Mgas/M{$\odot$})= 6.3+1.4-0.9 and the total stellar mass to be log10(M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$}) = 4.8 {\textpm} 1.3. The current observations disfavour enrichment by metal-poor asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses {$<$} 2.4 M{$\odot$}, limiting the epoch at which this DLA formed most of its enriching stars. Our modelling suggests that this DLA formed very few stars until {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 Gyr after the cosmic reionization of hydrogen and, despite its very low metallicity ({$\sim$} 1/1000 of solar), this DLA appears to have formed most of its stars in the past few hundred Myr. Combining the inferred star formation history with evidence that some of the most metal-poor DLAs display an elevated [C/O] ratio at redshift z {$\lessequivlnt$} 3, we suggest that very metal-poor DLAs may have been affected by reionization quenching. Finally, given the simplicity and quiescence of the absorption features associated with the DLA studied here, we use these ESPRESSO data to place a bound on the possible variability of the fine-structure constant, {$\Delta\alpha$}/{$\alpha$} = (-1.2 {\textpm} 1.1) {\texttimes} 10-5.},

Prior observations indicate that the [O/Fe] ratio is consistent with a constant value, [O/Fe] {$\simeq$} +0.4, when -3 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} -2, but this ratio may increase when [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -3. In this paper, we test this picture by reporting new, high-precision [O/Fe] abundances in two of the most metal-poor DLAs currently known. We derive values of [O/Fe] = +0.50 {\textpm} 0.10 and [O/Fe] = +0.62 {\textpm} 0.05 for these two z {$\simeq$} 3 near-pristine gas clouds. These results strengthen the idea that the [O/Fe] abundances of the most metal-poor DLAs are elevated compared to DLAs with [Fe/H] {$\greaterequivlnt$} -3. We compare the observed abundance pattern of the latter system to the nucleosynthetic yields of Population III supernovae (SNe), and find that the enrichment can be described by a (19-25) M{$\odot$} Population III SN that underwent a (0.9-2.4) {\texttimes} 1051 erg explosion. These high-precision measurements showcase the behavior of [O/Fe] in the most metal-poor environments. Future high-precision measurements in new systems will contribute to a firm detection of the relationship between [O/Fe] and [Fe/H]. These data will reveal whether we are witnessing a chemical signature of enrichment from Population III stars and allow us to rule out contamination from Population II stars.},

  abstract = {We explore the spatial distribution of stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy over an area of 7.82 deg2, including coverage of the central region but extending mostly south and east of the dSph core. Two methods are used to identify stars that are most likely associated with the dSph, and these filtered samples of stars are used to map its spatial structure. First, following the method of previous contributions in this series, we utilize Washington M, T2+DDO51 photometry to identify red giant branch (RGB) star candidates with approximately the same distance and metallicity as the Sculptor dSph. Second, a prominent blue horizontal branch (BHB) population provides a fairly populous and pure sample of Sculptor stars having broadband colors unlike the bulk of the Galactic field star population. A spectroscopically observed subset of Sculptor candidate stars (147 total stars: {\textasciitilde}5\% of all Sculptor candidates and {\textasciitilde}10\% of Sculptor giant candidates) yields a systemic heliocentric velocity for the system of vhel=110.43+/-0.79 km s-1, in good agreement with previous studies. We also find a global velocity dispersion of {$\sigma$}v=8.8+/-0.6 km s-1, with slight indications of a rise in the velocity dispersion past {\textasciitilde}0.4rlim. These spectra also provide a check on the reliability of our candidate Sculptor giant sample to M{\textasciitilde}19 94\% of the photometrically selected Sculptor giant star candidates with follow-up spectroscopy are found to be kinematically associated with Sculptor, while 4 out of 10 stars outside of our Sculptor giant star selection criteria that we tested spectroscopically appear to be velocity members of Sculptor. These percentages are in agreement with results for an additional 22 Sculptor field stars with radial velocities in the literature. All available velocities show that our methodology for picking Sculptor giants is both reliable and conservative. Thus, these giant star samples should provide a reliable means to explore the structure of the Sculptor dSph. Nevertheless, considerable care has been taken to assess the level of background contamination in our photometric sample to ensure an accurately derived density profile of the Sculptor dSph to large radii. Multiple background assessments verify that we detect a considerable stellar density of Sculptor stars to the limits of our main survey area for both the RGB and BHB candidate samples. While we find that a King profile of limiting radius rlim=79.6 arcmin fits the density profile of Sculptor well to {\textasciitilde}60', beyond this, we identify a ``break'' in the profile and a clearly detected population of Sculptor stars following a {$\Sigma$}{\textasciitilde}r-2 decline to more than 2rlim. This break population must signify either the presence of an extremely broad distribution of bound ``halo stars'' around the Sculptor dSph or the presence of unbound tidal debris. If the latter is true, we determine a fractional mass-loss rate of approximately 0.042 Gyr-1 for the Sculptor dSph. Additional support for the notion that there is tidal disruption comes from the two-dimensional distribution of our Sculptor candidate stars; both the RGB and BHB samples show increasingly elongated isodensity contours with radius that point to an apparent stretching reminiscent of what is seen in models of disrupting satellite galaxies. Finally, we find that RGB stars that are more likely to be metal-poor (based on their color and magnitude) are significantly less centrally concentrated and therefore constitute the primary contributing stellar population to the likely tidally stripped parts of the dSph.},

Using the 305-m Arecibo radiotelescope to make precise timing measurements of pulses from the recently discovered 6.2-ms pulsar PSR1257 +12 (ref. 2), we demonstrate that, rather than being associated with a stellar object, the pulsar is orbited by two or more planet-sized bodies. The planets detected so far have masses of at least 2.8 M{$\oplus$} and 3.4 M{$\oplus$} where M{$\oplus$} is the mass of the Earth. Their respective distances from the pulsar are 0.47 AU and 0.36 AU, and they move in almost circular orbits with periods of 98.2 and 66.6 days. Observations indicate that at least one more planet may be present in this system. The detection of a planetary system around a nearby ({\textasciitilde}500 pc), old neutron star, together with the recent report on a planetary companion to the pulsar PSR1829-10 (ref. 3) raises the tantalizing possibility that a non-negligible fraction of neutron stars observable as radio pulsars may be orbited by planet-like bodies.},

Our ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs; \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}{\textbackslash}lt 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) have their star formation (SF) truncated early (z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2), likely by reionization, while classical dwarfs (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}{\textbackslash}gt 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) continue forming stars to z \&lt; 0.5.

The lowest mass UFDs are below surface brightness limits of current surveys but are potentially visible in next-generation surveys (e.g. LSST). The stellar metallicities are lower than in LG dwarfs; this may reflect pre-enrichment of the LG by the massive hosts or Pop-III stars. Consistency with lower resolution studies implies that our simulations are numerically robust (for a given physical model).},

  abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at \$z=2.53\$. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to \${\textbackslash}sim2\$ Gyr, suggesting a rich formation history starting at \$z{\textbackslash}sim10\$. While the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative \${\textbackslash}sim2-3{\textbackslash}times\$ higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}6-10{\textasciicircum}7{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.},

  abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new two-parameter family of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy models. The mass distribution has a Plummer profile and falls like R-4 in projection, in agreement with the star-count data. The first free parameter controls the velocity anisotropy and the second controls the dark matter content. The dark matter distribution can be varied from one extreme of mass-follows-light through a near-isothermal halo with flat rotation curve to the other extreme of an extended dark halo with harmonic core. This family of models is explored analytically in some detail - the distribution functions, the intrinsic moments and the projected moments are all calculated. For the nearby Galactic dSphs, samples of hundreds of discrete radial velocities are becoming available. A technique is developed to extract the anisotropy and dark matter content from such data sets by maximizing the likelihood function of the sample of radial velocities. This is constructed from the distribution function and corrected for observational errors and the effects of binaries. Tests on simulated data sets show that samples of {\textasciitilde}1000 discrete radial velocities are ample to break the degeneracy between mass and anisotropy in the nearby dSphs. Interesting constraints can already be placed on the distribution of the dark matter with samples of {\textasciitilde}160 radial velocities (the size of the present-day data set for Draco). The Space Interferometry Mission or SIM allows very accurate differential astrometry at faint magnitudes. This can be used to measure the internal proper motions of stars in the nearby Galactic dSphs. Our simulations show that {\textasciitilde}100 proper motions are sufficient to demolish the mass-anisotropy degeneracy completely. The target stars in Draco are at magnitudes of V{\textasciitilde}19-20 and the required proper motion accuracy is 3-6{$\mu$}asyr-1. The measurement of the proper motions of a sample of {\textasciitilde}100 stars uncontaminated with binaries will take about 400h of SIM time, or under 2 per cent of the mission lifetime.},

  abstract = {We use the rapid binary population synthesis code COMPAS to investigate commonly used prescriptions for the determination of mass transfer stability in close binaries and the orbital separations after stable mass transfer. The degree of orbital tightening during non-conservative mass transfer episodes is governed by the poorly-constrained angular momentum carried away by the ejected material. Increased orbital tightening drives systems towards unstable mass transfer leading to a common envelope. We find that the fraction of interacting binaries that will undergo only stable mass transfer throughout their lives fluctuates between a few and \${\textbackslash}sim 20{\textbackslash}\%\$ due to uncertainty in the angular momentum loss alone. If mass transfer is significantly non-conservative, stability prescriptions that rely on the assumption of conservative mass transfer under-predict the number of systems which experience unstable mass transfer and stellar mergers. This may substantially impact predictions about the rates of various transients, including luminous red novae, stripped-envelope supernovae, X-ray binaries, and the progenitors of coalescing compact binaries.},

To further understand this connection, we make the first ever measurement of the correlation between planet occurrence and chemical abundances for ten different elements (C, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, and Ni). Leveraging data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and Gaia to derive precise stellar parameters ( \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma \}\_\{\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\}{\textbackslash}approx 2.3 {\textbackslash}\% \$ , \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma \}\_\{\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\}{\textbackslash}approx 4.5 {\textbackslash}\% \$ ) for a sample of 1018 Kepler Objects of Interest, we construct a sample of well-vetted Kepler planets with precisely measured radii ( \$\{{\textbackslash}sigma \}\_\{\{R\}\_\{p\}\}{\textbackslash}approx 3.4 {\textbackslash}\% \$ ). After controlling for biases in the Kepler detection pipeline and the selection function of the APOGEE survey, we characterize the relationship between planet occurrence and chemical abundance as the number density of nuclei of each element in a star's photosphere raised to a power, {$\beta$}. varies by planet type, but is consistent within our uncertainties across all ten elements. For hot planets (P = 1-10 days), an enhancement in any element of 0.1 dex corresponds to an increased occurrence of {$\approx$}20\% for super-Earths (R p = 1-1.9 R {$\oplus$}) and {$\approx$}60\% for sub-Neptunes (R p = 1.9-4 R {$\oplus$}). Trends are weaker for warm (P = 10-100 days) planets of all sizes and for all elements, with the potential exception of sub-Saturns (R p = 4-8 R {$\oplus$}). Finally, we conclude this work with a caution to interpreting trends between planet occurrence and stellar age due to degeneracies caused by Galactic chemical evolution and make predictions for planet occurrence rates in nearby open clusters to facilitate demographics studies of young planetary systems.},

To investigate how the formation and evolution of galaxies take place in Milgromian gravity (MOND), we present full hydrodynamical simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code. These are the first-ever galaxy formation simulations done in MOND with detailed hydrodynamics, including star formation, stellar feedback, radiative transfer, and supernovae. These models start from simplified initial conditions, in the form of isolated, rotating gas spheres in the early universe. These collapse and form late-type galaxies obeying several scaling relations, which was not a priori expected. The formed galaxies have a compact bulge and a disk with exponentially decreasing surface mass density profiles and scale lengths consistent with observed galaxies, as well as vertical stellar mass distributions with distinct exponential profiles (thin and thick disk). This work thus shows for the first time that disk galaxies with exponential profiles in both gas and stars are a generic outcome of collapsing gas clouds in MOND. These models have a slight lack of stellar angular momentum because of their somewhat compact stellar bulge, which is connected to the simple initial conditions and the negligible later gas accretion. We also analyze how the addition of more complex baryonic physics changes the resulting main properties of the models and find this to be negligibly so in the Milgromian framework.},

Using MMFS at the Magellan/Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, we have acquired 8855 spectra from 7103 red-giant candidates in these Galactic satellites. We list measurements of each star's line-of-sight velocity (median error {\textpm}2.1 km s-1) and spectral line indices for iron and magnesium absorption features. We use globular cluster spectra to calibrate the indices onto standard [Fe/H] metallicity scales, but comparison of the resulting metallicities with published values suggests that the MMFS indices are best used as indicators of relative, not absolute, metallicity. The empirical distributions of velocity and spectral indices also allow us to quantify the amount of contamination by foreground stars. In a companion paper, we develop an algorithm that evaluates the membership probability for each star, showing that the present MMFS sample contains more than 5000 dSph members, including 774 Carina members, 2483 Fornax members, 1365 Sculptor members, and 441 Sextans members. This paper presents data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of PC projections, PLS regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be ``polished'' or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.},

In addition to quantifying the correlations between pairs of variables, we explore the `shape' of the distribution of galaxies in log parameter space using standardized principal component analysis, the analysis is performed first in the 3D structural parameter space of stellar mass M*, internal velocity V and characteristic radius R* (or surface brightness {$\mu$}*). It is then extended to a 4D space that includes a stellar population parameter such as metallicity Z or star formation rate . We find that the local group dwarfs basically define a one-parameter `fundamental line' (FL), primarily driven by stellar mass, M*. A more detailed inspection reveals differences between the star formation properties of dwarf irregulars (dI's) and dwarf ellipticals (dE's), beyond the tendency of the latter to be more massive. In particular, the metallicities of dI's are typically lower by a factor of 3 at a given M* and they grow faster with increasing M*, showing a tighter FL in the 4D space for the dE's. The structural scaling relations of dI's resemble those of the more massive spirals, but the dI's have lower star formation rates for a given M* which also grow faster with increasing M*. On the other hand, the FL of the dE's departs from the fundamental plane of bigger ellipticals. While the one-parameter nature of the FL and the associated slopes of the scaling relations are consistent with the general predictions of supernova feedback from Dekel \& Woo, the differences between the FL's of the dE's and the dI's remain a challenge and should serve as a guide for the secondary physical processes responsible for these two types.},

  abstract = {Stellar streams are particularly sensitive probes of the mass distribution of galaxies. In this work, we focus on the Helmi Streams, the remnants of an accreted dwarf galaxy orbiting the inner Milky Way. We examine in depth their peculiar dynamical properties, and use these to provide tight constraints on the Galactic potential, and specifically on its dark matter halo in the inner 20 kpc. We extract 6D phase-space information for the Helmi Streams from Gaia DR3, and confirm that the Streams split up into two clumps in angular momentum space, and that these depict different degrees of phase-mixing. To explain these characteristics we explore a range of Galactic potential models with a triaxial NFW halo, further constrained by rotation curve data. We find that a Galactic potential with a mildly triaxial dark matter halo, having \$p=1.013{\textasciicircum}\{+0.006\}\_\{-0.006\}\$, \$q=1.204{\textasciicircum}\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.036\}\$, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{discs\}\}=4.65{\textasciicircum}\{+0.47\}\_\{-0.57\}{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{DM\}\}({$<$} 15 {\textbackslash}text\{kpc\})=1.14{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.10\}{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, is required to form two clumps in angular momentum space over time. Their formation is driven by the fact that the clumps are on different orbital families and close to an orbital resonance. This resonance also explains the different degrees of mixing observed, as well as the presence of a dynamically cold subclump (also known as S2). This first and very precise measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Galaxy uniquely reveals the high sensitivity of phase-mixed streams to the exact form of the gravitational potential.},

  abstract = {The Local Group hosts a number of dwarf galaxies that show evidence of periods of little to no star formation. We use a suite of cosmological simulations to study how star formation is reignited in such galaxies. We focus on isolated galaxies at z = 0 with halo masses between 9.2 {\texttimes} 108 and 8.4 {\texttimes} 109 M{$\odot$}, where star formation is typically shut off by reionization or by supernova feedback. Nearly 20 per cent of these simulated galaxies later restart star formation due to interactions with streams of gas in the intergalactic medium, indicating that this mechanism is relatively common in this mass range and that many isolated dwarfs at z = 0 may not have been isolated throughout their histories. While high ram pressure interactions lead to stripping, the encounters that reignite star formation are low density and/or low velocity and thus low ram pressure, resulting in compression of the hot gas in the haloes of our dwarfs. The gas mass bound up in hot haloes can be substantial - at least an order of magnitude greater than the mass contained in H I. Consequently, we find that dwarfs that have experienced reignition tend to be more H I-rich and have a higher M\_\{H I\}/M\_\{*\} ratio at z = 0 than galaxies with continuous star formation. Using this fact, we identify galaxies in the Local Volume that might have `gappy' star formation histories, and can be studied by the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {Previous studies found that stellar scattering by massive clumps can lead to the formation of exponential profiles in galaxy discs, but details on how a star is moved around have not been fully explained. We use a GADGET-2 simulation where an exponential profile forms from an initially Gaussian disc in about 4 Gyr for a low-mass galaxy like a dwarf irregular. We find that nearly all large angular momentum changes of stars are caused by star-clump encounters with the closest approach less than 0.5 kpc. During star-clump encounters, stars may increase their random motions, resulting in an increase in the average radial and vertical actions of the whole stellar population. The angular momentum change and the radial action change of an individual star are influenced by the direction from which the star approaches a clump. A star initially at a higher galactic radius relative to the scattering clump usually gets pulled inwards and loses its angular momentum during the encounter, and one at a lower radius tends to shift outwards and gains angular momentum. The increase in the radial action is the largest if a star encounters a clump from the azimuthal direction, and is the smallest from a radial approach. The angular momentum change due to encounters has an inward bias when the clump profile has a steep radial decline, and a shallow decline can make the bias outwards. The stellar profile evolution towards an exponential seems to occur regardless of the direction of the bias.},

  abstract = {We examine the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of \${\textasciicircum}4\$He in one-zone and multi-zone models, with particular attention to theoretical predictions and empirical constraints on IMF-averaged yields. Published models of massive star winds and core collapse supernovae span a factor of 2 -- 3 in the IMF-averaged \${\textasciicircum}4\$He yield, \$y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{He\}{\textasciicircum}\{CC\}\}\$. Published models of intermediate mass, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars show better agreement on the IMF-averaged yield, \$y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{He\}{\textasciicircum}\{AGB\}\}\$, and they predict that more than half of this yield comes from stars with \$M=4-8 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, making AGB \${\textasciicircum}4\$He enrichment rapid compared to Fe enrichment from Type Ia supernovae. Although our GCE models include many potentially complicating effects, the short enrichment time delay and mild metallicity dependence of the predicted yields makes the results quite simple: across a wide range of metallicity and age, the non-primordial \${\textasciicircum}4\$He mass fraction \${\textbackslash}Delta Y = Y-Y\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{P\}\}\$ is proportional to the abundance of promptly produced \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-elements, like oxygen, with \${\textbackslash}Delta Y/Z\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\} {\textbackslash}approx (y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{He\}{\textasciicircum}\{CC\}\}+y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{He\}{\textasciicircum}\{AGB\}\})/y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{O\}{\textasciicircum}\{CC\}\}\$. Reproducing solar abundances with our fiducial choice of the oxygen yield \$y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{O\}{\textasciicircum}\{CC\}\}=0.0071\$ implies \$y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{He\}{\textasciicircum}\{CC\}\}+y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{He\}{\textasciicircum}\{AGB\}\} {\textbackslash}approx 0.022\$, i.e., \$0.022M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ of net \${\textasciicircum}4\$He production per solar mass of star formation. Our GCE models with this yield normalization are consistent with most available observations, though the implied \$y{\textbackslash}mathrm\{\_\{He\}{\textasciicircum}\{CC\}\}\$ is low compared to most of the published massive star models. More precise measurements of \${\textbackslash}Delta Y\$ in stars and gas across a wide range of metallicity and [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] ratio could test our models more stringently, either confirming the simple picture suggested by our calculations or revealing surprises in the evolution of the second most abundant element.},

  abstract = {Low-mass stars, those with main-sequence lifetimes that are of order the age of the Universe, provide unique constraints on the Initial Mass Function (IMF) when they formed. Star counts in systems with simple star-formation histories are particularly straightforward to interpret, and those in old systems allow one to determine the low-mass stellar IMF at large look-back times and thus at high redshift. We present the faint stellar luminosity function (based on optical HST data) in an external galaxy, the Ursa Minor dwarf Spheroidal (dSph). This relatively-nearby (distance 70kpc) companion galaxy to the Milky Way has a stellar population with narrow distributions of age and of metallicity, remarkably similar to that of a classical halo globular cluster such as M92 or M15, i.e. old and metal-poor. Contrasting with globular clusters, the internal velocity dispersion of the Ursa Minor dSph indicates the presence of significant amounts of dark matter. We find that the main sequence stellar luminosity function of the Ursa Minor dSph, and implied IMF, down to 0.4 of a solar mass is indistinguishable from that of the halo globular clusters M92 and M15. Thus the low mass stellar IMF for stars that formed at high redshift is invariant in going from a low-surface-brightness, dark-matter-dominated external galaxy, to a globular cluster within the Milky Way.},

The constancy of the ratio of nitrogen to sulfur for low-luminosity disk galaxies and the rise with luminosity for more luminous galaxies may be interpreted as a consequence of supernova-driven winds efficiently removing stellar ejecta from galaxies with binding energy per unit mass below a critical value, shown here to be around 100 km/s, while more massive galaxies can enrich their gas through successive generations of stars. The effect of large gas loss from shallow potential wells is also manifest in the relation between mean gas metallicity, measured by the mean oxygen abundance in H II regions, and absolute magnitude of the parent galaxy.},

To reject contaminators, a variety of cuts are applied in sky position, colour-magnitude diagram, metallicity, proper motion, and radial velocity. We compare our data to a mock stream generated by modelling the cluster's disruption under a smooth Galactic potential plus the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The concordant trends in phase space between the model and observations imply that the stream might have been perturbed by the LMC. The two most distant stars among the 11 detected members trace the stream's length to 60{$^\circ$} of sky, supporting and extending the previous length of 45{$^\circ$}. Given that NGC 5466 is so distant and potentially has a longer tail than previously thought, we expect that the NGC 5466 tidal stream could be a useful tool in constraining the Milky Way gravitational field.},

Our pre-selection of stars belonging to Fornax is based on their proper motions, parallaxes, and colour-magnitude diagram. The latter criteria provide a Fornax star sample, which we further restrict by colour and magnitude to eliminate contaminations due to either Milky Way stars or QSOs. The precision of the data has been sufficient to reach extremely small contaminations (0.02-0.3 per cent), allowing us to reach to a background level 12 magnitudes deeper than the central surface brightness of Fornax. We discover a break in the density profile, which reveals the presence of an additional component that extents 2.1 degree in radius, i.e. 5.4 kpc, and almost seven times the half-light radius of Fornax. The extended new component represents 10 per cent of the stellar mass of Fornax, and behaves like an extended halo. The absence of tidally elongated features at such an unprecedented depth (equivalent to 37.94 {\textpm} 0.16 mag arcsec-2 in V-band) rules out a possible role of tidal stripping. We instead suggest that Fornax is likely at first infall, and has lost its gas very recently, which consequently leads to a lack of gravity implying that residual stars have spherically expanded to form the newly discovered stellar halo of Fornax.},

  abstract = {In this work, we employ a multicomponent decomposition model to study the Sextans and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which have distinct evolutionary histories. Sextans exhibits massive stars dominating in the early stages of its evolution and a lower contribution from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). With increasing metallicity, the evolution of massive stars in Sextans shows two turning points, at [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2.8 and [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2.0, indicating episodes of accretion events and galactic winds during its evolution. In the late stages, influenced by galactic winds, the contribution from massive stars ceases, and SNe Ia become the dominant evolutionary process. Sculptor exhibits contributions from the main r-process, early very massive stars, massive stars, SNe Ia, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In its early stages, the contributions from early very massive stars and massive stars are dominant, while the contribution from SNe Ia is low. Around [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2, the contribution from early very massive stars starts to decline, while the contributions from SNe Ia and massive stars continue to increase. At [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -1.7, the contribution from massive stars gradually decreases and approaches the level of the solar neighborhood, while the contribution from AGB stars continues to rise with increasing metallicity. Both dwarf galaxies exhibit characteristic features of similar initial mass functions, but the Sextans dwarf galaxy exhibits a high-mass cutoff, while the Sculptor dwarf galaxy does not. Additionally, through decomposition, we can analyze the contributions of different astrophysical processes to [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H], [iron-group/Fe] versus [Fe/H], and [neutron-capture/Fe] versus [Fe/H].},

The location of the stream approaches the Galactic center, implying a possible connection between its orbit and its unusual morphology. Here we demonstrate that the morphology of Ophiuchus can be attributed to its interaction with the decelerating Galactic bar, which leads to the flipping or transposition of its tidal tails. The short length of the stream is the result of stars stripped in the ancient past still remaining concentrated, and the spur, as well as the fanning, are composed of either leading or trailing tails built up of stars released at different time intervals. Our new spectroscopic data, obtained as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey, and modeling of Ophiuchus indicate that, in the presence of the bar, an initial leading tail can be redistributed to the trailing side and vice versa, and the morphology of a stream can be reshaped. This result confirms that the Galactic bar plays a vital role in reconstructing the orbital behavior of streams passing close to the central region of the Milky Way.},

The sample includes 147 CEMP-s (and CEMP-r/s) stars, 127 CEMP-no stars, and 31 CEMP stars that are unclassified, based on the currently employed [Ba/Fe] criterion. We confirm previous claims that the distribution of A(C) for CEMP stars is (at least) bimodal, with newly determined peaks centered on A(C) = 7.96 (the high-C region) and A(C) = 6.28 (the low-C region). A very high fraction of CEMP-s (and CEMP-r/s) stars belongs to the high-C region, while the great majority of CEMP-no stars resides in the low-C region. However, there exists complexity in the morphology of the A(C)-[Fe/H] space for the CEMP-no stars, a first indication that more than one class of first-generation stellar progenitors may be required to account for their observed abundances. The two groups of CEMP-no stars we identify exhibit clearly different locations in the A(Na)-A(C) and A(Mg)-A(C) spaces, also suggesting multiple progenitors. The clear distinction in A(C) between the CEMP-s (and CEMP-r/s) stars and the CEMP-no stars appears to be as successful, and likely more astrophysically fundamental, for the separation of these sub-classes as the previously recommended criterion based on [Ba/Fe] (and [Ba/Eu]) abundance ratios. This result opens the window for its application to present and future large-scale low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic surveys.},

  abstract = {Radial migration is an important dynamical effect that has reshaped the Galactic disk, but its origin has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we present evidence that resonant dragging by the corotation of a decelerating bar could be the main driver of radial migration in the Milky Way disk. Using a test particle simulation, we demonstrate this scenario explains the two distinct age--metallicity sequences observed in the solar vicinity: the plateauing upper sequence is interpreted as stars dragged outward by the expanding corotation of the decelerating bar and the steeper lower sequence as stars formed locally around the solar circle. The upper migrated sequence dominates at guiding radii around the current corotation radius of the bar, R {$\sim$} 7 kpc, but rapidly dies away beyond this where the mechanism cannot operate. This behavior naturally explains the radial dependence of the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-bimodality, in particular the truncation of the high-[{$\alpha$}/Fe] disk beyond the solar circle. Under our proposed radial migration scenario, we constrain the Milky Way bar's pattern speed evolution using the age--metallicity distribution of stars currently trapped at corotation. We find the bar likely formed with an initial pattern speed of 60-100 km s-1 kpc-1 and began decelerating 6-8 Gyr ago at a rate of (where the quoted ranges include systematic uncertainties).},

  abstract = {For the first time, we present an extensive study of stars with individual non-LTE (NLTE) abundances for 17 chemical elements from Li to Eu in a sample of stars uniformly distributed over the -2.62 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} +0.24 metallicity range that is suitable for the Galactic chemical evolution research. The star sample has been kinematically selected to trace the Galactic thin and thick disks and halo. We find new results and improve earlier ones as follows: (I) the element-to-iron ratios for Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti form a metal-poor (MP) plateau at a similar height of 0.3 dex, and the knee occurs at common [Fe/H] {$\simeq$} -0.8. The knee at the same metallicity is observed for [O/Fe], and the MP plateau is formed at [O/Fe] = 0.61. (II) The upward trend of [C/O] with decreasing metallicity exists at [Fe/H] {$<$} -1.2, supporting the earlier finding of Akerman et al. (III) An underabundance of Na relative to Mg in the [Fe/H] {$<$} -1 stars is nearly constant, with the mean [Na/ Mg] {$\simeq$} -0.5. (IV) The K/Sc, Ca/Sc, and Ti/Sc ratios form well-defined trends, suggesting a common site of the K-Ti production. (v) Sr follows the Fe abundance down to [Fe/H] {$\simeq$} -2.5, while Zr is enhanced in MP stars. (VI) The comparisons of our results with some widely used Galactic evolution models are given. The use of the NLTE element abundances gives increased credit to the interpretation of the data in the context of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. Based on observations collected at the UCO/Lick Observatory, USA, and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.},

  abstract = {We present a new discrete chemo-dynamical axisymmetric modelling technique, which we apply to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. The major improvement over previous Jeans models is that realistic chemical distributions are included directly in the dynamical modelling of the discrete data. This avoids loss of information due to spatial binning and eliminates the need for hard cuts to remove contaminants and to separate stars based on their chemical properties. Using a combined likelihood in position, metallicity and kinematics, we find that our models naturally separate Sculptor stars into a metal-rich and a metal-poor population. Allowing for non-spherical symmetry, our approach provides a central slope of the dark matter density of {$\gamma$} = 0.5 {\textpm} 0.3. The metal-rich population is nearly isotropic (with {$\beta$} \_r{\textasciicircum}\{red\} = 0.0{\textpm} 0.1), while the metal-poor population is tangentially anisotropic (with {$\beta$} \_r{\textasciicircum}\{blue\} = -0.2{\textpm} 0.1) around the half-light radius of 0.26 kpc. A weak internal rotation of the metal-rich population is revealed with vmax/{$\sigma$}0 = 0.15 {\textpm} 0.15. We run tests using mock data to show that a discrete data set with {$\sim$}6000 stars is required to distinguish between a core ({$\gamma$} = 0) and cusp ({$\gamma$} = 1), and to constrain the possible internal rotation to better than 1{$\sigma$} confidence with our model. We conclude that our discrete chemo-dynamical modelling technique provides a flexible and powerful tool to robustly constrain the internal dynamics of multiple populations, and the total mass distribution in a stellar system.},

  abstract = {We study the impact of baryons on the distribution of dark matter in a Milky Way-sized halo by comparing a high-resolution, moving mesh cosmological simulation with its dark matter-only counterpart. We identify three main processes related to baryons - adiabatic contraction, tidal disruption, and reionization - which jointly shape the dark matter distribution in both the main halo and its subhaloes. The relative effect of each baryonic process depends strongly on the subhalo mass. For massive subhaloes with maximum circular velocity vmax {$>$} 35 km s-1, adiabatic contraction increases the dark matter concentration, making these haloes less susceptible to tidal disruption. For low-mass subhaloes with vmax {$<$} 20 km s-1, reionization effectively reduces their mass on average by {$\approx$}30 per cent and vmax by {$\approx$}20 per cent. For intermediate subhaloes with 20 km s-1 {$<$} vmax {$<$} 35 km s-1, which share a similar mass range as the classical dwarf spheroidals, strong tidal truncation induced by the main galaxy reduces their vmax. As a combined result of reionization and increased tidal disruption, the total number of low-mass subhaloes in the hydrodynamic simulation is nearly halved compared to that of the N-body simulation. We do not find dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies, unlike previous studies that employed bursty feedback-driven outflows. The substantial impact of baryons on the abundance and internal structure of subhaloes suggests that galaxy formation and evolution models based on N-body simulations should include these physical processes as major components.},

  abstract = {Kernel density estimation for multivariate data is an important technique that has a wide range of applications. However, it has received significantly less attention than its univariate counterpart. The lower level of interest in multivariate kernel density estimation is mainly due to the increased difficulty in deriving an optimal data-driven bandwidth as the dimension of the data increases. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for estimating optimal bandwidth matrices for multivariate kernel density estimation. Our approach is based on treating the elements of the bandwidth matrix as parameters whose posterior density can be obtained through the likelihood crossvalidation criterion. Numerical studies for bivariate data show that the MCMC algorithm generally performs better than the plug-in algorithm under the Kullback--Leibler information criterion, and is as good as the plug-in algorithm under the mean integrated squared error (MISE) criterion. Numerical studies for five-dimensional data show that our algorithm is superior to the normal reference rule. Our MCMC algorithm is the first data-driven bandwidth selector for multivariate kernel density estimation that is applicable to data of any dimension.},
