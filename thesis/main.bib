  abstract = {The discovery of carbon stars in the Leo I, Leo II, and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies is reported. The C2 and CN band strengths are found to be well correlated with each other, although there is a wide range in band strength at fixed color. The number of carbon stars is shown not to be a simple function of parent galaxy luminosity nor of metallicity. Only one carbon star is detected in Leo I. The newly discovered Ursa Minor C star lies well below the giant branch tip in the color-magnitude diagram, and it is suggested that the location of this star may support the argument that more than one process is required to make dwarf spheroidal carbon stars. It is concluded that mechanisms for producing carbon stars are favored in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, as opposed to globular clusters in our Galaxy, although the nature and number of the physical mechanisms required to account for the large range observed in C star luminosity and spectral appearance are still unresolved.},

  abstract = {Velocities accurate to about 1 km/s have been obtained with the Multiple Mirror Telescope and echelle spectrograph for three carbon stars in the Draco dwarf galaxy and one carbon star in the Ursa Minor dwarf. These observations demonstrate that measurement of radial velocities having such high precision is quite feasible for stars as faint as V = 18 mag. The data presented here are of importance for understanding the dynamical history of the dwarf systems. In addition, they provide a first and tantalizing hint of the velocity dispersion in a dwarf spheroidal and suggest that Draco may have a mass-to-light ratio an order of magnitude greater than that found for galactic globulars. If confirmed, this result would support the existence of a massive halo about the Galaxy. It would furthermore rule out the possibility that neutrinos could provide a solution to the missing mass problem, if the dark matter on small and large scales is similar.},

  abstract = {With the increasing number of large stellar survey projects, the quality and quantity of excellent tracers for studying the Milky Way are rapidly growing, one of which is the classical Cepheids. Classical Cepheids are high-precision standard candles with very low typical uncertainties ({$<$}3\%) available via the mid-infrared period-luminosity relation. About 3500 classical Cepheids identified from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova, Gaia, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Zwicky Transient Facility survey data have been analyzed in this work, and their spatial distributions show a clear signature of Galactic warp. Two kinematical methods are adopted to measure the Galactic rotation curve (RC) in the Galactocentric distance range of \$4{\textbackslash}lesssim \{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GC\}\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 19{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ . Gently declining RCs are derived by both the proper motion (PM) method and three-dimensional velocity vector (3DV) method. The largest sample of classical Cepheids with the most accurate 6D phase-space coordinates available to date are modeled in the 3DV method, and the resulting RC is found to decline at the relatively smaller gradient of (-1.33 {\textpm} 0.1) \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ . Comparing to results from the PM method, a higher rotation velocity ((232.5 {\textpm} 0.83) \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{s\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ ) is derived at the position of the Sun in the 3DV method. The virial mass and local dark matter density are estimated from the 3DV method, which is the more reliable method, \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}=(0.822{\textbackslash}pm 0.052){\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}rho \}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{DM\},{\textbackslash}odot \}=0.33{\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$ GeV, respectively.},

The new potential is completely analytical; the density can be obtained from it in closed form and it is positive everywhere. Extreme mathematical simplicity is retained, as well as a good representation of the observed values of both the rotation curve and the perpendicular force. The new model consists of a spherical central bulge and a disk, both of the Miyamoto-Nagai (1975) form, plus a massive, spherical, halo. The total mass of the model is 9.00x1011 solar masses. The model escape velocity for objects in the solar vicinity is 535.7 km s-1. The values obtained for the galactic rotation constants are A = 12.95 km s-1kpc-1 and B = -12.93 km s-1kpc-1; they are in good agreement with recent observational data. In contrast to other models for our galaxy, the proposed potential function is extremely simple, fully analytical, continuous, and with continuous derivatives everywhere. The suitability of this potential for efficient and accurate numerical orbit computations is demonstrated by recalculating the orbits of several nearby, high velocity stars.},

Mergers of lower-mass galaxies are expected within the hierarchical process of galaxy formation, but have hitherto not been seen for galaxies with less than about 109 solar masses in stars. Here we report the kinematic detection of a stellar stream in one of the satellite galaxies of Andromeda, the dwarf spheroidal Andromeda II, which has a mass of only 107 solar masses in stars. The properties of the stream show that we are observing the remnant of a merger between two dwarf galaxies. This had a drastic influence on the dynamics of the remnant, which is now rotating around its projected major axis. The stellar stream in Andromeda II illustrates the scale-free character of the formation of galaxies, down to the lowest galactic mass scales.},

Assuming the efficiency of energy injection of the SNe II into DM particles is epsilongc = 0.05, we find that a single early episode, z {$>$}{\textasciitilde} z infall, that combines the energy of all SNe II due to explode over 0.5 Gyr is sufficient to create a core of several hundred parsecs in both Sculptor and Fornax. Therefore, our results suggest that it is energetically plausible to form cores in cold dark matter (CDM) halos via early episodic gas outflows triggered by SNe II. Furthermore, based on CDM merger rates and phase-space density considerations, we argue that the probability of a subsequent complete regeneration of the cusp is small for a substantial fraction of dwarf-size halos.},

We detect a statistically significant non-zero gradient only in Sextans and Sculptor. Through modelling of the gradient and 2D density of the systems by triaxial Plummer models, we find that the distance gradients in both dwarf galaxies are inconsistent with prolate shape, but compatible with oblate or triaxial shapes. In order to explain the observed gradients, oblate models of Sextans and Sculptor need to have a significant intrinsic ellipticity larger than 0.47 for Sextans and 0.46 for Sculptor. The flattened oblate shape may imply a significant anisotropy in velocity distribution in order to be consistent with the lack of significant velocity gradients in these systems.},

These velocities were obtained using the KPNO 4 m telescope with the Hydra multifiber positioner and bench spectrograph in 1992,1993, and 1994. Both simulations and repeated measurements show that the median uncertainty in these velocities is 4.0 km/s. Our velocities are compared with the other major datasets for Draco and Ursa Minor. Aside from a small zero-point difference, there is excellent agreement between the Hydra velocities and the Olszewski et al. MMT echelle velocities. Comparison with the Hargreaves et al. Ursa Minor velocities reveals inconsistencies which we ascribe to underestimated errors in the Hargreaves et al. data, After correcting for zero-point differences, we combine the three major sets of velocities. Our spectra recovered all of the known Carbon (C) stars in Draco and Ursa Minor and revealed one new C star in Draco and two in Ursa Minor. In addition, one star whose velocity is consistent with membership in Ursa Minor has a deep and wide H{$\beta$} absorption line in its spectrum. An initial discussion of the kinematics of the two galaxies is presented. The systemic velocities of Draco and Ursa Minor are -293.3 +/- 1.0 and -247.4 +/- 1.0 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, respectively. Ursa Minor shows apparent rotation about a position angle of 75{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} with an amplitude of about 3 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}; the morphological major axis is 53{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} +/-5{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum}. No such rotation is found in Draco. We find a velocity dispersion of 10.4 +/- 0.9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Ursa Minor including all stars and 8.8 +/- 0.8 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} excluding the star with the most extreme velocity. In Draco we find 10.7 +/- 0.9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} including all stars and 8.5 +/- 0.7 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} excluding the three stars with the most extreme velocities. These dispersions are consistent with the dispersions measured in the other two studies and confirm that Draco and Ursa Minor have the largest mass-to-light ratios of any of the dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {Aims: We aim to compute the binary fraction of "classical" dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) that are satellites of the Milky Way (MW). This value can offer insights into the binary fraction in environments that are less dense and more metal-poor than our own galaxy. Additionally, knowledge of the binary fraction in dwarf galaxies is important with respect to avoiding overestimations of their dark matter content, inferred from stellar kinematics. Methods: We refined an existing method from the literature, placing an emphasis on providing robust uncertainties on the value of the binary fraction. We applied this modified method to a VLT/FLAMES dataset for Sculptor, specifically acquired for the purpose of velocity monitoring of individual stars, as well as to literature datasets for other six MW "classical" dSphs. In all cases, the targeted stars were mainly red giant branch stars, with expected masses of around 0.8 M{$\odot$}. The VLT/FLAMES dataset offers the most precise binary fractions compared to literature datasets, due to its time baseline of 12 yr, along with at least nine repeated observations for each star. Results: We found that the binary fraction of Sculptor is 0.55-0.19+0.17. We find that it is important to take into account the Roche lobe overflow for constraining the period distribution of binary stars. In contrast to what has recently been proposed in the literature, our analysis indicates that there is no evidence to support varying the properties of the binary stellar population or their deviations from those established for the solar neighborhood, based on the sample of MW dSphs analyzed here.

Therefore, we re-examine the chemo-kinematic properties of this galaxy, making use of the best spectroscopic dataset available containing both the line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of individual stars. Methods. We carried out a detailed, quantitative analysis on a recent spectroscopic dataset from the literature that contains high precision velocities and metallicities for 1339 members of Sculptor. In particular, we assessed whether Sculptor is best represented by a single stellar population with a negative metallicity gradient or by the super-position of two or more components with a different mean metallicity, spatial distribution, and kinematic properties. For this analysis, we also include the incompleteness of the spectroscopic dataset. Results. We find that Sculptor is better described by a two-population model than by a single-population model with a metallicity gradient. Moreover, given the assumptions of the current modeling, we find evidence of a third population, composed of few stars, that is more extended and metal-poor than the two other populations. This very metal-poor group of stars shows a shift of {\textasciitilde}15 km s-1 in its average line-of-sight velocity (vlos) with respect to the rest of the galaxy. We discuss several possible origins for this new population, finding a minor merger as the most likely one. We also find a vlos gradient of 4.0-1.5+1.5 km s-1 deg-1 but its statistical evidence is inconclusive and, moreover, its detection is partially driven by the group of stars with off-set velocities.},

Here we study the progenitor of the recently discovered Leiptr stellar stream, which was previously suggested to be a tidally disrupted halo globular cluster. We obtain high-resolution spectra of five red giant branch stars selected from the Gaia DR2 STREAMFINDER catalog with Magellan/MIKE. One star is a clear non-member. The remaining four stars display chemical abundances consistent with those of a low-mass dwarf galaxy: they have a low mean metallicity, \${\textbackslash}langle\{{\textbackslash}rm[Fe/H]\}{\textbackslash}rangle = -2.2\$; they do not all have identical metallicities; and they display low [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] \${\textbackslash}sim 0\$ and [Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] \${\textbackslash}sim -1\$. This pattern of low \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and neutron-capture element abundances is only found in intact dwarf galaxies with stellar mass \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Although more data are needed to be certain, Leiptr's chemistry is consistent with being the lowest-mass dwarf galaxy stream without a known intact progenitor, possibly in the mass range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Leiptr thus preserves a record of one of the lowest-mass early accretion events into the Milky Way.},

In this work, we analyze photometric metallicities for 3883 stars over seven half-light radii (\${\textbackslash}rm r\_h\$) in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (Scl dSph) galaxy, using new narrow-band imaging data from the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey conducted with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the 4-m Blanco Telescope. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of MAGIC using the Scl dSph galaxy, one of the most well-studied satellites of the Milky Way. Our sample ranges from \${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}approx - 4.0\$ to \${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}approx - 0.6\$, includes six extremely metal-poor candidates (\${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] {\textbackslash}leq -3.0\$) without previous spectroscopic observations, and is almost three times larger than the largest spectroscopic metallicity dataset in the Scl dSph. Our spatially unbiased sample of metallicities provides a more accurate representation of the metallicity distribution function, revealing a more metal-rich peak than observed in the most recent spectroscopic sample. It also reveals a break in the metallicity gradient, with a strong change in the slope: from \$-3.35 {\textbackslash}pm 0.18 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} dex {\textbackslash}, deg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for stars inside \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm r\_h\$ to \$-0.56 {\textbackslash}pm 0.26 {\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash} dex {\textbackslash}, deg{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for the outer part of the Scl dSph.

We also use our kinematic data to measure the mass distribution within this system. By considering independently the kinematics of the two distinct stellar components known to be present in Scl, we are able to relieve known degeneracies and find that the observed velocity dispersion profiles are best fitted by a cored dark matter halo with core radius rc = 0.5 kpc and mass enclosed within the last measured point M({$<$}1.8 kpc) = (3.4 {\textpm} 0.7) {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$}, assuming an increasingly radially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid.

We applied some modifications, in particular to the way the colour-magnitude diagram and spectroscopic information are factored in, for example, by including stars in several evolution phases. The bulk motions were integrated in three gravitational potentials: two where the Milky Way was treated in isolation and has a mass 0.9 \& 1.6 {\texttimes} 1012 M{$\odot$}, and a time-varying potential, which includes the infall of a massive Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Results: We were able to determine bulk proper motions for 73 systems, and we consider 66 to be reliable measurements. For the first time, systemic motions are presented for galaxies out to a distance of 1.4 Mpc in the NGC 3109 association. The inclusion of the infall of a massive LMC significantly modifies the orbital trajectories of the objects, with respect to orbit integration in static Milky-Way-only potentials, and this leads to six galaxies likely being associated with the LMC, three possibly being associated with it, and one recently captured object. We discuss the results of the orbit integration in the context of the relation of the galaxies to the system of Milky Way satellites, implications for the too-big-to-fail problem, the impact on star formation histories, and tidal disruption.

The central surface density is found to be low, less than 700 stars arcmin{\textasciicircum}-2, with no sign of a pronounced cusp. The maximum of the surface density is not found at our adopted center but in a ringlike structure some 13" from it. We identify this feature with the subclustering identified by Olszewski \& Aaronson, who believed that it was off-center. The currently accepted King's structural parameters, r\_c and r\_t, of Ursa Minor are found to be unsuitable to represent the stellar surface density near the center. Our star counts are used to obtain a lower limit of the central stellar density without the use of the velocity dispersion. We find a lower limit of 1.7+/-1.1 M\_solar pc{\textasciicircum}-3 from stars that were counted. By extrapolating the mass function to lower masses, we estimate that the true density could increase be a factor of 7.},

We find that the amount of mass segregation in globular clusters is strongly correlated with their relaxation time and that all clusters with relaxation times of the order of their ages or longer have little to no mass segregation. For each cluster, the amount of mass segregation seen is fully compatible with the amount expected by dynamical evolution from initially unsegregated clusters, showing that globular clusters formed without primordial mass segregation among their low-mass stars. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxy candidates split into two groups, star clusters which follow the same trend between relaxation time and amount of mass segregation as globular clusters and dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies that are unsegregated despite having relaxation times smaller than a Hubble time. Stellar abundance and velocity dispersion data, where available, confirm our classification. After classification of the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy candidates, we find that outer halo star clusters have average densities inside their half-light radii of 0.03 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\rho$}h {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 M{$\odot$} pc-3, while dwarf galaxies have stellar densities of 0.001 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\rho$}h {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.03 M{$\odot$} pc-3. The reason for this separation in density is most likely a combination of the initial conditions by which the systems formed and the requirement to withstand external tidal forces.},

  abstract = {We present (V, I) photometry of two wide ({\textasciitilde}=25{\texttimes}25 arcmin2) fields centered on the low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxies Draco and Ursa Minor. New estimates of the distance to these galaxies are provided [(m-M)0(UMi)=19.41+/-0.12 and (m-M)0(Dra)=19.84+/-0.14], and a comparative study of their evolved stellar population is presented. We detect for the first time the red giant branch (RGB) bump in the luminosity function of UMi (VbumpRGB=19.40+/-0.06), while the feature is not detected in Draco. Photometric metallicity distributions are obtained for the two galaxies, and an accurate analysis to determine the intrinsic metallicity spread is performed by means of artificial star experiments. The adopted method is insensitive to stars more metal poor than [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}-2.5, and it rests on the assumption that the age spread in the considered populations is small (i.e., the impact of the actual age spread on the colors of the RGB stars is negligible). We find that while the average metallicity of the two galaxies is similar ({$<$}[Fe/H]{$>$}UMi=-1.8 and Dra=-1.7), the metallicity distributions are significantly different, having different peak values ([Fe/H]modUMi=-1.9 and [Fe/H]modDra=-1.6) and different maximum metallicities. We suggest that such differences may be partly responsible for the difference in horizontal-branch morphology between the two galaxies. The intrinsic metallicity 1 {$\sigma$} spread is {$\sigma$}i=0.10 in UMi and {$\sigma$}i=0.13 in Draco. We demonstrate that the inner region of UMi is significantly structured, at odds with what is expected for a system in dynamical equilibrium. In particular, we show that the main density peak of UMi is off-center with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and shows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy. Moreover, UMi stars are shown to be clustered according to two different characteristic clustering scales, as opposed to Draco, which instead has a very symmetric and smooth density profile. The possible consequences of this striking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are briefly discussed. Combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of the total luminosity of UMi, we find that the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of this galaxy may be as low as M/L{\textasciitilde}7, a factor of 5-10 lower than current estimates.

We find that a number of simulated dwarfs form `outside-in', with an old, metal-poor population that surrounds a younger, more concentrated metal-rich component, reminiscent of dwarf spheroidals like Sculptor or Sextans. We focus on a few examples where stars form in two populations distinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. The spatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; the old stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young population forms largely in situ. The older component results from a first episode of star formation that begins early but is quickly shut off by the combined effects of stellar feedback and reionization. The younger component forms when a late accretion event adds gas and reignites star formation. The effect of mergers is to disperse the old stellar population, increasing their radius and decreasing their central density relative to the young population. We argue that dwarf-dwarf mergers offer a plausible scenario for the formation of systems with multiple distinct populations and, more generally, for the origin of age and metallicity gradients in dwarf spheroidals.},

We use data on the positions and velocities of stars in the solar neighbourhood from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and large spectroscopic surveys to investigate the vertical number counts and mean velocity trend as a function of distance from the local Galactic mid-plane. We perform a detailed measurement of the wave-like north-south asymmetry in the vertical number counts, which reveals a number of deficits at heights {$\approx$}0.4, {$\approx$}0.9, and \{{$\approx$} \} 1.5 kpc, and peaks at {$\approx$}0.2, {$\approx$}0.7, and \{{$\approx$} \} 1.1 kpc. We find that the asymmetry pattern is independent of colour. The mean vertical velocity is almost constant to {$<$} 1 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} within a few 100 pc from the mid-plane and then displays a north-south symmetric dip at \{{$\approx$} \}0.5 kpc with an amplitude of \{{$\approx$} \} 2 km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} that is a plausible velocity counterpart to the main number count dip at a similar height. Thus, with Gaia DR2 we confirm at high fidelity that the local Galactic disc is undergoing a wave-like oscillation and a dynamically consistent observational picture of the perturbed local vertical structure emerges for the first time. We also present the most precise and accurate determination of the Sun's height above the local Galactic mid-plane, correcting for any asymmetry in the vertical density: z\_\{{$\odot$}\} = 20.8 {\textpm} 0.3 pc.},

  abstract = {The dark matter content of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy inferred from its kinematics is substantially lower than expected from LCDM cosmological simulations. We use N-body simulations to examine whether this may be the result of Galactic tides. We find that, despite improved proper motions from the Gaia mission, the pericentric distance of Fornax remains poorly constrained, mainly because its largest velocity component is roughly antiparallel to the solar motion. Translating Fornax's proper motion into a Galactocentric velocity is, thus, sensitively dependent on Fornax's assumed distance: the observed distance uncertainty, \${\textbackslash}pm 8{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$, implies pericentric distances that vary between rperi {\textasciitilde} 50 and {\textasciitilde}150 kpc. Our simulations show that for rperi in the lower range of that estimate, an LCDM subhalo with maximum circular velocity Vmax = 40 km s-1 (or virial mass \$M\_\{200\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, as expected from LCDM) would be tidally stripped to Vmax {\textasciitilde} 23 km s-1 over 10 Gyr. This would reduce the dark mass within the Fornax stellar half-mass radius to about half its initial value, bringing it into agreement with observations. Tidal stripping affects mainly Fornax's dark matter halo; its stellar component is affected little, losing less than \$5{\textbackslash},\{\{{\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash},cent\}\}\$ of its initial mass in the process. We also explore the effect of Galactic tides on the dynamical friction decay times of Fornax's population of globular clusters (GCs) and find little evidence for substantial changes, compared with models run in isolation. A population of GCs with initial orbital radii between 1 and 2 kpc is consistent with the present-day spatial distribution of Fornax GCs, despite assuming a cuspy halo. Neither the dark matter content nor the spatial distribution of GCs of Fornax seems inconsistent with a simple model where Fornax inhabits a tidally stripped cuspy cold dark matter halo.},

  abstract = {The unusually low velocity dispersion and large size of Crater II pose a challenge to our understanding of dwarf galaxies in the Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmogony. The low velocity dispersion suggests either a dark halo mass much lower than the minimum expected from hydrogen cooling limit arguments or one that is in the late stages of extreme tidal stripping. The tidal interpretation has been favoured in recent work and is supported by the small pericentric distances consistent with available kinematic estimates. We use N-body simulations to examine this interpretation in detail, assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for Crater II's progenitor halo. Our main finding is that, although the low velocity dispersion can indeed result from the effect of tides, the large size of Crater II is inconsistent with this hypothesis. This is because galaxies stripped to match the observed velocity dispersion are also reduced to sizes much smaller than the observed half-light radius of Crater II. Unless its size has been substantially overestimated, reconciling this system with LCDM requires that either (i) it is not bound and near equilibrium (unlikely, given its crossing time is shorter than the time elapsed since pericentre) or (ii) its progenitor halo deviates from the assumed NFW profile. The latter alternative may signal that baryons can affect the inner halo cusp even in extremely faint dwarfs or, more intriguingly, may signal effects associated with the intimate nature of the dark matter, such as finite self-interactions, or other such deviations from the canonical LCDM paradigm.},

  abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies populate the faintest end of the galaxy luminosity function and yet they apparently reside in massive dark matter halos. With mass-to-light ratios as high as M/L {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}4 , they are the key to understanding the nature of dark matter on galactic scales. Of particular interest are nearby dwarf spheroidals that appear at odds with predictions from LCDM, the standard model of cosmological structure formation. These are galaxies which exhibit unusually large sizes and low line-of-sight velocity dispersions, suggestive of surprisingly underdense dark matter halos, perhaps occurring as a result of tidal interactions with the Milky Way.     In this dissertation I present a detailed study of three carefully selected such cases: the Fornax, Crater II and Antlia II dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way. Fornax is chosen for its relatively low mass-to-light ratio, which is suggestive of a lower mass halo than indicated by abundance matching. Crater II and Antlia II, termed `feeble giants', are both chosen for their particularly low values of velocity dispersion, which are especially anomalous given their large half-light radii and low luminosities. Using N-body simulations, we investigate the evolution of these objects under the effects of Galactic tides imparted by the Milky Way potential.    Our study leads us to conclude that the low measured velocity dispersions of these dwarf galaxies are indeed consistent with a tidal interpretation in the context of predictions put forth by cosmological simulations of the Local Group and recent measurements of the galaxies' sky positions, proper motions, distances, and radial velocities. The large sizes of Crater II and Antlia II are much more difficult to reconcile in this scenario, however these are still possible to reproduce under the effect of Galactic tides, provided that initially the stellar binding energy distributions had a minimum ``cutoff''. Such a limit, which may have been imposed by baryonic effects during the formation of the galaxy, or by the presence of a constant density dark matter core, leads to transient stages with large sizes and low velocity dispersions comparable to those of Crater II and Antlia II. Detailed observations of galaxies' density profiles, corresponding logarithmic slopes, and velocity dispersion profiles may help provide insight into the likelihood of such a formation scenario for Crater II, Antlia II, and the emerging population of other feeble giant galaxies.},

  abstract = {We have developed spherically symmetric dynamical models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies using Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method. This type of modelling yields constraints both on the total mass distribution (e.g. enclosed mass and scale radius) and on the orbital structure of the system (e.g. velocity anisotropy). This method is thus less prone to biases introduced by assumptions in comparison to the more commonly used Jeans modelling, and it allows us to put reliable constraints on their dark matter content. Here we present our results for the Sculptor dSph galaxy, after testing our methods on mock data sets. We fit both the second and fourth velocity moment profiles to break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. For an Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) dark matter halo profile, we find that the mass of Sculptor within 1 kpc is M1 kpc = (1.03 {\textpm} 0.07) {\texttimes} 108 M{$\odot$}, and that its velocity anisotropy profile is tangentially biased and nearly constant for radii beyond {$\sim$}100 pc. The preferred concentration (c {$\sim$} 15) is low for its dark matter mass but consistent within the scatter found in N-body cosmological simulations. When we let the value of the central logarithmic slope {$\alpha$} vary, we find that the best-fitting model has {$\alpha$} = 0, although an NFW cusp or shallower is consistent at the 1{$\sigma$} confidence level. On the other hand, very cuspy density profiles with logarithmic central slopes {$\alpha$} {$<$} -1.5 are strongly disfavoured for Sculptor.},

  abstract = {Aims: We compare dark matter profile models of four dwarf spheroidal galaxies satellites of the Milky Way using Bayesian evidence. Methods: We use orbit based dynamical models to fit the 2nd and 4th moments of the line of sight velocity distributions of the Fornax, Sculptor, Carina and Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We compare NFW, Einasto and several cored profiles for their dark halos and present the probability distribution functions of the model parameters. Results: For each galaxy separately we compare the evidence for the various dark matter profiles, and find that it is not possible to distinguish between these specific parametric dark matter density profiles using the current data. Nonetheless, from the combined evidence, we find that is unlikely that all galaxies are embedded in the same type of cored profiles of the form {$\rho$}DM {$\propto$} 1/(1 + r2){$\beta$}/2, where {$\beta$} = 3,4. For each galaxy, we also obtain an almost model independent, and therefore accurate, constraint on the logarithmic slope of the dark matter density distribution at a radius {\textasciitilde}r-3, i.e. where the logarithmic slope of the stellar density profile is -3. Conclusions: For each galaxy, we find that all best fit models essentially have the same mass distribution over a large range in radius (from just below r-3 to the last measured data point). This remarkable finding likely implies much stronger constraints on the characteristics that subhalos extracted from cosmological simulations should have in order to host the dSph galaxies around the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {We investigate the non-adiabatic effect of time-dependent deformations in the Milky Way (MW) halo potential on stellar streams. Specifically, we consider the MW's response to the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and how this impacts our ability to recover the spherically averaged MW mass profile from observation using stream actions. Previously, action clustering methods have only been applied to static or adiabatic MW systems to constrain the properties of the host system. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions. We find that for streams with realistic observational uncertainties on shorter orbital periods and without close encounters with the LMC, e.g. GD-1, the radial action distribution is sufficiently clustered to locally recover the MW mass profile across the stream radial range within a 2 sigma confidence interval determined using a Fisher information approach. For streams with longer orbital periods and close encounters with the LMC, e.g. Orphan-Chenab (OC), the radial action distribution disperses as the MW halo has deformed non-adiabatically. Hence, for OC streams generated in potentials that include a MW halo with any deformations, action clustering methods will fail to recover the mass profile within a 2 sigma uncertainty. Finally, we investigate whether the clustering of stream energies can provide similar constraints. Surprisingly, we find for OC-like streams, the recovered spherically averaged mass profiles demonstrate less sensitivity to the time-dependent deformations in the potential.},

Sextans has a cutoff radius that is equal to the expected tidal radius, assuming a high mass-to-light ratio. This satellite very likely is dark matter-dominated. Carina, Ursa Minor, and Draco, on the other hand, cannot contain a dominating dark matter component if the observed ``extratidal'' stars are located exterior to the tidal radii of these systems. The evidence for tidal stripping in the absence of dark matter is also supported by the fact that the observed cutoff radii of all three satellites are equal to their tidal radii, assuming a low, globular cluster-like mass-to-light ratio. The large velocity dispersions of these galaxies, on the other hand, provide strong evidence for a massive dark matter component. In this case, the ``extratidal'' stars lie deeply embedded in the dark matter potential wells of the satellites. These stars then would represent a gravitationally bound, extended stellar component of unknown origin.},

  abstract = {As is usual in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, today the Local Group galaxy Ursa Minor is depleted of its gas content. How this galaxy lost its gas is still a matter of debate. To study the history of gas loss in Ursa Minor, we conducted the first three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of this object, assuming that the gas loss was driven by galactic winds powered only by type II supernovae (SNe II). The initial gas setup and supernova (SN) rates used in our simulations are mainly constrained by the inferred star formation history and the observed velocity dispersion of Ursa Minor. After 3 Gyr of evolution, we found that the gas removal efficiency is higher when the SN rate is increased, and also when the initial mean gas density is lowered. The derived mass-loss rates are systematically higher in the central regions ( 300 pc), even though such a relationship has not been strictly linear in time and in terms of the galactic radius. The filamentary structures induced by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and the concentric shells related to the acoustic waves driven by SNe can account for the inferred mass losses from the simulations. Our results suggest that SNe II are able to transfer most of the gas from the central region outward to the galactic halo. However, other physical mechanisms must be considered in order to completely remove the gas at larger radii.},

  abstract = {The Milky Way (MW) offers a uniquely detailed view of galactic structure and is often regarded as a prototypical spiral galaxy. But recent observations indicate that the MW is atypical: it has an undersized supermassive black hole at its centre; it is surrounded by a very low mass, excessively metal-poor stellar halo; and it has an unusually large nearby satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Here, we show that the LMC is on a collision course with the MW with which it will merge in 2.4{\textasciicircum}\{+1.2\}\_\{-0.8\} \{Gyr\} (68 per cent confidence level). This catastrophic and long-overdue event will restore the MW to normality. Using the EAGLE galaxy formation simulation, we show that, as a result of the merger, the central supermassive black hole will increase in mass by up to a factor of 8. The Galactic stellar halo will undergo an equally impressive transformation, becoming 5 times more massive. The additional stars will come predominantly from the disrupted LMC, but a sizeable number will be ejected on to the halo from the stellar disc. The post-merger stellar halo will have the median metallicity of the LMC, [Fe/H] = -0.5 dex, which is typical of other galaxies of similar mass to the MW. At the end of this exceptional event, the MW will become a true benchmark for spiral galaxies, at least temporarily.},

Leveraging deep Gemini/GMOS-N imaging (for four candidates) as well as follow-up DECam imaging (for two candidates), we characterize the morphologies and stellar populations of these systems. We find that these candidates all share faint absolute magnitudes (M V {$\geq$} -3.2 mag) and old, metal-poor stellar populations ({$\tau$} {$>$} 10 Gyr, [Fe/H] {$<$} -1.4 dex). Three of these systems are more extended (r 1/2 {$>$} 15 pc), while the other three are compact (r 1/2 {$<$} 10 pc). From these properties, we infer that the former three systems (Bo{\"o}tes V, Leo Minor I, and Virgo II) are consistent with ultra-faint dwarf galaxy classifications, whereas the latter three (DELVE 3, DELVE 4, and DELVE 5) are likely ultra-faint star clusters. Using data from the Gaia satellite, we confidently measure the proper motion of Bo{\"o}tes V, Leo Minor I, and DELVE 4, and tentatively detect a proper-motion signal from DELVE 3 and DELVE 5; no signal is detected for Virgo II. We use these measurements to explore possible associations between the newly discovered systems and the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, the Magellanic Clouds, and the Vast Polar Structure, finding several plausible associations. Our results offer a preview of the numerous ultra-faint stellar systems that will soon be discovered by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and highlight the challenges of classifying the faintest stellar systems.},

We extend their ideas of using the debiased estimator and further propose a bootstrap approach for constructing simultaneous confidence bands. This modified method has an advantage that we can easily choose the smoothing bandwidth from conventional bandwidth selectors and the confidence band will be asymptotically valid. We prove the validity of the bootstrap confidence band and generalize it to density level sets and inverse regression problems. Simulation studies confirm the validity of the proposed confidence bands/sets. We apply our approach to an Astronomy dataset to show its applicability.},

  abstract = {It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised \$N\$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.},

Other chemical abundances (e.g., C, iron peak) largely follow UFD trends and suggest that faint core-collapse supernovae (SNe) dominated the early evolution of Tucana II. We see a downturn in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] at [Fe/H] {$\approx$} -2.8, indicating the onset of Type Ia SN enrichment and somewhat extended chemical evolution. The most metal-rich star has strikingly low [Sc/Fe] = -1.29 {\textpm} 0.48 and [Mn/Fe] = -1.33 {\textpm} 0.33, implying significant enrichment by a sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia SN. We do not detect a radial velocity gradient in Tucana II ( \$\{\{dv\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{helio\}\}/d\{{\textbackslash}theta \}\_\{1\}=-\{2.6\}\_\{-2.9\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.0\}\$ km s-1 kpc-1), reflecting a lack of evidence for tidal disruption, and derive a dynamical mass of \$\{M\}\_\{1/2\}{\textbackslash},(\{r\}\_\{h\})=\{1.6\}\_\{-0.7\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\$ M {$\odot$}. We revisit formation scenarios of the extended component of Tucana II in light of its stellar chemical abundances. We find no evidence that Tucana II had abnormally energetic SNe, suggesting that if SNe drove in situ stellar halo formation, then other UFDs should show similar such features. Although not a unique explanation, the decline in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] is consistent with an early galactic merger triggering later star formation. Future observations may disentangle such formation channels of UFD outskirts. * This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

  abstract = {The distribution of dark matter in dwarf galaxies can have important implications on our understanding of galaxy formation as well as the particle physics properties of dark matter. However, accurately characterizing the dark matter content of dwarf galaxies is challenging due to limited data and complex dynamics that are difficult to accurately model. In this paper, we apply spherical Jeans modelling to simulated stellar kinematic data of spherical, isotropic dwarf galaxies with the goal of identifying the future observational directions that can improve the accuracy of the inferred dark matter distributions in the Milky Way dwarf galaxies. We explore how the dark matter inference is affected by the location and number of observed stars as well as the line-of-sight velocity measurement errors. We use mock observation to demonstrate the difficulty in constraining the inner core/cusp of the dark matter distribution with data sets of fewer than 10 000 stars. We also demonstrate the need for additional measurements to make robust estimates of the expected dark matter annihilation signal strength. For the purpose of deriving robust indirect detection constraints, we identify Ursa Major II, Ursa Minor, and Draco as the systems that would most benefit from additional stars being observed.},

  abstract = {The results of a wide-field survey of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy are presented. Our aims were to obtain an accurate map of the outer structure of Sculptor and to determine the level of interaction between this system and the Galaxy. Photometry was obtained in two colors down to the magnitude limits of V=20 and I=19, covering a 3.1d{\texttimes}3.1d area centered on Sculptor. The resulting color-magnitude data were used as a mask to select candidate horizontal-branch (HB) and red giant branch stars for this system. Previous work has shown that the red HB stars are more concentrated than the blue HB stars. We have determined the radial distributions of these two populations and show that the overall Sculptor density profile is well described by a two-component model based on a combination of these radial distributions. In addition, spectra of the Ca II triplet region were obtained for over 700 candidate red giant stars over the 10 deg2 region using the 2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These spectra were used to remove foreground Galactic stars based on radial velocity and Ca II triplet strength. The final list of Sculptor members contains 148 stars, 7 of which are located beyond the nominal tidal radius. Both the photometric and spectroscopic data sets indicate no significant extratidal structure. These results support at most a mild level of interaction between this system and the Galaxy, and we have measured an upper mass limit for extratidal material to be 2.3\%+/-0.6\% of the Sculptor luminous mass. This lack of tidal interaction indicates that previous velocity dispersion measurements (and hence the amount of dark matter detected) in this system are not strongly influenced by the Galactic tidal field.},

  abstract = {We present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. Our model is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in these simulations with stellar populations predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical evolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity function (LF) and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well with observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that accreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 7 from less than five significant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with stellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals (107-108 Msolar). In contrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these major contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the number of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently stochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which amplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo hosts. The masses ({\textasciitilde} 108-109 Msolar) and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes (from 10 to 100 kpc) are consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a complex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells and other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth models. The central regions ({$<$}10 kpc) of our haloes are highly prolate (c/a {\textasciitilde} 0.3), although we find one example of a massive accreted thick disc. Metallicity gradients in our haloes are typically significant only where the halo is built from a small number of satellites. We contrast the ages and metallicities of halo stars with surviving satellites, finding broad agreement with recent observations.},

  abstract = {In order to backward integrate the orbits of Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies, much effort has been invested in recent years to constrain their initial phase-space coordinates. Yet equally important are the assumptions on the potential that the dwarf galaxies experience over time, especially given the fact that the MW is currently accreting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In this work, using a dark-matter-only zoom-in simulation, we test whether the use of common parametric forms of the potential is adequate to successfully backward integrate the orbits of the subhaloes from their present-day positions. We parametrize the recovered orbits and compare them with those from the simulations. We find that simple symmetric parametric forms of the potential fail to capture the complexities and the inhomogeneities of the true potential experienced by the subhaloes. More specifically, modelling a recent massive accretion like that of the LMC as a sum of two spherical parametric potentials leads to substantial errors in the recovered parameters of the orbits. These errors rival those caused due to (a) a 30 per cent uncertainty in the virial mass of the MW and (b) not modelling the potential of the recently accreted massive satellite. Our work suggests that (i) the uncertainties in the parameters of the recovered orbits of some MW dwarfs may be underestimated and that (ii) researchers should characterize the uncertainties inherent to their choice of integration techniques and assumptions of the potential against cosmological zoom-in simulations of the MW, which include a recently accreted LMC.},

We use a one-zone chemical evolution model to fit the overall abundance patterns of {$\alpha$} elements (which probe the core-collapse supernovae that occur shortly after star formation), s-process elements (which probe AGB nucleosynthesis at intermediate delay times), and iron-peak elements (which probe delayed Type Ia supernovae). Our best-fit model indicates that Sculptor dSph has an ancient SFH, consistent with previous estimates from deep photometry. However, we derive a total star formation duration of {\textasciitilde}0.9 Gyr, which is shorter than photometrically derived SFHs. We explore the effect of various model assumptions on our measurement and find that modifications to these assumptions still produce relatively short SFHs of duration {$\lessequivlnt$}1.4 Gyr. Our model is also able to compare sets of predicted nucleosynthetic yields for supernovae and AGB stars, and can provide insight into the nucleosynthesis of individual elements in Sculptor dSph. We find that observed [Mn/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] trends are most consistent with sub-M Ch Type Ia supernova models, and that a combination of "prompt" (delay times similar to core-collapse supernovae) and "delayed" (minimum delay times {$\greaterequivlnt$}50 Myr) r-process events may be required to reproduce observed [Ba/Mg] and [Eu/Mg] trends.},

  abstract = {We use a suite of 31 simulated galaxies drawn from the MaGICC project to investigate the effects of baryonic feedback on the density profiles of dark matter haloes. The sample covers a wide mass range: 9.4 {\texttimes} 109 {$<$} Mhalo/ M{$\odot$} {$<$} 7.8 {\texttimes} 1011, hosting galaxies with stellar masses in the range 5.0 {\texttimes} 105 {$<$} M*/ M{$\odot$} {$<$} 8.3 {\texttimes} 1010, i.e. from dwarf to L*. The galaxies are simulated with blastwave supernova feedback and, for some of them, an additional source of energy from massive stars is included. Within this feedback scheme we vary several parameters, such as the initial mass function, the density threshold for star formation, and energy from supernovae and massive stars. The main result is a clear dependence of the inner slope of the dark matter density profile, {$\alpha$} in {$\rho$} {$\propto$} r{$\alpha$}, on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, M*/Mhalo. This relation is independent of the particular choice of parameters within our stellar feedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp versus core formation. When M*/Mhalo is low, {$\lessequivlnt$}0.01 per cent, energy from stellar feedback is insufficient to significantly alter the inner dark matter density, and the galaxy retains a cuspy profile. At higher stellar-to-halo mass ratios, feedback drives the expansion of the dark matter and generates cored profiles. The flattest profiles form where M*/Mhalo {$\sim$} 0.5 per cent. Above this ratio, stars formed in the central regions deepen the gravitational potential enough to oppose the supernova-driven expansion process, resulting in cuspier profiles. Combining the dependence of {$\alpha$} on M*/Mhalo with the empirical abundance matching relation between M* and Mhalo provides a prediction for how {$\alpha$} varies as a function of stellar mass. Further, using the Tully-Fisher relation allows a prediction for the dependence of the dark matter inner slope on the observed rotation velocity of galaxies. The most cored galaxies are expected to have Vrot {$\sim$} 50 km s-1, with {$\alpha$} decreasing for more massive disc galaxies: spirals with Vrot {$\sim$} 150 km s-1 have central slopes {$\alpha$} {$\leq$} -0.8, approaching again the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This novel prediction for the dependence of {$\alpha$} on disc galaxy mass can be tested using observational data sets and can be applied to theoretical modelling of mass profiles and populations of disc galaxies.},

Tidal mass-losses reshape CDM haloes, leaving behind bound remnants whose characteristic densities are set by the mean density of the host at the pericentre of their respective orbit. The evolution to the final bound remnant state is essentially complete after {\textasciitilde}5 orbits for nearly circular orbits, while reaching the same remnant requires, for the same pericentre, {\textasciitilde}25 and {\textasciitilde}40 orbits for eccentric orbits with 1:5 and 1:20 pericentre-to-apocentre ratios, respectively. The density profile of tidal remnants is fully specified by the fraction of mass lost, and approaches an exponentially truncated Navarro-Frenk-White profile in the case of heavy mass-loss. Resolving tidal remnants requires excellent numerical resolution; poorly resolved subhaloes have systematically lower characteristic densities and are more easily disrupted. Even simulations with excellent spatial and time resolution fail when the final remnant is resolved with fewer than 3000 particles. We derive a simple empirical model that describes the evolution of the mass and the density profile of the tidal remnant applicable to a wide range of orbital eccentricities and pericentric distances. Applied to the Milky Way, our results suggest that 108-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\$ haloes accreted \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ ago on 1:10 orbits with pericentric distance \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ should have been stripped to 0.1-1 per cent of their original mass.

  abstract = {The clumpiness of dark matter on sub-kpc scales is highly sensitive to the tidal evolution and survival of subhaloes. In agreement with previous studies, we show that N-body realisations of cold dark matter subhaloes with centrally-divergent density cusps form artificial constant-density cores on the scale of the resolution limit of the simulation. These density cores drive the artificial tidal disruption of subhaloes. We run controlled simulations of the tidal evolution of a single subhalo where we repeatedly reconstruct the density cusp, preventing artificial disruption. This allows us to follow the evolution of the subhalo for arbitrarily large fractions of tidally stripped mass. Based on this numerical evidence in combination with simple dynamical arguments, we argue that cuspy dark matter subhaloes cannot be completely disrupted by smooth tidal fields. Modelling stars as collisionless tracers of the underlying potential, we furthermore study the tidal evolution of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using a model of the Tucana III dwarf as an example, we show that tides can strip dwarf galaxies down to sub-solar luminosities. The remnant micro-galaxies would appear as co-moving groups of metal-poor, low-mass stars of similar age, embedded in sub-kpc dark matter subhaloes.},

This process strips preferentially particles with long orbital times, and comes to an end when the remaining bound particles have crossing times shorter than a fraction of the orbital time at pericentre. The properties of the final stellar remnant thus depend on the energy distribution of stars in the progenitor subhalo, which in turn depends on the initial density profile and radial segregation of the initial stellar component. The stellar component may be completely dispersed if its energy distribution does not extend all the way to the subhalo potential minimum, although a bound dark remnant may remain. These results imply that 'tidally limited' galaxies, defined as systems whose stellar components have undergone substantial tidal mass-loss, neither converge to a unique structure nor follow a single tidal track. On the other hand, tidally limited dwarfs do have characteristic sizes and velocity dispersions that trace directly the characteristic radius (rmx) and circular velocity (Vmx) of the subhalo remnant. This result places strong upper limits on the size of satellites whose unusually low velocity dispersions are often ascribed to tidal effects. In particular, the large size of kinematically cold 'feeble giant' satellites like Crater 2 or Antlia 2 cannot be explained as due to tidal effects alone in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter scenario.},

  abstract = {The recently-discovered stellar system Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest known Milky Way satellite to date. With a stellar mass of \$16{\textasciicircum}\{+6\}\_\{-5\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and a half-light radius of \$3{\textbackslash}pm1\$ pc, it is either the darkest galaxy ever discovered or the faintest self-gravitating star cluster known to orbit the Galaxy. Its line-of-sight velocity dispersion suggests the presence of dark matter, although current measurements are inconclusive because of the unknown contribution to the dispersion of potential binary stars. We use N-body simulations to show that, if self-gravitating, the system could not survive in the Milky Way tidal field for more than a single orbit (roughly 0.4 Gyr), which strongly suggests that the system is stabilized by the presence of large amounts of dark matter. If UMa3/U1 formed at the centre of a {\textasciitilde}\$10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ cuspy LCDM halo, its velocity dispersion would be predicted to be of order {\textasciitilde}1 km/s. This is roughly consistent with the current estimate, which, neglecting binaries, places \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm los\}\$ in the range 1 to 4 km/s. Because of its dense cusp, such a halo should be able to survive the Milky Way tidal field, keeping UMa3/U1 relatively unscathed until the present time. This implies that UMa3/U1 is in all likelihood the faintest and densest dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, with important implications for alternative dark matter models, and for the minimum halo mass threshold for luminous galaxy formation in the LCDM cosmology.},

  abstract = {The cuspy central density profiles of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes make them highly resilient to disruption by tides. Self-interactions between dark matter particles, or the cycling of baryons, may result in the formation of a constant-density core that would make haloes more susceptible to tidal disruption. We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW)-like `cored' subhaloes in the tidal field of a massive host, and identify the criteria and time-scales for full disruption. Our results imply that the survival of Milky Way satellites places constraints on the sizes of dark matter cores. We find that no subhaloes with cores larger than 1~per\,cent of their initial NFW scale radius can survive for a Hubble time on orbits with pericentres \$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim\} 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$. A satellite like Tucana~3, with pericentre \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 3.5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}\$, must have a core size smaller than \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 2{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\$ to survive just three orbital periods on its current orbit. The core sizes expected in self-interacting dark matter models with a velocity-independent cross-section~of \$1{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm{\textasciicircum}2\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ seem incompatible with ultrafaint satellites with small pericentric radii, such as Tuc~3, Seg~1, Seg~2, Ret~2, Tri~2, and Wil~1, as these should have fully disrupted if accreted on to the Milky Way \$\{{\textbackslash}gtrsim\} 10{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ ago. These results suggest that many satellites have vanishingly small core sizes, consistent with CDM cusps. The discovery of further Milky Way satellites on orbits with small pericentric radii would strengthen these conclusions and allow for stricter upper limits on the core sizes.},

  abstract = {A fundamental prediction of the Lambda cold dark matter cosmology is the centrally divergent cuspy density profile of dark matter haloes. Density cusps render cold dark matter haloes resilient to tides, and protect dwarf galaxies embedded in them from full tidal disruption. The hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way may therefore give rise to a population of "microgalaxies"; i.e., heavily stripped remnants of early accreted satellites, which can reach arbitrarily low luminosity. Assuming that the progenitor systems are dark matter dominated, we use an empirical formalism for tidal stripping to predict the evolution of the luminosity, size, and velocity dispersion of such remnants, tracing their tidal evolution across multiple orders of magnitude in mass and size. The evolutionary tracks depend sensitively on the progenitor distribution of stellar binding energies. We explore three cases that likely bracket most realistic models of dwarf galaxies: one where the energy distribution of the most tightly bound stars follows that of the dark matter, and two where stars are defined by either an exponential density or surface brightness profile. The tidal evolution in the size--velocity dispersion plane is quite similar for these three models, although their remnants may differ widely in luminosity. Microgalaxies are therefore best distinguished from globular clusters by the presence of dark matter; either directly, by measuring their velocity dispersion, or indirectly, by examining their tidal resilience. Our work highlights the need for further theoretical and observational constraints on the stellar energy distribution in dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract = {We study the response of mono-energetic stellar populations with initially isotropic kinematics to impulsive and adiabatic changes to an underlying dark matter potential. Half-light radii expand and velocity dispersions decrease as enclosed dark matter is removed. The details of this expansion and cooling depend on the time scale on which the underlying potential changes. In the adiabatic regime, the product of half-light radius and average velocity dispersion is conserved. We show that the stellar populations maintain centrally isotropic kinematics throughout their adiabatic evolution, and their densities can be approximated by a family of analytical radial profiles. Metallicity gradients within the galaxy flatten as dark matter is slowly removed. In the case of strong impulsive perturbations, stellar populations develop power-law-like density tails with radially biased kinematics. We show that the distribution of stellar binding energies within the dark matter halo substantially widens after an impulsive perturbation, no matter the sign of the perturbation. This allows initially energetically separated stellar populations to mix, to the extent that previously chemo-dynamically distinct populations may masquerade as a single population with large metallicity and energy spread. Finally, we show that in response to an impulsive perturbation, stellar populations that are deeply embedded in cored dark matter halos undergo a series of damped oscillations before reaching a virialised equilibrium state, driven by inefficient phase mixing in the harmonic potentials of cored halos. This slow return to equilibrium adds substantial systematic uncertainty to dynamical masses estimated from Jeans modeling or the virial theorem.},

  abstract = {The radial profile of the Sculptor dwarf elliptical galaxy has been determined from automated star counts of UK Schmidt Telescope Unit (UKSTU) plates. The ellipticity (e = 0.34 +/- 0.04) and position angle (P.A.(1950.0) = 95.4{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum} +/- 4.3{\textasciicircum}deg{\textasciicircum}) are in agreement with those determined by Hodge (1961b). These profiles have been compared with King (1966) models with a range of tidal and core radii. None have been found to give an excellent fit. The best fit achieved has r\_t\_ = 95' and r\_c\_ = 8.9', and has a standard deviation of {$\sigma$} = 0.28 and {$\chi$}{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} = 0.71 (indicating a 95+ \% confidence limit). Accepting these as roughly the correct values for the core and tidal radii, and using other data from the literature, the mass of the Galaxy has been estimated as M\_G\_{\textasciitilde}1.5 +/- 1.1 X 10{\textasciicircum}11{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_. However, the data deviate from this model significantly at large radii, there is an observed overdensity above that expected for the King model beyond R\_maj\_ = 50'. This overdensity is roughly a 2{$\sigma$} effect above the determined background level, and accounts for {\textasciitilde}13\% of the stars counted. This compares well with the results of Innanen and Papp (1979) that {\textasciitilde}10\% of Sculptor's variable stars are found beyond R\_maj\_=53' (Hodge's 1961b value for r\_t\_). Exponential law fits have also been made, following the suggestion (Faber and Lin 1983) that the halo dwarfs are as well fit by exponential laws as are many disk systems. The mean best fit has an exponential scale of {$\gamma$}= -0.053 +/- 0.001 arcmin{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}, with a standard deviation of {$\sigma$}= 0.51 and {$\chi$}{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} = 3.8 (still a 95\% + confidence limit). Given the distance modulus of Kunkel and Demers (1977), this implies a physical scale length of r\_e\_{\textasciitilde}0.43 kpc. While the data show the same excess with respect to the exponential law fits as found for the King model fits, this excess is not more severe than is seen in many disk systems. The current data, therefore, do not argue against the hypothesis that the halo dwarfs are the results of ram-pressure stripping of dI systems by the Galactic halo.},

  abstract = {The two-dimensional structure of the Sculptor dwarf elliptical galaxy has been investigated using automated starcounts from United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope Unit (UKSTU) plates. The overall shape of the 2-D contours is similar to that obtained by Hodge (1961b). The existence of nonsymmetric structure in Sculptor has been probed by fitting the starcount data with smooth, symmetric, concentric elliptical contours, then subtracting these fits from the actual data and examining the residual maps. Significant asymmetries are found in the data from all plates, with a maximum density contrast of {\textasciitilde} + 30\% above what is expected for a symmetric fit. All the structure clearly detected is at distances less than or on the order of the core radius. These structures have a physical size of {\textasciitilde}150 pc, and a core crossing time of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8{\textasciicircum} yr. This would seem to imply that they are either bound, or are very young structures. It is possible, however, that they are remnant high-energy star groups, of the sort conjectured by Hodge and Michie (1969), left over from the formation epoch of the system. Calculations following work by Tremaine (1981) indicate that the structures seen should have a decay time due to interaction with the Sculptor core of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10{\textasciicircum} yr, which is roughly the apparent age of the bulk of Sculptor stars (DaCosta 1984). An estimate of the current ratio of kinetic to potential energy for these structures reinforces the supposition that they are currently dissipating in the tidal field of the Sculptor core.},

This quantity is essentially the gravitational torque and it roughly provides the ellipticity projected along the line of sight. We show that the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), with a single epoch of observations combined with those of the Gaia Space Telescope, can distinguish the {$\Lambda$}CDM value of the torque from zero for each Sculptor-like dwarf galaxy with a confidence between 0 and 5{$\sigma$}, depending on the orientation of each halo. With two epochs of observations, TMT will achieve a 5{$\sigma$} discovery of torque and thus asphericity for most such galaxies, thus providing a new and powerful test of the {$\Lambda$}CDM model.},

We develop a convolutional mixture density neural network model to derive a probability density function (PDF) of the inner density slopes of DM haloes. We train the network on simulated dwarf galaxies from the NIHAO and AURIGA projects, which include both DM cusps and cores: line-of-sight velocities and 2D spatial distributions of their stars are used as inputs to obtain a PDF representing the probability of predicting a specific inner slope. The model recovers accurately the expected DM profiles: \${\textbackslash}sim 82\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the galaxies have a derived inner slope within {\textpm}0.1 of their true value, while \${\textbackslash}sim 98\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ within {\textpm}0.3. We apply our model to four Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies and find results consistent with those obtained with the Jeans modelling based code GRAVSPHERE: the Fornax dSph has a strong indication of possessing a central DM core, Carina and Sextans have cusps (although the latter with large uncertainties), while Sculptor shows a double peaked PDF indicating that a cusp is preferred, but a core cannot be ruled out. Our results show that simulation-based inference with neural networks provide a innovative and complementary method for the determination of the inner matter density profiles in galaxies, which in turn can help constrain the properties of the elusive DM.},

The full release, Gaia DR3, will add radial velocities, spectra, light curves, and astrophysical parameters for a large subset of the sources, as well as orbits for solar system objects. Aims: Before the publication of the catalogue, many different data items have undergone dedicated validation processes. The goal of this paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness, accuracy, and precision for the Gaia EDR3 data and to provide recommendations for the use of the catalogue data. Methods: The validation processes include a systematic analysis of the catalogue contents to detect anomalies, either individual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis and comparisons to the previous release as well as to external data and to models. Results: Gaia EDR3 represents a major step forward, compared to Gaia DR2, in terms of precision, accuracy, and completeness for both astrometry and photometry.

These pairs are much closer than expected by chance if the radial and angular distributions of satellites were uncorrelated; in addition, they have very similar line-of-sight velocities and luminosities that differ by less than three magnitudes. In contrast, the same criteria pair fewer than 4 per cent of satellites in N-body/semi-analytic models that match the radial distribution and luminosity function of Local Group satellites. If confirmed in studies of larger samples, the high frequency of dwarf galaxy pairings may provide interesting clues to the formation of faint galaxies in the current cosmological paradigm.},

  abstract = {The shallow faint-end slope of the galaxy mass function is usually reproduced in {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) galaxy formation models by assuming that the fraction of baryons that turn into stars drops steeply with decreasing halo mass and essentially vanishes in haloes with maximum circular velocities Vmax {$<$} 20-30 km s-1. Dark-matter-dominated dwarfs should therefore have characteristic velocities of about that value, unless they are small enough to probe only the rising part of the halo circular velocity curve (i.e. half-mass radii, r1/2 {$\ll$} 1 kpc). Many dwarfs have properties in disagreement with this prediction: they are large enough to probe their halo Vmax but their characteristic velocities are well below 20 km s-1. These 'cold faint giants' (an extreme example is the recently discovered Crater 2 Milky Way satellite) can only be reconciled with our {$\Lambda$}CDM models if they are the remnants of once massive objects heavily affected by tidal stripping. We examine this possibility using the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group. Assuming that low-velocity-dispersion satellites have been affected by stripping, we infer their progenitor masses, radii, and velocity dispersions, and find them in remarkable agreement with those of isolated dwarfs. Tidal stripping also explains the large scatter in the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation in the dwarf galaxy regime: tides remove preferentially dark matter from satellite galaxies, lowering their accelerations below the amin {\textasciitilde} 10-11 m s-2 minimum expected for isolated dwarfs. In many cases, the resulting velocity dispersions are inconsistent with the predictions from Modified Newtonian Dynamics, a result that poses a possibly insurmountable challenge to that scenario.},

  abstract = {We investigate a wide range of possible evolutionary histories for the recently discovered Bootes dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a Milky Way satellite. By means of N-body simulations, we follow the evolution of possible progenitor galaxies of Bootes for a variety of orbits in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way. The progenitors considered cover the range from dark matter-free star clusters to massive, dark matter-dominated outcomes of cosmological simulations. For each type of progenitor and orbit, we compare the observable properties of the remnant after 10 Gyr with those of Bootes observed today. Our study suggests that the progenitor of Bootes must have been, and remains now, dark matter-dominated. In general, our models are unable to reproduce the observed high velocity dispersion in Bootes without dark matter. Our models do not support time-dependent tidal effects as a mechanism able to inflate significantly the internal velocity dispersion. As none of our initially spherical models is able to reproduce the elongation of Bootes, our results suggest that the progenitor of Bootes may have had some intrinsic flattening. Although the focus of this paper is the Bootes dwarf spheroidal, these models may be of general relevance to understanding the structure, stability and dark matter content of all dwarf spheroidal galaxies.},

This Bayesian inference tool calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions. The developments presented here lead to further substantial improvements in sampling efficiency and robustness, as compared to the original algorithm presented in Feroz \& Hobson, which itself significantly outperformed existing Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in a wide range of astrophysical inference problems. The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/. It will also be released as part of the SUPERBAYES package, for the analysis of supersymmetric theories of particle physics, at http://www.superbayes.org.},

  abstract = {Supernova and multiple supernova events regulate several structural properties of dwarf galaxies. In particular, they govern the metal enrichment and the energy budget of the ISM; they might induce partial (blowout) or total (blowaway) gas removal from the galaxy; they also regulate the pressure of the ISM, and consequently the morphology of the galactic gaseous body. Significant amounts of dark matter may play an equally important role: the dark matter gravitational potential tends to concentrate baryons towards the centre, thus enhancing both the star formation rate and the metal production. Also, the dynamical properties of the ISM, and the occurrence of a blowout or blowaway, are shown to be determined by the dark matter content. We present detailed analytical/numerical models describing the evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIs), including the above and other effects. The main results are: (i) dwarfs with total masses M{$\lessequivlnt$}5{\texttimes}106 M{$\odot$} are blown away; those with gas masses up to {$\simeq$}109 M{$\odot$} lose mass in an outflow; (ii) metallicities are found to correlate tightly with dark matter content, and are consistent with a range of dark-to-visible mass ratios {$\varphi\approx$}0--30, with about 65 per cent of the dwarfs in the sample having {$\varphi\approx$}0--10; (iii) we predict a lower limit to the oxygen abundance in dIs of 12+log(O/H){$\approx$}7.2; (iv) outflows are not particularly important for the metallicity evolution of dwarf galaxies, and certainly less important than star formation for gas consumption; however, dwarfs with gas masses of a few {\texttimes}108 M{$\odot$} are shown to be the major pollutants of the IGM; (v) the ISM H i velocity dispersion correlates with metallicity and, independently of dark matter, scales as Z3.5. Specific comparisons with well-studied dIs, such as for example Leo A, yield excellent agreement with the data. Based on our results, we discuss a scenario in which late-type and early-type dwarfs had common progenitors in the past, but differences in their total mass forced these objects to follow different evolutionary paths. We therefore consider dI{$\rightarrow$}dE transitions occurring at present cosmic times as very unlikely.},

  abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here, we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in time-scales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial condition generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release, Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (GBP - GRP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, GBP, and GRP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30-40\% for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, GBP, and GRP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1\% level},

  abstract = {Context. We present the third data release of the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, Gaia DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of Gaia sources. Aims: We outline the content and the properties of Gaia DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release. Methods: The Gaia DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. Results: The Gaia DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G, GBP, and GRP pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, Gaia EDR3. Gaia DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges GRVS {$<$} 14 and 3100 {$<$} Teff {$<$} 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide GRVS magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community. The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. Gaia DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy. Conclusions: This data release represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in Gaia DR3 will unleash the full potential of Gaia's exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.},

Assuming a velocity dispersion of 15 km s-1 for the ionized gas, we set limits of IH{$\alpha<$}=0.024 R and IH{$\alpha<$}=0.021 R for the Draco and Ursa Minor dSphs, respectively, averaged over our 1{$^\circ$} circular beam. Adopting a simple model for the ionized interstellar medium, these limits translate to upper bounds on the mass of ionized gas of {$<$}{\textasciitilde}10\% of the stellar mass, or {\textasciitilde}10 times the upper limits for the mass of neutral hydrogen. Note that the Draco and Ursa Minor dSphs could contain substantial amounts of interstellar gas, equivalent to all of the gas injected by dying stars since the end of their main star-forming episodes {$>$}{\textasciitilde}8 Gyr in the past, without violating these limits on the mass of ionized gas.},

  abstract = {Indications of disequilibrium throughout the Milky Way (MW) highlight the need for compact, flexible, non-parametric descriptions of phase-space distributions of galaxies. We present a new representation of the current dark matter (DM) distribution and potential derived from N-body simulations of the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) system using basis function expansions (BFEs). We incorporate methods to maximize the physical signal in the representation. As a result, the simulations of 108 DM particles representing the distorted MW(MW+LMC) system can be described by {\textasciitilde}236(2067) coefficients. We find that the LMC induces asymmetric perturbations (odd l, m) to the MW's halo, which are inconsistent with oblate, prolate, or triaxial halos. Furthermore, the energy in high order even modes (l, m {$>$} 2) is similar to average triaxial halos found in cosmological simulations. As such, the response of the MW's halo to the LMC must be accounted for in order to recover the imprints of its assembly history. The LMC causes the outer halo ({$>$}30 kpc) to shift from the disk center of mass (COM) by {\textasciitilde}15-25 kpc at present day, manifesting as a dipole in the BFE and in the radial velocities of halo stars. The shift depends on the LMC's infall mass, the distortion of the LMC's halo and the MW halo response.Within 30 kpc, halo tracers are expected to orbit the COM of the MW's disk, regardless of LMC infall mass. The LMC's halo is also distorted by MW tides; we discuss the implications for its mass loss and the subsequent effects on current Magellanic satellites.},

The 3.6 {$\mu$}m observations have been acquired with the Infrared Array Camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope as part of the SMHASH program. Mid-infrared light curves for 42 RRLs were obtained, from which we measured Sculptor's distance modulus to be {$\mu$} = 19.60 {\textpm} 0.02 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.04 (photometric) mag (with {$\sigma$}sys = 0.09 mag), using the 3.6 {$\mu$}m empirical period-luminosity relations derived from the Galactic globular cluster M4, or {$\mu$} = 19.57 {\textpm} 0.02 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.04 (photometric) mag (with {$\sigma$}sys = 0.11 mag) using empirical relations in the same passband recently derived from the Large Magellanic Cloud globular cluster Reticulum. Both these measurements are in good agreement with values presented in previous works with Sculptor RRLs in optical bands, and are also consistent with recent near-infrared RR Lyrae results. Best agreement with the literature is found for the latter modulus which is equivalent to a distance of d = 82 {\textpm} 1 (statistical) {\textpm} 2 (photometric) kpc (with {$\sigma$}sys = 4 kpc). Finally, using a subsample of RRLs with spectroscopic metallicities, we demonstrate that these distance estimates are not affected by metallicity effects.},

  abstract = {Aims. We used RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia third data release (DR3) to explore the outskirts of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) and update the census of its variable star population. Methods. We adopted different tools based on the Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data (proper motions, Period--Wesenheit--Metallicity relations, spatial distribution, colour--magnitude diagram and stellar isochrone fitting) to discriminate between different types of variable stars, and to identify UMi members. Results. We found a total of 129 RR Lyrae stars and 10 Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) that belong to UMi. In this paper we report 47 new RR Lyrae stars (46 bona fide and 1 candidate) and 5 new ACs (4 bona fide and 1 candidate), including new possible members in the extreme periphery of the galaxy at a distance of {$\sim$}12 half-light radii. We reclassified 13 RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study pipeline for Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS Cep\&RRL), using data from the literature and Gaia astrometry and photometry. Specifically, we assigned these 13 DR3 RR Lyrae stars to ten Anomalous Cepheids and three doublemode RR Lyrae (RRd), respectively. From the average luminosity of the RR Lyrae stars we derive for UMi a distance modulus of (m - M)0 = 19.23 {\textpm} 0.11 mag, in excellent agreement with the literature. Finally, we investigated whether some of UMi's variable stars might be members of the ultra-faint stellar cluster Mu{\~n}oz 1 that lies at a projected distance of 45' from UMi's centre. Based on the properties of the variable stars (distances, colours, and metallicities), we find it unlikely that they belong to the cluster.},

  abstract = {We introduce a set of high-resolution dissipationless simulations that model the Local Group (LG) in a cosmological context: Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations (ELVIS). The suite contains 48 Galaxy-size haloes, each within high-resolution volumes that span 2-5 Mpc in size, and each resolving thousands of systems with masses below the atomic cooling limit. Half of the ELVIS galaxy haloes are in paired configurations similar to the Milky Way (MW) and M31; the other half are isolated, mass-matched analogues. We find no difference in the abundance or kinematics of substructure within the virial radii of isolated versus paired hosts. On Mpc scales, however, LG-like pairs average almost twice as many companions and the velocity field is kinematically hotter and more complex. We present a refined abundance matching relation between stellar mass and halo mass that reproduces the observed satellite stellar mass functions of the MW and M31 down to the regime where incompleteness is an issue, M* {$\sim$} 5 {\texttimes} 105 M{$\odot$}. Within a larger region spanning approximately 3 Mpc, the same relation predicts that there should be {$\sim$}1000 galaxies with M* {$>$} 103 M{$\odot$} awaiting discovery. We show that up to 50 per cent of haloes within 1 Mpc of the MW or M31 could be systems that have previously been within the virial radius of either giant. By associating never accreted haloes with gas-rich dwarfs, we show that there are plausibly 50 undiscovered dwarf galaxies with H I masses {$>$}105 M{$\odot$} within the local volume. The radial velocity distribution of these predicted gas-rich dwarfs can be used to inform follow-up searches based on ultracompact high-velocity clouds found in the ALFALFA survey.},

  abstract = {The existence of two kinematically and chemically distinct stellar subpopulations in the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies offers the opportunity to constrain the density profile of their matter haloes by measuring the mass contained within the well-separated half-light radii of the two metallicity subpopulations. Walker and Pe{\~n}arrubia have used this approach to argue that data for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their inner regions and rule out `cuspy' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high statistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor. We test the validity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment) {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all have NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct metallicity subpopulations reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a method analogous to that of Walker and Pe{\~n}arrubia to a sample of 50 simulated dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although multiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based. The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different asphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the density profile are inferred depending on the angle from which the galaxy is viewed.},

In particular the derived value in the core of Fornax (0.3) is much lower than expected for a normal old stellar population. Conversely, the velocity-dispersion measurements in Draco and Ursa Minor appear to still require dark matter in MOND.

For isolated systems with stars of uniform mass, we discuss aspects of evolution up to the point of core collapse: relaxation and its N-dependence, the evolution of the density profile, the development of the velocity dispersion and anisotropy, and the rate of stellar escape.We find that the continuum models (gas and Fokker--Planck) agree quite accurately with N-body simulations in which N is of order of a few hundred. Small deviations from these models are present at small radii and at radii from the half-mass radius outwards. They are probably associated with binary activity and with the development of anisotropy, respectively. As expected, the N-body systems are strongly anisotropic in the outer half of the mass, while in the core the velocity distribution is isotropic to good approximation. Anisotropy has a very important influence on the rate of escape of stars.We also estimate quite reliable values for the coefficient \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ in the Coulomb logarithm ln\$({\textbackslash}gamma N)\$ and the conductivity coefficient C in the gas model of Lynden-Bell \&amp; Eggleton.

The resulting formulas can be applied to any photometric system, provided that the zero-points are specified by means of either ABmag, STmag, VEGAmag, or a standard star system that includes well-known spectrophotometric standards. Interstellar absorption can be considered in a self-consistent way. (2) We assemble an extended and updated library of stellar intrinsic spectra. It is mostly based on ``non-overshooting'' ATLAS9 models, suitably extended to both low and high effective temperatures. This offers an excellent coverage of the parameter space of T\_eff, log g, and [M/H]. We briefly discuss the main uncertainties and points still deserving more improvement.

  abstract = {Dwarf satellite galaxies undergo strong tidal forces produced by the main galaxy potential. These forces disturb the satellite and produce asymmetries in its stellar distribution, tidal tail formation, and modifications of the velocity dispersion profiles. Most of these features are observed in the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which is one of the closest satellites of the Milky Way. These features show that UMi is being tidally disrupted and is probably not in virial equilibrium. The high-velocity dispersion of UMi would also be a reflection of this tidal disruption and is not the signature of the large dark matter content that would be deduced if virial equilibrium is assumed. In order to avoid the uncertainty produced when virial equilibrium is assumed in systems in strong tidal fields, we present a new method of calculating the mass-to-luminosity ratio of disrupted dwarf galaxies. This method is based on numerical simulations and only takes into account the shape of the dwarf density profile and the tidal tail brightness, but it does not depend on the kinematics of the dwarf. Applying this method to UMi, we obtain a mass-to-luminosity relation of 12, which is lower than the value obtained assuming virial equilibrium (M/L=60). In addition, if UMi has a large dark matter content, it will be impossible to reproduce a tidal tail as luminous as the one observed.},

Near pericentre at 120 AU {$\approx$} 1400 Schwarzschild radii, the star has an orbital speed of {$\approx$}7650 km s-1, such that the first-order effects of Special and General Relativity have now become detectable with current capabilities. Over the past 26 years, we have monitored the radial velocity and motion on the sky of S2, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics instruments on the ESO Very Large Telescope, and since 2016 and leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018, with the four-telescope interferometric beam-combiner instrument GRAVITY. From data up to and including pericentre, we robustly detect the combined gravitational redshift and relativistic transverse Doppler effect for S2 of z = {$\Delta\lambda$} / {$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 200 km s-1/c with different statistical analysis methods. When parameterising the post-Newtonian contribution from these effects by a factor f , with f = 0 and f = 1 corresponding to the Newtonian and general relativistic limits, respectively, we find from posterior fitting with different weighting schemes f = 0.90 {\textpm} 0.09{\textbar}stat {\textpm} 0.15{\textbar}sys. The S2 data are inconsistent with pure Newtonian dynamics. This paper is dedicated to Tal Alexander, who passed away about a week before the pericentre approach of S2.},

  abstract = {My Thesis on "Stellar Population Studies in Nearby Galaxies" covers the development of new tools for stellar population studies, study of young Magellanic Cloud (MC) clusters and their surroundings study of old and intermediate-age populations in two dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. The new tools for population studies include the removal of extinction considering its dependence on stellar temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity (e.g., Grebel \& Roberts 1995), and the determination of age, metallicity, reddening, and distance through simultaneous isochrone fitting to multi-colour photometry (Grebel et al. 1994a). The young SMC cluster NGC 330 is considered a cornerstone for understanding stellar evolution in metal-poor environments. I investigate why previous [Fe/H] determinations for this cluster differ by more than 1 dex and show that they can be largely reconciled when using the same reddening. Different star formation mechanisms seem to have been at work for clusters of similar age. Large-scale star formation processes in the field appear to have triggered the collapse of the molecular clouds that formed NGC 330 and NGC 2004 in the LMC, while the surrounding field of NGC 1818 in the LMC is older than the cluster itself (Grebel 1996). Previous studies found several bright blue stars in young MC clusters to be giants spectroscopically and to lie in the blue Hertzsprung gap suggesting that stellar evolutionary theories may need to be revised and that large age spreads exist in these clusters. We argue (Grebel et al. 1996) that these stars probably are core H burning main-sequence stars that appear as blue stragglers resulting from binary evolution and/or rapid rotation. Many are Be stars and likely rapid rotators. Blue stragglers are also present in NGC 1818, NGC 2004, and NGC 2100 and possibly in all young clusters in the MCs. This suggests that (1) previously inferred large spreads in star formation times are much smaller, (2) ages of young MC clusters may have been systematically underestimated by mistaking blue stragglers for the main-sequence turnoff, and (3) the upper slopes of the IMFs may need to be re-evaluated (Grebel et al. 1996). With an efficient photometric survey method for emission-line stars (Grebel et al. 1992, 1994b, Grebel 1996) we investigated the Be star content of young MC clusters. In NGC 330 also variable Be stars and binaries were identified. NGC 330 and the slightly older NGC 1818 are very rich in Be stars (Grebel 1996), while NGC 2004 has a lower Be star content despite similar metallicity and age. H-alpha luminosity and infrared excess are well correlated though they do not seem to depend on spectral class, while H-alpha luminosity and ultraviolet excess are only weakly correlated. For the Sculptor and Fornax dSph galaxies we established the existence of subpopulations distinct in metallicity and in age (Grebel et al. 1994a). In Sculptor old and metal-poor populations dominate. In Fornax, we find a mixture of intermediate-age field populations and an age gradient with galactocentric radius. The lack of a distinguishable old field population, the metallicity spread in Fornax's globular clusters, and their larger age indicate that they may not have formed in Fornax itself. On the other hand, the suggested 1 Gyr-old subgiants may instead represent a sparsely populated horizontal branch of the missing old field population. Fornax's intermediate-age field population formed over a period of about 10 Gyr and shows considerable enrichment, while Sculptor's populations are comparatively well-confined in ages and abundances. The impact on evolutionary scenarios of the Local Group is discussed.

If further work eliminates this possibility, then, assuming dynamical equilibrium, isotropy in the velocity dispersion (which is 6.7\_-0.8\_{\textasciicircum}+0.9{\textasciicircum} km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} when the rotation has been subtracted) and a negligible contribution from binary stars, the core mass-to-light ratio is 59\_-25\_{\textasciicircum}+41{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_/L\_sun\_ and the total mass-to-light ratio is 40\_-17\_{\textasciicircum}+29{\textasciicircum} M\_sun\_/L\_sun\_, implying the presence of large quantities of dark matter.},

  abstract = {Dwarf irregulars (dIrrs) are among the most common type of galaxy in the Universe. They typically have gas-rich, low surface-brightness, metal-poor, and relatively-thick disks. Here we summarize the current state of our knowledge of the interstellar medium (ISM), including atomic, molecular and ionized gas, along with their dust properties and metals. We also discuss star formation feedback, gas accretion, and mergers with other dwarfs that connect the ISM to the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. We highlight one of the most persistent mysteries: the nature of pervasive gas that is yet undetected as either molecular or cold hydrogen, the ``dark gas''. Here are a few highlights: 1. Significant quantities of HI are in far-outer gas disks. 2. Cold HI in dIrrs would be molecular in the Milky Way, making the chemical properties of star-forming clouds significantly different. 3. Stellar feedback has a much larger impact in dIrrs than in spiral galaxies. 4. The escape fraction of ionizing photons is significant, making dIrrs a plausible source for reionization in the early Universe. 5. Observations suggest a significantly higher abundance of hydrogen (H\$\_2\$ or cold HI) associated with CO in star-forming regions than that traced by the CO alone.},

Global and central mass-to-light ratios were calculated for these galaxies. They range from {\textasciitilde}=10 for Fornax and Sculptor to more than 200 for Draco. It appears plausible that Draco, Ursa Minor, Carina and Sextans contain significant amounts of dark matter, at least under the standard assumptions for the dynamics of these galaxies. However, the errors associated with these estimates remain - often forbiddingly - large, dominated (in most cases) by the errors in the luminosity and velocity dispersion. The possibility of the presence of extra-tidal stars in at least some of the dSphs is also discussed, together with the effect of the Galactic tidal field on the dSphs' morphology. Both Sextans and Sculptor appear to be good candidates for systems in the process of tidal disruption.},

Other dynamical consequences are briefly discussed, and the mass of our Galaxy is found to be 220 billion solar masses times the M/L ratio of Sculptor.

  abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) appear to be some of the most dark matter (DM)-dominated objects in the Universe. Their dynamical masses are commonly derived using the kinematics of stars under the assumption of equilibrium. However, these objects are satellites of massive galaxies (e.g. the Milky Way) and thus can be influenced by their tidal fields. We investigate the implication of the assumption of equilibrium focusing on the Sculptor dSph by means of ad hoc N-body simulations tuned to reproduce the observed properties of Sculptor following the evolution along some observationally motivated orbits in the Milky Way gravitational field. For this purpose, we used state-of-the-art spectroscopic and photometric samples of Sculptor's stars. We found that the stellar component of the simulated object is not directly influenced by the tidal field, while \{{$\approx$} \} 30 - 60\{\{ per cent\}\} of the mass of the more diffuse DM halo is stripped. We conclude that, considering the most recent estimate of the Sculptor proper motion, the system is not affected by the tides and the stellar kinematics represents a robust tracer of the internal dynamics. In the simulations that match the observed properties of Sculptor, the present-day dark-to-luminous mass ratio is {$\approx$}6 within the stellar half-light radius ({$\approx$}0.3 kpc) and {$>$}50 within the maximum radius of the analysed data set ({$\approx$}1.5{$^\circ$}, {$\approx$}2 kpc).},

  abstract = {Dwarf galaxies are valuable laboratories for dynamical studies related to dark matter and galaxy evolution, yet it is currently unknown just how physically extended their stellar components are. Satellites orbiting the Galaxy's potential may undergo tidal stripping by the host, or alternatively, may themselves have accreted smaller systems whose debris populates the dwarf's own stellar halo. Evidence of these past interactions, if present, is best searched for in the outskirts of the satellite. However, foreground contamination dominates the signal at these large radial distances, making observation of stars in these regions difficult. In this work, we introduce an updated algorithm for application to Gaia data that identifies candidate member stars of dwarf galaxies, based on spatial, colour-magnitude and proper motion information, and which allows for an outer component to the stellar distribution. Our method shows excellent consistency with spectroscopically confirmed members from the literature despite having no requirement for radial velocity information. We apply the algorithm to all {\textasciitilde}60 Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites, and we find nine dwarfs (Bo{\"o}tes 1, Bo{\"o}tes 3, Draco 2, Grus 2, Segue 1, Sculptor, Tucana 2, Tucana 3, and Ursa Minor) that exhibit evidence for a secondary, low-density outer profile. We identify many member stars which are located beyond 5 half-light radii (and in some cases, beyond 10). We argue these distant stars are likely tracers of dwarf stellar haloes or tidal streams, though ongoing spectroscopic follow-up will be required to determine the origin of these extended stellar populations.},

We find that existing observations are not sufficient to allow us to place precise limits on either the orbit or the initial state of the dwarf. Debris from the ongoing tidal stripping of the Sagittarius galaxy are expected to form moving groups in the halo of the Galaxy, and the discovery of such stars would strongly constrain the history and dynamical state of the dwarf Furthermore, if Sgr is presently being disrupted, we predict that its remains will be detectable as a moving group in the halo for more than 1 Gyr. Thus, if similar accretion events have occurred in the recent history of the Galaxy, their after effects may still be observable.},

The first two epochs, the subject of past analyses, were obtained with ACS/HRC, and have been reanalyzed here. The new third epoch with WFC3/UVIS increases the time baseline and provides better control of systematics. The three-epoch data yield proper-motion random errors of only 1\%-2\% per field. For the LMC this is sufficient to constrain the internal proper-motion dynamics, as will be discussed in a separate paper. Here we focus on the implied center-of-mass proper motions: {$\mu$} W, LMC = -1.910 {\textpm} 0.020 mas yr-1, {$\mu$} N, LMC = 0.229 {\textpm} 0.047 mas yr-1, and {$\mu$} W, SMC = -0.772 {\textpm} 0.063 mas yr-1, {$\mu$} N, SMC = -1.117 {\textpm} 0.061 mas yr-1. We combine the results with a revised understanding of the solar motion in the Milky Way to derive Galactocentric velocities: v tot, LMC = 321 {\textpm} 24 km s-1 and v tot, SMC = 217 {\textpm} 26 km s-1. Our proper-motion uncertainties are now dominated by limitations in our understanding of the internal kinematics and geometry of the Clouds, and our velocity uncertainties are dominated by distance errors. Orbit calculations for the Clouds around the Milky Way allow a range of orbital periods, depending on the uncertain masses of the Milky Way and LMC. Periods {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 4 Gyr are ruled out, which poses a challenge for traditional Magellanic Stream models. First-infall orbits are preferred (as supported by other arguments as well) if one imposes the requirement that the LMC and SMC must have been a bound pair for at least several Gyr.},

  abstract = {New observations make it possible to re-examine the question of the density distribution in globular clusters. Jeans' law is based on insufficient observations and on an incorrect theory. On Palomar Schmidt plates the densities can be followed far enough out to define a limit to a globular cluster. The observed loca- tion of this limit agrees with the limit to be expected as a result of galactic tidal forces. The central regions of all globular clusters are similar, except for the effect of the tidal cutoff. An empirical formula has been found that represents the density from center to edge in globular clusters of all degrees of central concen- tration. The formula has three parameters, which is the minimum number permitted by the physical circum- stances. Globular clusters are therefore as similar in structure as they could possibly be. Galactic clusters and Sculptor-type dwarf galaxies also appear to follow the same density law. From dynamical considerations it would appear that all these stellar systems are subject to two types of relaxation, which produce nearly identical effects. The first relaxation is produced by the initial mixing of the system. Thereupon stellar encounters slowly change the density parameters without affecting the basic law. Relative to globular clusters, giant elliptical galaxies have an excess of brightness near the center. This difference can be explained as a result of relaxation, equipartition, and an excess of dwarf stars.},

This is the largest sample of individual {$\alpha$} element (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) abundance measurements in any single dSph. The measurements are made from Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrometer medium-resolution spectra (6400-9000 {\AA}, R {\textasciitilde} 6500). Based on comparisons to published high-resolution (R gsim 20,000) spectroscopic measurements, our measurements have uncertainties of {$\sigma$}[Fe/H] = 0.14 and {$\sigma$}[{$\alpha$}/Fe] = 0.13. The Sculptor [Fe/H] distribution has a mean lang[Fe/H]rang = -1.58 and is asymmetric with a long, metal-poor tail, indicative of a history of extended star formation. Sculptor has a larger fraction of stars with [Fe/H] {$<$} -2 than the MW halo. We have discovered one star with [Fe/H] = -3.80 {\textpm} 0.28, which is the most metal-poor star known anywhere except the MW halo, but high-resolution spectroscopy is needed to measure this star's detailed abundances. As has been previously reported based on high-resolution spectroscopy, [{$\alpha$}/Fe] in Sculptor falls as [Fe/H] increases. The metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.5) have lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe] than Galactic halo field stars of comparable metallicity. This indicates that star formation proceeded more gradually in Sculptor than in the Galactic halo. We also observe radial abundance gradients of -0.030 {\textpm} 0.003 dex arcmin-1 in [Fe/H] and +0.013 {\textpm} 0.003 dex arcmin-1 in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] out to 11 arcmin (275 pc). Together, these measurements cast Sculptor and possibly other surviving dSphs as representative of the dwarf galaxies from which the metal-poor tail of the Galactic halo formed.},

  abstract = {We present spectroscopic metallicities of individual stars in seven gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs), and we show that dIrrs obey the same mass-metallicity relation as the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of both the Milky Way and M31: Z\_* {\textbackslash}propto M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{0.30+/- 0.02\}. The uniformity of the relation is in contradiction to previous estimates of metallicity based on photometry. This relationship is roughly continuous with the stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation for galaxies as massive as M * = 1012 M {$\odot$}. Although the average metallicities of dwarf galaxies depend only on stellar mass, the shapes of their metallicity distributions depend on galaxy type. The metallicity distributions of dIrrs resemble simple, leaky box chemical evolution models, whereas dSphs require an additional parameter, such as gas accretion, to explain the shapes of their metallicity distributions. Furthermore, the metallicity distributions of the more luminous dSphs have sharp, metal-rich cut-offs that are consistent with the sudden truncation of star formation due to ram pressure stripping. The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

  abstract = {The nearby Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal (UMi dSph) is one of the most dark matter-dominated galaxies known, with a central mass-to-light ratio M/L{\textasciitilde}70. Somewhat anomalously, it appears to contain morphological substructure in the form of a second peak in the stellar number density. It is often argued that this substructure must be transient, because it could not survive for the {\textasciitilde}12 Gyr age of the system, given the crossing time implied by UMi's 8.8 km s-1 internal velocity dispersion. In this Letter, however, we present evidence that the substructure has a cold kinematical signature and argue that UMi's clumpiness could indeed be a primordial artefact. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that substructure is incompatible with the cusped dark matter halos predicted by the prevailing cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm but is consistent with an unbound stellar cluster sloshing back and forth within the nearly harmonic potential of a cored dark matter halo. Thus, CDM appears to disagree with observation at the least massive, most dark matter-dominated end of the galaxy mass spectrum.},

  abstract = {We describe an algorithm for constructing N-body realizations of equilibrium spherical systems. A general form for the mass density {$\rho$}(r) is used, making it possible to represent most of the popular density profiles found in the literature, including the cuspy density profiles found in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We demonstrate explicitly that our models are in equilibrium. In contrast, many existing N-body realizations of isolated systems have been constructed under the assumption that the local velocity distribution is Maxwellian. We show that a Maxwellian halo with an initial {$\rho$}(r){\textasciitilde}r-1 central density cusp immediately develops a constant-density core. Moreover, after just one crossing time the orbital anisotropy has changed over the entire system, and the initially isotropic model becomes radially anisotropic. These effects have important implications for many studies, including the survival of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Comparing the evolution and mass-loss rate of isotropic Maxwellian and self-consistent Navarro, Frenk, \& White (NFW), satellites orbiting inside a static host CDM potential, we find that the former are unrealistically susceptible to tidal disruption. Thus, recent studies of the mass-loss rate and disruption timescales of substructure in CDM models may be compromised by using the Maxwellian approximation. We also demonstrate that a radially anisotropic, self-consistent NFW satellite loses mass at a rate several times higher than that of its isotropic counterpart on the same external tidal field and orbit.},

  abstract = {Draco and Ursa Minor both have published velocity dispersions of {\textasciitilde}10 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} implying large amounts of dark matter. Previous assumptions that the dark matter distribution followed the light led to central densities 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than in other dwarf galaxies. I construct models where the stellar distribution function is isothermal and use star counts to constrain the mass distribution. Even with these different assumptions, the dark matter densities are high. For a constant density halo, the best fit values are {$\rho$} {\textasciitilde}0.2 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum} and the lower limits are D {$\rho>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}. Draco is poorly fitted with a uniform density halo, but good fits are obtained using a dark matter distribution with a core radius. In this model, the apparent cut-off radius has nothing to do with galactic tides. For comparison, King's empirical formula was refitted. The derived tidal radii, r\_t\_, are only lower limits, r\_t.D\_ {$>$} 25 arcmin and r\_t.UM\_ {$>$} 35 arcmin. If the dark matter follows the light, then {$\rho\_$}0.D\_ {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.4 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum} and {$\rho\_$}0.UM\_ {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 0.2 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}. Both have M/L\_V\_ {$>$} 25 M\_sun\_/L\_sun\_. In all the models, the central column density of dark matter is as large as that of bright galaxies, i.e. 100-300M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-2{\textasciicircum}. Since the central surface brightnesses are low, Ursa Minor and Draco are excellent targets for dark matter searches.},

  abstract = {P-splines are an attractive approach for modeling nonlinear smooth effects of covariates within the additive and varying coefficient models framework. In this article, we first develop a Bayesian version for P-splines and generalize in a second step the approach in various ways. First, the assumption of constant smoothing parameters can be replaced by allowing the smoothing parameters to be locally adaptive. This is particularly useful in situations with changing curvature of the underlying smooth function or with highly oscillating functions. In a second extension, one-dimensional P-splines are generalized to two-dimensional surface fitting for modeling interactions between metrical covariates. In a last step, the approach is extended to situations with spatially correlated responses allowing the estimation of geoadditive models. Inference is fully Bayesian and uses recent MCMC techniques for drawing random samples from the posterior. In a couple of simulation studies the performance of Bayesian P-splines is studied and compared to other approaches in the literature. We illustrate the approach by two complex application on rents for flats in Munich and on human brain mapping.},

  abstract = {Observing the first generation of stars, Population III (Pop III), is still a challenge even with the JWST due to their faintness. Instead, searching for fossil records of Pop III stars in nearby dwarf galaxies provides an alternative method for studying their physical properties. It is intriguing that a star recently discovered in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy, named AS0039, is considered to show the unique signature of a Pop III star. The detailed abundance patterns of AS0039 are well matched with those predicted by nucleosynthesis models for Pop III exploding as an energetic hypernova (HN), confirming its potential to provide insight into the properties of the first stars. This study aims to explore the environmental conditions required for the formation of such a unique star using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations on dwarf galaxies with a mass of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}8\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ at z = 0 while varying the fraction of Pop III stars that undergo HNe. Our simulations identify rapid gas inflow (\${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}{\textbackslash}sim 0.08\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) as a possible factor in facilitating the formation of stars similar to AS0039. Alternatively, the delayed formation of subsequent Population II (Pop II) stars in the gas-enriched environment may lead to low-metallicity stars like AS0039. Additionally, using the A-SLOTH code, we investigate the probability of finding remnants of Pop II stars with HN signatures in nearby dwarf satellite galaxies. We suggest that the most likely dwarf galaxies to contain HN signatures are massive satellites with a probability of 40 per cent in the range of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ to\} {\textbackslash} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast \}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}7 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ to\} {\textbackslash} 10{\textasciicircum}8\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, considering observational limitations.},

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these resultsperformed within the astrometry task. Methods: Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G {$<$} 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr-1, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr-1. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr-1 in proper motion are seen on small ({$<$} 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) contains results for 1.812 billion sources in the magnitude range G = 3-21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase. Aims: We describe the input data, the models, and the processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia EDR3, as well as the validation of these results performed within the astrometry task. Methods: The processing broadly followed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements to the modelling of observations. For the first time in the Gaia data processing, colour-dependent calibrations of the line- and point-spread functions have been used for sources with well-determined colours from DR2. In the astrometric processing these sources obtained five-parameter solutions, whereas other sources were processed using a special calibration that allowed a pseudocolour to be estimated as the sixth astrometric parameter. Compared with DR2, the astrometric calibration models have been extended, and the spin-related distortion model includes a self-consistent determination of basic-angle variations, improving the global parallax zero point. Results: Gaia EDR3 gives full astrometric data (positions at epoch J2016.0, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1.468 billion sources (585 millionwith five-parameter solutions, 882 million with six parameters), and mean positions at J2016.0 for an additional 344 million.Solutions with five parameters are generally more accurate than six-parameter solutions, and are available for 93\% of the sources brighter than the 17th magnitude. The median uncertainty in parallax and annual proper motion is 0.02-0.03 mas at magnitude G = 9-14, and around 0.5 mas at G = 20. Extensive characterisation of the statistical properties of the solutions is provided, including the estimated angular power spectrum of parallax bias from the quasars.},

We model the cleaned data sets by adjusting the solutions of the Jeans equations to the profiles of the projected velocity dispersion and kurtosis. The data are well reproduced by models where mass follows light and the best-fitting stellar orbits are isotropic to weakly tangential, as expected from the tidal stirring scenario. The Fornax dwarf, with more than 2400 member stars, is a dSph galaxy with the most accurately determined mass to date: its 1{$\sigma$} error following from the sampling errors of the velocity moments is below 5 per cent. With mass-to-light ratio of 97 solar units, Sextans seems to be the most dark matter dominated of the four dSph galaxies.},

  abstract = {The well-established correlations between the mass of massive black holes (BHs) in the nuclei of most studied galaxies and various global properties of their hosting galaxy lend support to the idea that dwarf galaxies and globular clusters could also host a BH in their centers. Direct kinematic detection of BHs in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies is seriously hindered by the small number of stars inside the gravitational influence region of the BH. The aim of this Letter is to establish an upper dynamical limit on the mass of the putative BH in the Ursa Minor (UMi) dSph galaxy. We present direct N-body simulations of the tidal disruption of the dynamical fossil observed in UMi, with and without a massive BH. We find that the observed substructure is incompatible with the presence of a massive BH of (2-3) {\texttimes} 104 M sun within the core of UMi. These limits are consistent with the extrapolation of the M BH-{$\sigma$} relation to the M BH {$<$} 106 M sun regime. We also show that the BH may be off-center with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy.},

  abstract = {We use a suite of cosmological simulations to study the mass--concentration--redshift relation, c(M, z), of dark matter haloes. Our simulations include standard {$\Lambda$}-cold dark matter (CDM) models, and additional runs with truncated power spectra, consistent with a thermal warm dark matter (WDM) scenario. We find that the mass profiles of CDM and WDM haloes are self-similar and well approximated by the Einasto profile. The c(M, z) relation of CDM haloes is monotonic: concentrations decrease with increasing virial mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift at fixed mass. The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM haloes are also scale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do not apply to WDM haloes: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the characteristic scale imposed by the power spectrum suppression. Further, the WDM c(M, z) relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass scale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower masses. We show that the assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer its concentration, provided that the total mass of its progenitors is considered (the `collapsed mass history'; CMH), rather than just that of its main ancestor. This exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to derive a simple scaling that reproduces the mass--concentration--redshift relation of both CDM and WDM haloes over a vast range of halo masses and redshifts. Our model therefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift, cosmology and power spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations.},

Four farther distant globulars of concentration class XII appear to be unrelated. Using the known distances to the optical objects, the parallaxes due to the offset of the Sun from galactic centre are calculated. Not only the Magellanic stream, but also Sculptor and the Draco-Ursa Minor stream are then seen to lie in a plane which is presumably the plane of the orbit of the Magellanic Clouds about the galactic centre. By demanding that all points of the Magellanic stream be precisely in the plane defined by the galactic centre Palomar 13 and the centre of the mass of the Magellanic Clouds, the distances to all points of the stream are calculated from parallax. With both radial velocities and distances known to so many points on the stream, it seems likely that dynamical modelling will yield a much more accurate total mass for the Galaxy.},

The V-band surface brightness for this possible tidal extension ranges from 29.8 to 31.5 mag arcsec-2. The area covered in our survey ({\textasciitilde}1.65 deg2) is not enough to discriminate if this extratidal population is part of a tidal tail or an extended halo around the galaxy. The existence of this tidal extension in Ursa Minor indicates that this satellite is currently undergoing a tidal disruption process by the Milky Way.

We combine proper motions (PMs) from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and line-of-sight velocities (vlos) from the literature to derive their 3D internal kinematics and to study the presence of internal velocity gradients. We find velocity gradients along the line-of-sight for Carina, Draco, Fornax, and Ursa Minor, at {$\geq$}1{$\sigma$} level of significance. The value of such gradients appears to be related to the orbital history of the dwarfs, indicating that the interaction with the MW is causing them. Dwarfs that are close to the MW and moving towards their orbits pericentres show, on average, larger velocity gradients. On the other hand, dwarfs that have recently left their orbits pericentres show no significant gradients. Lastly, dwarfs located at large Galactocentric distances show gradients with an intermediate intensity. Our results would indicate that the torque caused by the strong tidal forces exerted by the MW induces a strong velocity gradient when the dwarfs approach their orbits pericentres. During the pericentre passage, the rapid change in the forces direction would disrupt such gradient, which may steadily recover as the galaxies recede. We assess our findings by analysing dwarfs satellites from the TNG50 simulation. We find a significant increase in the intensity of the detected gradients as the satellites approach their pericentre, followed by a sharp drop as they abandon it, supporting our results for the dSphs of the MW.},

The RRLs display a spread in V-magnitude ({$\sim$}0.35 mag) which appears larger than photometric errors and the horizontal branch (HB) luminosity evolution of a mono-metallic population. Using several calibrations of two different reddening free and metal independent period-Wesenheit relations we provide a new distance estimate {$\mu$} = 19.62 mag ({$\sigma\mu$} = 0.04 mag) that agrees well with literature estimates. We constrained the metallicity distribution of the old population, using the MI period-luminosity relation, and we found that it ranges from -2.3 to -1.5 dex. The current estimate is narrower than suggested by low and intermediate spectroscopy of RGBs ({$\Delta$} [Fe/H]{$\leq$} 1.5). We also investigated the HB morphology as a function of the galactocentric distance. The HB in the innermost regions is dominated by red HB stars and by RRLs, consistent with a more metal-rich population, while in the outermost regions it is dominated by blue HB stars and RRLs typical of a metal-poor population. Our results suggest that fast chemical evolution occurred in Sculptor, and that the radial gradients were in place at an early epoch.},

Even for the dwarf galaxy Sculptor---one of the best-studied systems, which is inferred to be strongly dark matter dominated3,4---there are conflicting reports5-7 on its mean motion around the Milky Way, and the three-dimensional internal motions of its stars have never been measured. Here, we present precise proper motions of Sculptor's stars based on data from the Gaia mission8 and Hubble Space Telescope. Our measurements show that Sculptor moves around the Milky Way on a high-inclination elongated orbit that takes it much further out than previously thought. For Sculptor's internal velocity dispersions, we find {$\sigma$}R = 11.5 {\textpm} 4.3 km s-1 and {$\sigma$}T = 8.5 {\textpm} 3.2 km s-1 along the projected radial and tangential directions. Thus, the stars in our sample move preferentially on radial orbits as quantified by the anisotropy parameter, which we find to be {$\beta$} 0.8 6-0.83+0.12 at a location beyond the core radius. Taken at face value, this high radial anisotropy requires abandoning conventional models9 for Sculptor's mass distribution. Our sample is dominated by metal-rich stars and for these we find {$\beta$}M R 0.9 5-0.27+0.04---a value consistent with multi-component spherical models where Sculptor is embedded in a cuspy dark halo10, as might be expected for cold dark matter.},

We demonstrate that the stars and star clusters that form naturally in the inner regions of dwarfs are expected to migrate from the gas-rich, star-forming center to join the stellar spheroid. For dwarf galaxies, this process could be the dominant source of halo stars. The effect is caused by stellar-feedback-driven bulk motions of dense gas which, by causing potential fluctuations in the inner regions of the halo, couple to all collisionless components. This effect has been demonstrated to generate cores in otherwise cuspy cold dark matter profiles and is particularly effective in dwarf galaxy halos. It can build a stellar spheroid with larger ages and lower metallicities at greater radii without requiring an outside-in formation model. Globular-cluster-type star clusters can be created in the galactic ISM and then migrate to the spheroid on 100 Myr timescales. Once outside the inner regions, they are less susceptible to tidal disruption and are thus long lived; clusters on wider orbits may be easily unbound from the dwarf to join the halo of a larger galaxy during a merger. A simulated dwarf galaxy (Mvir {$\simeq$} 109 M{$\Sun$} at z = 5) is used to examine this gravitational coupling to dark matter and stars.},

  abstract = {We present results from high-resolution N-body/SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamic) simulations of rotationally supported dwarf irregular galaxies moving on bound orbits in the massive dark matter halo of the Milky Way. The dwarf models span a range in disk surface density and the masses and sizes of their dark halos are consistent with the predictions of cold dark matter cosmogonies. We show that the strong tidal field of the Milky Way determines severe mass loss in their halos and disks and induces bar and bending instabilities that transform low surface brightness dwarfs (LSBs) into dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and high surface brightness dwarfs (HSBs) into dwarf ellipticals (dEs) in less than 10 Gyr. The final central velocity dispersions of the remnants are in the range 8-30 km s-1 and their final v/{$\sigma$} falls to values less than 0.5, matching well the kinematics of early-type dwarfs. The transformation requires the orbital time of the dwarf to be {$<$}{\textasciitilde}3-4 Gyr, which implies a halo as massive and extended as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation to explain the origin of even the farthest dSph satellites of the Milky Way, Leo I, and Leo II. We show that only dwarfs with central dark matter densities as high as those of Draco and Ursa Minor can survive for 10 Gyr in the proximity of the Milky Way. A correlation between the central density and the distance of the dwarfs from the primary galaxy is indeed expected in hierarchical models, in which the densest objects should have small orbital times because of their early formation epochs. Part of the gas is stripped and part is funneled to the center because of the bar, generating one strong burst of star formation in HSBs and smaller, multiple bursts in LSBs. Therefore, the large variety of star formation histories observed in Local Group dSphs arises because different types of dIrr progenitors respond differently to the external perturbation of the Milky Way. Our evolutionary model naturally explains the morphology-density relation observed in the Local Group and in other nearby loose groups. Extended low surface brightness stellar and gaseous streams originate from LSBs and follow the orbit of the dwarfs for several gigayears. Because of their high velocities, unbound stars projected along the line of sight can lead to overestimating the mass-to-light ratio of the bound remnant by a factor {$<$}{\textasciitilde}2, but this does not eliminate the need of extremely high dark matter contents in some of the dSphs.},

Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates reliably placing them within 3 Mpc of the Sun are identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible "floor" in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered.},

  abstract = {We present mass models of the Milky Way created to fit observational constraints and to be consistent with expectations from theoretical modelling. The method used to create these models is that demonstrated in our previous study, and we improve on those models by adding gas discs to the potential, considering the effects of allowing the inner slope of the halo density profile to vary, and including new observations of maser sources in the Milky Way amongst the new constraints. We provide a best-fitting model, as well as estimates of the properties of the Milky Way. Under the assumptions in our main model, we find that the Sun is R0 = 8.20 {\textpm} 0.09 kpc from the Galactic Centre, with the circular speed at the Sun being v0 = 232.8 {\textpm} 3.0 km s-1; and that the Galaxy has a total stellar mass of (54.3 {\textpm} 5.7) {\texttimes} 109 M{$\odot$}, a total virial mass of (1.30 {\textpm} 0.30) {\texttimes} 1012 M{$\odot$} and a local dark-matter density of 0.40 {\textpm} 0.04 GeV cm-3, where the quoted uncertainties are statistical. These values are sensitive to our choice of priors and constraints. We investigate systematic uncertainties, which in some cases may be larger. For example, if we weaken our prior on R0, we find it to be 7.97 {\textpm} 0.15 kpc and that v0 = 226.8 {\textpm} 4.2 km s-1. We find that most of these properties, including the local dark-matter density, are remarkably insensitive to the assumed power-law density slope at the centre of the dark-matter halo. We find that it is unlikely that the local standard of rest differs significantly from that found under assumptions of axisymmetry. We have made code to compute the force from our potential, and to integrate orbits within it, publicly available.},

This is the largest and most uniform analysis of Milky Way satellites undertaken to date and represents roughly three-quarters (58/81 {$\simeq$} 72\%) of all known outer halo satellites. We use a maximum-likelihood method to fit four density laws to each object in our survey: exponential, Plummer, King, and S{\'e}rsic models. We systematically examine the isodensity contour maps and color-magnitude diagrams for each of our program objects, present a comparison with previous results, and tabulate our best-fit photometric and structural parameters, including ellipticities, position angles, effective radii, S{\'e}rsic indices, absolute magnitudes, and surface brightness measurements. We investigate the distribution of outer halo satellites in the size-magnitude diagram and show that the current sample of outer halo substructures spans a wide range in effective radius, luminosity, and surface brightness, with little evidence for a clean separation into star cluster and galaxy populations at the faintest luminosities and surface brightnesses.},

Our sample consists of 58 stellar overdensities---i.e., substructures classified as either globular clusters, classical dwarf galaxies, or ultra-faint dwarf galaxies---that are located at Galactocentric distances of R GC {$\geq$} 25 kpc (outer halo) and out to {$\sim$}400 kpc. This includes 44 objects for which we have acquired deep, wide-field, g- and r-band imaging with the MegaCam mosaic cameras on the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the 6.5 m Magellan-Clay telescope. These data are supplemented by archival imaging, or published gr photometry, for an additional 14 objects, most of which were discovered recently in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We describe the scientific motivation for our survey, including sample selection, observing strategy, data reduction pipeline, calibration procedures, and the depth and precision of the photometry. The typical 5{$\sigma$} point-source limiting magnitudes for our MegaCam imaging---which collectively covers an area of {$\approx$}52 deg2---are g lim {$\simeq$} 25.6 and r lim {$\simeq$} 25.3 AB mag. These limits are comparable to those from the coadded DES images and are roughly a half-magnitude deeper than will be reached in a single visit with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Our photometric catalog thus provides the deepest and most uniform photometric database of Milky Way satellites available for the foreseeable future. In other papers in this series, we have used these data to explore the blue straggler populations in these objects, their density distributions, star formation histories, scaling relations, and possible foreground structures.},

This constitutes all known Milky Way dwarf galaxies (and likely candidates) as of 2020 May, except for the Magellanic Clouds, the Canis Major and Hydra 1 stellar overdensities, and the tidally disrupting Bootes III and Sagittarius dwarf galaxies. We derive systemic proper motions for the first time for Indus 1, DES J0225+0304, Cetus 2, Pictor 2, and Leo T, but note that the latter three rely on photometry that is of poorer quality than that of the rest of the sample. We cannot resolve a signal for Bootes 4, Cetus 3, Indus 2, Pegasus 3, or Virgo 1. Our method is inspired by the maximum likelihood approach of Pace \& Li and examines simultaneously the spatial, color-magnitude, and proper motion distribution of sources. Systemic proper motions are derived without the need to identify confirmed radial velocity members, although the proper motions of these stars, where available, are incorporated into the analysis through a prior on the model. The associated uncertainties on the systemic proper motions are on average a factor of {$\sim$}1.4 smaller than existing literature values. Analysis of the implied membership distribution of the satellites suggests that we accurately identify member stars with a contamination rate lower than 1 in 20.},

  abstract = {We study the mass, velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) haloes using a suite of N-body simulations of unprecedented numerical resolution. The Aquarius Project follows the formation of six different galaxy-sized haloes simulated several times at varying numerical resolution, allowing numerical convergence to be assessed directly. The highest resolution simulation represents a single dark matter halo using 4.4 billion particles, of which 1.1 billion end up within the virial radius. Our analysis confirms a number of results claimed by earlier work, and clarifies a few issues where conflicting claims may be found in the recent literature. The mass profile of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes deviates slightly but systematically from the form proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White. The spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower inwards and, at the innermost resolved radius, the logarithmic slope is {$\gamma$} {$\equiv$} - d ln {$\rho$}/d ln r {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 1. Asymptotic inner slopes as steep as the recently claimed {$\rho$} {\textasciitilde} r-1.2 are clearly ruled out. The radial dependence of {$\gamma$} is well approximated by a power law, {$\gamma$} {\textasciitilde} r{$\alpha$} (the Einasto profile). The shape parameter, {$\alpha$}, varies slightly but significantly from halo to halo, implying that the mass profiles of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes are not strictly universal: different haloes cannot, in general, be rescaled to look identical. Departures from similarity are also seen in velocity dispersion profiles and correlate with those in density profiles so as to preserve a power-law form for the spherically averaged pseudo-phase-space density, {$\rho$}/{$\sigma$}3 {\textasciitilde} r-1.875. The index here is identical to that of Bertschinger's similarity solution for self-similar infall on to a point mass from an otherwise uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe. The origin of this striking behaviour is unclear, but its robustness suggests that it reflects a fundamental structural property of {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes. Our conclusions are reliable down to radii below 0.4 per cent of the virial radius, providing well-defined predictions for halo structure when baryonic effects are neglected, and thus an instructive theoretical template against which the modifications induced by the baryonic components of real galaxies can be judged.},

We adopt an axisymmetric approximation and use an updated Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method, which allows for a generic shape and radial orientation of the velocity ellipsoid, as indicated by the Gaia data, to fit the mean velocities and all three components of the intrinsic velocity dispersion tensor. The Milky Way is the first galaxy for which all intrinsic phase space coordinates are available, and the kinematics are superior to the best integral-field kinematics of external galaxies. This situation removes the long-standing dynamical degeneracies and makes this the first dynamical model highly overconstrained by the kinematics. For these reasons, our ability to fit the data provides a fundamental test for both galaxy dynamics and the mass distribution in the Milky Way disc. We tightly constrain the volume average total density logarithmic slope, in the radial range 3.6-12 kpc, to be {$\alpha$}tot = -2.149 {\textpm} 0.055 and find that the dark halo slope must be significantly steeper than {$\alpha$}DM = -1 (NFW).

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

  abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

The deep (g {$\sim$} 24) SMASH color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) clearly reveal old ({$\sim$}9 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] {$\approx$} -0.8 dex) main-sequence stars at a distance of {$\sim$}50 kpc. The surface brightness of these detections is extremely low with our most distant detection at {$\Sigma$} g {$\approx$} 34 mag arcsec-2. The SMASH radial density profile breaks from the inner LMC exponential decline at {$\sim$}13{$^\circ$}-15{$^\circ$} and a second component at larger radii has a shallower slope with power-law index {$\alpha$} = -2.2 that contributes {$\sim$}0.4\% of the LMC's total stellar mass. In addition, the SMASH densities exhibit large scatter around our best-fit model of {$\sim$}70\% indicating that the envelope of stellar material in the LMC periphery is highly disturbed. We also use data from the NOAO Source catalog to map the LMC main-sequence populations at intermediate radii and detect a steep dropoff in density on the eastern side of the LMC (at R {$\approx$} 8{$^\circ$}) as well as an extended structure to the far northeast. These combined results confirm the existence of a very extended, low-density envelope of stellar material with a disturbed shape around the LMC. The exact origin of this structure remains unclear, but the leading options include an accreted halo or tidally stripped outer disk material.},

We make use of the spherically aligned Jeans anisotropic method to model the stellar velocities and their velocity dispersions. Building upon our previous work, our model is now fitted to kinematic maps that have been extended to larger galactocentric radii due to the expansion of our data set, probing the outer regions of the Galactic disk. Our best-fitting dynamical model suggests a logarithmic density slope of {$\alpha$}DM = -1.602 {\textpm} 0.079syst for the dark matter halo and a dark matter density of {$\rho$}DM(R{$\odot$}) = (8.92 {\textpm} 0.56syst) {\texttimes} 10-3 M{$\odot$} pc-3 (0.339 {\textpm} 0.022syst GeV cm3). We estimate a circular velocity at the solar radius of vcirc = (234.7 {\textpm} 1.7syst) km s-1 with a decline toward larger radii. The total mass density is {$\rho$}tot(R{$\odot$}) = (0.0672 {\textpm} 0.0015syst) M{$\odot$} pc-3 with a slope of {$\alpha$}tot = -2.367 {\textpm} 0.047syst for 5 kpc {$\leq$} R {$\leq$} 19.5 kpc, and the total surface density is {$\Sigma$}(R{$\odot$}, {$\mid$}z{$\mid$} {$\leq$} 1.1 kpc) = (55.5 {\textpm} 1.7syst) M{$\odot$} pc-2. While the statistical errors are small, the error budget of the derived quantities is dominated by the three to seven times larger systematic uncertainties. These values are consistent with our previous determination, but the systematic uncertainties are reduced due to the extended data set covering a larger spatial extent of the Milky Way disk. Furthermore, we test the influence of nonaxisymmetric features on our resulting model and analyze how a flaring disk model would change our findings.},

  abstract = {We present high-resolution rotation curves and mass models of 26 dwarf galaxies from ``Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The H i Nearby Galaxy Survey'' (LITTLE THINGS). LITTLE THINGS is a high-resolution ({$\sim$}6{${''}$} angular; {$<$}2.6 km s-1 velocity resolution) Very Large Array H i survey for nearby dwarf galaxies in the local volume within 11 Mpc. The high-resolution H i observations enable us to derive reliable rotation curves of the sample galaxies in a homogeneous and consistent manner. The rotation curves are then combined with Spitzer archival 3.6 {$\mu$}m and ancillary optical U, B, and V images to construct mass models of the galaxies. This high quality multi-wavelength data set significantly reduces observational uncertainties and thus allows us to examine the mass distribution in the galaxies in detail. We decompose the rotation curves in terms of the dynamical contributions by baryons and dark matter (DM) halos, and compare the latter with those of dwarf galaxies from THINGS as well as {$\Lambda$}CDM Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations in which the effect of baryonic feedback processes is included. Being generally consistent with THINGS and simulated dwarf galaxies, most of the LITTLE THINGS sample galaxies show a linear increase of the rotation curve in their inner regions, which gives shallower logarithmic inner slopes {$\alpha$} of their DM density profiles. The mean value of the slopes of the 26 LITTLE THINGS dwarf galaxies is {$\alpha$} =-0.32+/- 0.24 which is in accordance with the previous results found for low surface brightness galaxies ({$\alpha$} =-0.2+/- 0.2) as well as the seven THINGS dwarf galaxies ({$\alpha$} =-0.29+/- 0.07). However, this significantly deviates from the cusp-like DM distribution predicted by DM-only {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations. Instead our results are more in line with the shallower slopes found in the {$\Lambda$}CDM SPH simulations of dwarf galaxies in which the effect of baryonic feedback processes is included. In addition, we discuss the central DM distribution of DDO 210 whose stellar mass is relatively low in our sample to examine the scenario of inefficient supernova feedback in low mass dwarf galaxies predicted from recent {$\Lambda$}CDM SPH simulations of dwarf galaxies where central cusps still remain.},

Of the 118 stars in our sample with multiple observations, six are velocity variables with X{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum} probabilities below 0.001. We use Monte Carlo simulations that mimic our observations to determine the efficiency with which our observations find binary stars. Our best, though significantly uncertain, estimate of the binary frequency for stars near the turnoff in Draco and UMi is 0.2-0.3 per decade of period in the vicinity of periods of one year, which is 3-5X that found for the solar neighborhood. This frequency is high enough that binary stars might significantly affect the measured velocity dispersions of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies according to some previous numerical experiments. However, in the course of performing our own experiments, we discovered that this previous work had inadvertently overestimated binary orbital velocities. Our first set of simulations of the effects of binaries is based on the observed scatter in the individual velocity measurements for the multiply-observed Draco and Ursa Minor stars. This scatter is small compared to measured velocity dispersions and, so, the effect of binaries on the dispersions is slight. This result is supported by our second set of experiments, which are based on a model binary population normalized by the observed binary frequency in Draco and Ursa Minor. We conclude that binary stars have had no significant effect on the measured velocity dispersion and inferred mass-to-light ratio of any dwarf spheroidal galaxy.},

The kinematically cold object has been found before using a smaller data set, but the prediction that this cold object has a velocity dispersion larger than 2.0 km s-1 at 95 per cent confidence level differs from previous work. We use two- and three-component models along with the information criteria and Bayesian evidence model selection methods to argue that Ursa Minor has additional localized secondary populations. The significant probability for a large velocity dispersion in each secondary object raises the intriguing possibility that each has its own dark matter halo, that is, it is a satellite of a satellite of the Milky Way.},

We identify 892 likely members, making this the largest UMi sample with line-of-sight velocity and metallicity measurements. Our Bayesian method detects two distinct chemodynamic populations with high significance (in logarithmic Bayes factor, ln B {\textasciitilde} 33). The metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -2.05 {\textpm} 0.03) population is kinematically colder (radial velocity dispersion of \${\textbackslash}sigma \_v=4.9\_\{-1.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.8\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) and more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor (\$[\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe/H\}]=-2.29\_\{-0.06\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\$) and kinematically hotter population (\${\textbackslash}sigma \_v =11.5\_\{-0.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.9\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). Furthermore, we apply the same analysis to an independent Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT)/Hectochelle data set and confirm the existence of two chemodynamic populations in UMi. In both data sets, the metal-rich population is significantly flattened ({$\epsilon$} = 0.75 {\textpm} 0.03) and the metal-poor population is closer to spherical (\${\textbackslash}epsilon =0.33\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$). Despite the presence of two populations, we are able to robustly estimate the slope of the dynamical mass profile. We found hints for prolate rotation of order \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}2 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ in the MMT data set, but further observations are required to verify this. The flattened metal-rich population invalidates assumptions built into simple dynamical mass estimators, so we computed new astrophysical dark matter annihilation (J) and decay profiles based on the rounder, hotter metal-poor population and inferred \${\textbackslash}log \_\{10\}\{(J(0\{{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\_\{.\}\}5)/\{{\textbackslash}rm GeV{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}, cm{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\})\}{\textbackslash}approx 19.1\$ for the Keck data set.

For these orbits, we use a Monte Carlo sample for the observational uncertainties for each dSph and the uncertainties in the MW and LMC potentials. We predict that Ant II, Boo III, Cra II, Gru II, and Tuc III should be tidally disrupting by comparing each dSph's average density relative to the MW density at its pericenter. dSphs with large ellipticity (CVn I, Her, Tuc V, UMa I, UMa II, UMi, Wil 1) show a preference for their orbital direction to align with their major axis even for dSphs with large pericenters. We compare the dSph radial orbital phase to subhalos in MW-like N-body simulations and infer that there is not an excess of satellites near their pericenter. With projections of future Gaia data releases, we find that dSph's orbital precision will be limited by uncertainties in the distance and/or MW potential rather than in proper motion precision.

We utilize the superb photometry from the first public data release (DR1) of the DES to select candidate members and cross-match them with the proper motions from the Gaia DR2. We model the candidate members with a mixture model (satellite and MW) in spatial and proper motion space. This method does not require prior knowledge of satellite membership and can successfully determine the tangential motion of 13 DES satellites. With our method, we present measurements of the following satellites: Columba I, Eridanus III, Grus II, Phoenix II, Pictor I, Reticulum III, and Tucana IV. This is the first systemic proper motion measurement for several of these satellites, and the majority lack extensive spectroscopic follow-up studies. We compare these to the predictions of Large Magellanic Cloud satellites and the vast polar structure. With the high-precision DES photometry, we conclude that most of the newly identified member stars are very metal-poor ([Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -2), similar to other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, while Reticulum III is likely more metal-rich. We also find potential members in the following satellites that might indicate their overall proper motion: Cetus II, Kim 2, and Horologium II.

  abstract = {The Lambda cold dark matter (DM) model successfully explains the distribution of large scale structure and the cosmic microwave background but, there are several problems concerning the distribution of DM on sub-galactic scales. Robust measurements of the distribution of DM in low mass dwarf galaxies are key to understand the true nature of DM. In this work, we present two new techniques for characterizing the kinematics of dispersion supported systems. The first method identifies localized kinematic substructure in line-of-sight velocity data while the second separates global stellar populations utilizing metallicty, line-of-sight velocity, and spatial information. We apply the first method to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor and find two localized kinematic substructures at high significance. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of Ursa Minor, motivated by the previous detection, which form the largest spectroscopic data set of Ursa Minor. With the new data, we identify two chemodynamical stellar population at high significance with distinct kinematic, metallicity, and spatial distributions. By utilizing the dynamics of multiple stellar populations we break halo profile degeneracies and find the DM slope is more consistent with a 'cored' halo than a 'cuspy' halo. We present a complementary study comparing a large sample of literature rotation curves to dark matter halos influenced by baryonic processes. The analysis suggests that baryonic processes are an inconsistent solution to the 'core-cusp' problem.},

The next decade will be an exciting era for near-field cosmology with many upcoming surveys and facilities, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Euclid mission, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that will both discover new dwarf galaxies and star clusters in the Local Volume and characterize known dwarf galaxies and star clusters in more detail than ever before. The LVDB will be continually updated and is built to support and enable future dwarf galaxy and star cluster research in this data-rich era. The LVDB catalogs and package are publicly available as a GitHub repository, \${\textbackslash}texttt\{local\_volume\_database\}\$, and community use and contributions via GitHub are encouraged.},

  abstract = {This thesis provides evidence that the outer halo of the Milky Way Galaxy has in the past, and continues presently, to accumulate stars and stellar systems from satellite galaxies. The results of three experiments support this conclusion: We search the distribution of possible orbital poles of all Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters for co-orbiting objects, an expected signature for the products of tidal disruption. The principal results are: (1)It is statistically more likely that outer halo (Rgc {$>$} 8 kpc) ``red horizontal branch'' globular clusters share orbits similar to the dwarf satellite galaxies than do outer halo ``blue horizontal branch/metal-poor'' globular clusters. (2)The most distant, outer halo globular clusters (Rgc {$>$} 25 kpc) Pal 4, NGC 6229, NGC 7006, and Pyxis are most likely to share an orbit with the Galactic satellite galaxies. A more complete, dynamical analysis of those globular clusters and satellite galaxies with known space motions finds little evidence for common orbits among the 41 clusters and any of the 6 satellite galaxies. This is to be expected, however, since the majority of the 41 globular clusters are inner halo (Rgc {$<$} 8 kpc), blue horizontal branch/metal-poor or disk clusters. Motivated by the study above, a first measurement of the radial velocity of the Pyxis globular cluster is presented, and reveals that it can only share the orbital pole of the Magellanic Clouds (an association predicted by the orbital pole analysis) if it is on an eccentric orbit ({$\varepsilon$} {$>$} 0.7). However, the few outer halo clusters with known orbits are found on very eccentric orbits. An analysis of the Ursa Minor dwarf galaxy reveals a large population of stars outside its nominal tidal radius. These stars, if unbound to Ursa Minor, suggest that the galaxy is losing up to a third of its mass per Gyr to the Milky Way, a conclusion that supports the overall premise of this thesis, that the Galaxy is growing from the accretion of satellite galaxies. The morphology of this satellite galaxy is peculiar even within its tidal radius, which further suggests an ongoing interaction with the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {All stellar evolution models require an initial isotopic abundance set as input, but these abundances are well known only for the Sun. Yet, input compositions can be estimated by scaling solar abundances using a previously constructed isotopic history model based on astrophysical processes in the Galaxy. This method, however, may not work for obtaining inputs for compositions that have distinct chemical histories from the Galaxy. We thus present a partial isotopic history model for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy based on astrophysical processes, which can be used to estimate input isotopic abundances in future nucleosynthesis studies. The model is fitted to observational data, and follows the methodology of the previously constructed isotopic history model for the Galaxy. First, we estimate the isotopic composition of Sculptor's late-stage evolution (LSE) using the OMEGA chemical evolution code, and then decompose that composition into contributions from various astrophysical sources. Each contribution is then assumed to scale as a function of metallicity. The isotopic abundances are summed into elemental abundances and fit to available observational elemental abundance data to tune the model's free parameters. The result is an average isotopic history model of Sculptor for massive star, Type Ia SNe, s-process, and r-process contributions that uses elemental data to constrain the isotopic abundances. As an example, our model finds that Type Ia SNe contribute {$\approx$} 87 percent to the LSE Fe abundance, and neutron star mergers contribute {$\approx$} 36 percent to the LSE Eu abundance, in agreement with previous studies.},

  abstract = {With the release of Gaia DR2, it is now possible to measure the proper motions (PMs) of the lowest-mass, ultrafaint satellite galaxies in the Milky Way's (MW) halo for the first time. Many of these faint satellites are posited to have been accreted as satellites of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). Using their six-dimensional phase-space information, we calculate the orbital histories of 13 ultrafaint satellites and five classical dwarf spheroidals in a combined MW+LMC+SMC potential to determine which galaxies are dynamically associated with the MCs. These 18 galaxies are separated into four classes: (I) long-term Magellanic satellites that have been bound to the MCs for at least the last two consecutive orbits around the MCs (Carina 2, Carina 3, Horologium 1, Hydrus 1); (II) Magellanic satellites that were recently captured by the MCs {$<$} 1 Gyr ago (Reticulum 2, Phoenix 2); (III) MW satellites that have interacted with the MCs (Sculptor 1, Tucana 3, Segue 1); and (IV) MW satellites (Aquarius 2, Canes Venatici 2, Crater 2, Draco 1, Draco 2, Hydra 2, Carina, Fornax, Ursa Minor). Results are reported for a range of MW and LMC masses. Contrary to previous work, we find no dynamical association between Carina, Fornax, and the MCs. Finally, we determine that the addition of the SMC's gravitational potential affects the longevity of satellites as members of the Magellanic system (long-term versus recently captured), but it does not change the total number of Magellanic satellites.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to explore the effects of tidal stripping on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically motivated initial conditions where dSphs are modeled as King spheres, embedded in Navarro-Frenk-White dark halos and orbiting the Galactic potential on eccentric orbits. As expected, systems that orbit through dense regions of the Galaxy lose a significant fraction of stars after each pericentric passage. These episodes of mass loss, however, do not impose a clear tidal cutoff on the bound stellar core. Rather, once equilibrium has been re-established the outer mass profile approaches a power law well described by a simple Plummer model. As noted in earlier work, tides also result in transient features in the outer density profile. As the system relaxes, an outward-moving "excess" of stars is found at radii where the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsed since pericenter. If the orbit of the dSph is known, these results provide a simple way to assess whether "breaks" and "bumps" in the outer profile of dSphs are actually tidal in origin. We apply this to the Sagittarius dwarf and, encouragingly, identify two features in the surface brightness profile that may be traced to its two last pericentric passages. Applied to Leo I, our results predict that any tidal break would occur at radii beyond those surveyed by current data, casting doubt on recent claims of the detection of tidal debris around this galaxy. For Carina, our model indicates that the tidal break should occur at a radius twice farther than observed. This suggests that the outer excess of stars in Carina is not tidal in origin unless its orbit is in error. A similar comment applies to Sculptor, whose pericenter appears too large for Galactic tides to be important but whose outer profile, like that of Draco, nonetheless follows closely a Plummer law. Fornax and Leo II show no sign of a power-law outer profile, suggesting that they have not been significantly affected by tides. Published profiles for other Milky Way dSph companions do not extend sufficiently far to allow for conclusive assessment. Panoramic surveys that extend surface brightness profiles beyond {\textasciitilde}10 core radii, together with improved constraints on the orbital parameters of dSphs, are needed in order to establish the true origin of the outer envelopes of stars surrounding dSphs.},

Motivated by this result, we apply a Bayesian technique devised by Pe{\~n}arrubia et~al. to simultaneously fit (i) distances and velocities of galaxies within 3~Mpc and (ii) the relative motion between the Milky Way and Andromeda derived from HST observations, with the LMC mass (MLMC) as a free parameter.

  abstract = {This article presents a measurement of the proper motion of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy determined from images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in two distinct fields. Each field contains a quasi-stellar object that serves as the ``reference point.'' The measured proper motion for Ursa Minor, expressed in the equatorial coordinate system, is ({$\mu\alpha$},{$\mu\delta$})=(-50+/-17,22+/-16) mas century-1. Removing the contributions of the solar motion and the motion of the local standard of rest yields the proper motion in the Galactic rest frame: ({$\mu$}Grf{$\alpha$},{$\mu$}Grf{$\delta$})=(-8+/-17,38+/-16) mas century-1. The implied space velocity with respect to the Galactic center has a radial component of Vr=-75+/-44 km s-1 and a tangential component of Vt=144+/-50 km s-1. Integrating the motion of Ursa Minor in a realistic potential for the Milky Way produces orbital elements. The perigalacticon and apogalacticon are 40 (10, 76) and 89 (78, 160) kpc, respectively, where the values in the parentheses represent the 95\% confidence intervals derived from Monte Carlo experiments. The eccentricity of the orbit is 0.39 (0.09, 0.79), and the orbital period is 1.5 (1.1, 2.7) Gyr. The orbit is retrograde and inclined by 124{$^\circ$} (94{$^\circ$}, 136{$^\circ$}) to the Galactic plane. Ursa Minor is not a likely member of a proposed stream of galaxies on similar orbits around the Milky Way, nor is the plane of its orbit coincident with a recently proposed planar alignment of galaxies around the Milky Way. Comparing the orbits of Ursa Minor and Carina shows no reason for the different star formation histories of these two galaxies. Ursa Minor must contain dark matter to have a high probability of having survived disruption by the Galactic tidal force until the present.

  abstract = {In the era of precision cosmology, it is essential to determine the Hubble constant empirically with an accuracy of one per cent or better1. At present, the uncertainty on this constant is dominated by the uncertainty in the calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity relationship2,3 (also known as the Leavitt law). The Large Magellanic Cloud has traditionally served as the best galaxy with which to calibrate Cepheid period-luminosity relations, and as a result has become the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale4,5. Eclipsing binary systems composed of late-type stars offer the most precise and accurate way to measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Currently the limit of the precision attainable with this technique is about two per cent, and is set by the precision of the existing calibrations of the surface brightness-colour relation5,6. Here we report a calibration of the surface brightness-colour relation with a precision of 0.8 per cent. We use this calibration to determine a geometrical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to 1 per cent based on 20 eclipsing binary systems. The final distance is 49.59 {\textpm} 0.09 (statistical) {\textpm} 0.54 (systematic) kiloparsecs.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5{$\sigma$} level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {$\Lambda$}CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density {\textohm}ch2 = 0.120 {\textpm} 0.001, baryon density {\textohm}bh2 = 0.0224 {\textpm} 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 {\textpm} 0.004, and optical depth {$\tau$} = 0.054 {\textpm} 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100{\texttheta}* = 1.0411 {\textpm} 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 {\textpm} 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter {\textohm}m = 0.315 {\textpm} 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude {$\sigma$}8 = 0.811 {\textpm} 0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 {\textpm} 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to {$\sum$}m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base {$\Lambda$}CDM at over 2{$\sigma$}, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the {$\Lambda$}CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, {\textohm}K = 0.001 {\textpm} 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 {\textpm} 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {$<$} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-{$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-{$\Lambda$}CDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6{$\sigma$}, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) driven by galactic tides. We adopt a cosmologically motivated model where dSphs are approximated by a King model embedded within an NFW halo. We find that these NFW-embedded King models are extraordinarily resilient to tides; the stellar density profile still resembles a King model even after losing more than 99\% of the stars. As tides strip the galaxy, the stellar luminosity, velocity dispersion, central surface brightness, and core radius decrease monotonically. Remarkably, we find that the evolution of these parameters is solely controlled by the total amount of mass lost from within the luminous radius. Of all parameters, the core radius is the least affected: after losing 99\% of the stars, Rc decreases by just a factor of {\textasciitilde}2. Interestingly, tides tend to make dSphs more dark matter-dominated because the tightly bound central dark matter "cusp" is more resilient to disruption than the "cored" King profile. We examine whether the extremely large mass-to-light ratios of the newly discovered ultrafaint dSphs might have been caused by tidal stripping of once-brighter systems. Although dSph tidal evolutionary tracks parallel the observed scaling relations in the luminosity-radius plane, they predict too steep a change in velocity dispersion compared with the observational estimates hitherto reported in the literature. The ultrafaint dwarfs are thus unlikely to be the tidal remnants of systems like Fornax, Draco, or Sagittarius. Despite spanning four decades in luminosity, dSphs appear to inhabit halos of comparable peak circular velocity, lending support to scenarios that envision dSphs as able to form only in halos above a certain mass threshold.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive set of convergence tests which explore the role of various numerical parameters on the equilibrium structure of a simulated dark matter halo. We report on results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art, multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the gravitational softening, time-step, force accuracy, initial redshift, and particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the time-step is much shorter than the local orbital time-scale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation time-scale is longer than the age of the Universe. Convergence also requires sufficiently high initial redshift and accurate force computations. Poor spatial, time, or force resolution leads generally to systems with artificially low central density, but may also result in the formation of artificially dense central cusps. We have explored several adaptive time-stepping choices and we have obtained the best results when individual time-steps are chosen according to the local acceleration and the gravitational softening ({$\Delta$}ti{\textasciitilde} ({$\varepsilon$}/ai)1/2), although further experimentation may yield better and more efficient criteria. The most stringent requirement for convergence is typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation criterion. This implies that, in order to estimate accurate circular velocities at radii where the density contrast may reach {\textasciitilde}106, the region must enclose of the order of 3000 particles (or more than a few times 106 within the virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized {$\Lambda$}CDM halo, we find that the spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope shallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, {\textasciitilde}0.005 r200, with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner regions.},

We adopt central velocity dispersions of 9 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Draco and 11 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} for Ursa Minor. Then, for an isotropic stellar velocity distribution, the central DM densities are {$\rho\_$}0D\_ = 0.8 and 1.0 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}, respectively, if visible and dark matter have the same core radius. If DM has a much larger core radius than visible matter but nevertheless dominates the potential, these densities are reduced by a factor of 2. Central DM densities can be lower than this only if the stellar velocity distribution is anisotropic. We use simple two-component King models to investigate this and to look for the smallest DM densities that are consistent with the observations. In both galaxies we show that {$\rho$}0D{$>$}=0.05 M\_sun\_ pc{\textasciicircum}-3{\textasciicircum}. These lower limits are model independent except for the assumption of spherical symmetry. Relaxing this remaining assumption is unlikely to alter the limits. Models with central visible matter densities as large as those of DM are probably just acceptable. In Draco, either the core radii of the luminous and dark matter are similar, or the luminous matter has an anisotropic velocity dispersion, or its dispersion increases with radius.},

  abstract = {We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a "gas" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes "self-similar" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can "bootstrap" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal "seed" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give only very broad limits, unfortunately.

Cross matching with publicly available catalogues of RR Lyrae, we find one RR Lyrae candidate with \$\{\}50\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ astrometric probability outside the limiting radius in each of Sculptor and Fornax, two such candidates in Draco, nine in Ursa Minor, seven in Sextans, and zero in Carina.

Comparing our velocities with previous measurements (Armandroff \& Da Costa 1986) for 15 stars, we show that the V\_r\_ measurements are reliable, and discover two V\_r\_ variable stars with large amplitudes ({$>$}17km/s). These variations are best explained by binary orbital motions. As our sample is likely to contain many additional undetected binaries with smaller velocity amplitudes (due to less favorable orbit inclinations, smaller mass ratios, or longer periods), the observations suggest a large binary fraction in Sculptor, possibly larger than {\textasciitilde}20\% within the period limits {\textasciitilde}0.5 to {\textasciitilde}20yrs. This result is consistent with the recent discoveries of 2-3 large-amplitude variable stars in Ursa Minor and Sextant. Previous kinematic studies of dSph galaxies based on single-epoch measurements are consequently not fully reliable. Radial velocity-variable stars artificially inflate the velocity dispersion and the mass-to-light (M/L) ratio estimates. This weakens the case for dark matter, at least in some of the dSph galaxies. In the case of Sculptor, a velocity dispersion of 6.2+/-1.1km/s and a M/L ratio of 13+/-6(M/L\_V\_)sun\_ are derived from our sample. These results do not provide unambiguous evidence for a dominant dark matter component in Sculptor, mainly because our sample is likely to contain additional undetected V\_r\_ variables of lower amplitude.},

  abstract = {[Abridged]Ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are expected to be the relics of the earliest galaxies forming in the Universe. Observations show the presence of a stellar halo around them, which can give precious insights into the evolution of UFDs. This work investigates how merger properties impact the formation of stellar halos around UFDs, focusing on Tucana II, the most promising UFD assembled through mergers. We develop N-body simulations of isolated mergers between two UFDs with \$1M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ stellar resolution. We build a suite of simulations by varying: i) the merger mass ratio, \$M\_1/M\_2\$, the specific ii) kinetic energy, \$k\$, and iii) angular momentum, \$l\$, iv) the dark-to-stellar mass ratio, \$M\_\{DM\}/M\_*\$, of the progenitors and iv) their stellar size, \$R\_\{1/2\}\$. We use a neural network to explore the parameter space, emulating the properties of the "post-merger" UFD by quantifying the half-mass radius (\$R\_*\$) and the fraction of stars at radii \${$>$}5R\_*\$ (\$f\_5\$). Our principal component analysis clearly shows that \$f\_5\$ (\$R\_*\$) is primarily determined by \$M\_1/M\_2\$ (\$R\_\{1/2\}\$), with \$R\_\{1/2\}\$ (\$M\_1/M\_2\$) playing a secondary role. Both \$f\_5\$ and \$R\_*\$ show almost no dependence on \$k\$, \$l\$, and \$M\_\{DM\}/M\_*\$ in the explored range. Using our emulator, we find that to form the stellar halo observed in Tucana II, i.e. \$f\_5=10{\textbackslash}pm5{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$R\_*=120{\textbackslash}pm30\$pc, we need \$M\_1/M\_2=8\_\{-3\}{\textasciicircum}\{+4\}\$ and \$R\_\{1/2\}=97{\textasciicircum}\{+25\}\_\{-18\}\$pc. Such findings are corroborated by the consistency (\${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2=0.5-2\$) between the stellar density profile observed and those of simulations having \$M\_1/M\_2\$ and \$R\_\{1/2\}\$ close to the emulator's predictions. Ongoing and planned spectroscopic surveys will greatly increase the statistics of observed stars and thus stellar halos in UFDs. By interpreting such observations with our model, we will provide new insights into the assembly history of UFDs and thus on the early galaxy formation process.},

  abstract = {Context. Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can tackle or alleviate small-scale issues within the cosmological standard model {$\Lambda$}CDM, and diverse flavours of SIDM can produce unique astrophysical predictions, resulting in different possible signatures which can be used to test these models with dedicated observations of galaxy clusters. Aims: This work aims to assess the impact of dark matter self-interactions on the properties of galaxy clusters. In particular, the goal is to study the angular dependence of the cross section by testing rare (large angle scattering) and frequent (small angle scattering) SIDM models with velocity-dependent cross sections. Methods: We re-simulated six galaxy cluster zoom-in initial conditions with a dark matter-only run and with full-physics set-up simulations that include a self-consistent treatment of baryon physics. We tested the dark matter-only setup and the full physics setup with the collisionless cold dark matter, rare self-interacting dark matter, and frequent self-interacting dark matter models. We then studied their matter density profiles as well as their subhalo population. Results: Our dark matter-only SIDM simulations agree with theoretical models, and when baryons are included in simulations, our SIDM models substantially increase the central density of galaxy cluster cores compared to full-physics simulations using collisionless dark matter. SIDM subhalo suppression in full-physics simulations is milder compared to the one found in the dark matter-only simulations because of the cuspier baryonic potential that prevents subhalo disruption. Moreover, SIDM with small-angle scattering significantly suppresses a larger number of subhaloes compared to large-angle scattering SIDM models. Additionally, SIDM models generate a broader range of subhalo concentration values, including a tail of more diffuse subhaloes in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and a population of more compact subhaloes in the cluster cores.},

The apparent proper motion of Sgr A* relative to J1745-283 is 6.379+/-0.024 mas yr-1 along a position angle of 209.60d+/-0.18d, almost entirely in the plane of the Galaxy. The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy is -0.4+/-0.9 km s-1. A maximum likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within the observed Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that Sgr A* contains more than about 10\% of the {\textasciitilde}4{\texttimes}106 Msolar deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A*, as measured by several investigators, is less than 1 AU, and the implied mass density of {\textasciitilde}1022 Msolar pc-3 is within about 3 orders of magnitude of a comparable supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative source at the center of a galaxy contains of order 106 Msolar and provides overwhelming evidence that it is in the form of a supermassive black hole. Finally, the existence of ``intermediate-mass'' black holes more massive than {\textasciitilde}104 Msolar between roughly 103 and 105 AU from Sgr A* is excluded.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for studying tracers in gravitational systems where higher moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution are introduced via Virial equations rather than the Jeans equations. Unlike the fourth-order Jeans equations, the fourth-order Virial equations can simply be added to the standard second-order Jeans equation without introducing a new anisotropy parameter {$\beta$}'. We introduce two new global shape parameters {$\zeta$}A and {$\zeta$}B which replace the kurtosis as a more statistically robust measure of the shape of the line-of-sight velocity distribution. We show that in the case of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies these new parameters can significantly reduce the range of density profiles that are otherwise consistent with the observed stellar kinematics (a problem sometimes known as the {$\beta$} degeneracy). Specifically, we find that {$\zeta$}A focuses tightly on a sub-set of solutions where cusped density profiles are degenerate with more concentrated cored dark matter haloes. If the number density of stars {$\nu$}(r) is fixed, then introducing {$\zeta$}B can further reduce the space of solutions by constraining the outer slope of the dark matter density profile. Assuming a Plummer profile for {$\nu$}(r), we recover the surprising result that the dark matter in Sculptor may be cuspy after all, in contrast to the conclusions of other approaches.},

Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} Early Data Release 3 (\emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3) contains astrometry and photometry results for about 1.8 billion sources based on observations collected by the European Space Agency \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} satellite during the first 34 months of its operational phase.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} In this paper, we focus on the photometric content, describing the input data, the algorithms, the processing, and the validation of the results. Particular attention is given to the quality of the data and to a number of features that users may need to take into account to make the best use of the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 catalogue.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The processing broadly followed the same procedure as for \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2, but with significant improvements in several aspects of the blue and red photometer (BP and RP) preprocessing and in the photometric calibration process. In particular, the treatment of the BP and RP background has been updated to include a better estimation of the local background, and the detection of crowding effects has been used to exclude affected data from the calibrations. The photometric calibration models have also been updated to account for flux loss over the whole magnitude range. Significant improvements in the modelling and calibration of the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} point and line spread functions have also helped to reduce a number of instrumental effects that were still present in DR2. \emph{Results. Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 contains 1.806 billion sources with \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}-band photometry and 1.540 billion sources with \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{BP{$<$}sub/{$>$} and \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RP{$<$}sub/{$>$} photometry. The median uncertainty in the \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$}-band photometry, as measured from the standard deviation of the internally calibrated mean photometry for a given source, is 0.2 mmag at magnitude \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} = 10--14, 0.8 mmag at \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 17, and 2.6 mmag at \emph{G{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 19. The significant magnitude term found in the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2 photometry is no longer visible, and overall there are no trends larger than 1 mmag mag\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. Using one passband over the whole colour and magnitude range leaves no systematics above the 1\% level in magnitude in any of the bands, and a larger systematic is present for a very small sample of bright and blue sources. A detailed description of the residual systematic effects is provided. Overall the quality of the calibrated mean photometry in \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} EDR3 is superior with respect to DR2 for all bands.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Using the phat-ELVIS suite of Milky Way-sized halo simulations, we show that subhalo orbital pericentres, rperi, correlate with their dark matter halo structural properties. Specifically, at fixed maximum circular velocity, Vmax, subhaloes with smaller rperi are more concentrated (have smaller rmax values) and have lost more mass, with larger peak circular velocities, Vpeak, prior to infall. These trends provide information that can tighten constraints on the inferred Vmax and Vpeak values for known Milky Way satellites. We illustrate this using published pericentre estimates enabled by Gaia for the nine classical Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellites. The two densest dSph satellites (Draco and Ursa Minor) have relatively small pericentres, and this pushes their inferred rmax and Vmax values lower than they would have been without pericentre information. For Draco, we infer \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} = 23.5 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}pm 3.3\$ km s-1 (compared to \$27.3 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}pm 7.1\$ km s-1 without pericentre information). Such a shift exacerbates the traditional Too Big to Fail problem. Draco's peak circular velocity range prior to infall narrows from Vpeak = 21-51 km s-1 without pericentre information to Vpeak = 25-37 km s-1 with the constraint. Over the full population of classical dwarf spheroidals, we find no correlation between Vpeak and stellar mass today, indicative of a high level of stochasticity in galaxy formation at stellar masses below {\textasciitilde}107 M{$\odot$}. As proper motion measurements for dwarf satellites become more precise, they should enable useful priors on the expected structure and evolution of their host dark matter subhaloes.},

  abstract = {We use a new mass modelling method, GRAVSPHERE, to measure the central dark matter density profile of the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Draco's star formation shut down long ago, making it a prime candidate for hosting a `pristine' dark matter cusp, unaffected by stellar feedback during galaxy formation. We first test GRAVSPHERE on a suite of tidally stripped mock `Draco'-like dwarfs. We show that we are able to correctly infer the dark matter density profile of both cusped and cored mocks within our 95 per cent confidence intervals. While we obtain only a weak inference on the logarithmic slope of these density profiles, we are able to obtain a robust inference of the amplitude of the inner dark matter density at 150 pc, {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc). We show that, combined with constraints on the density profile at larger radii, this is sufficient to distinguish a {$\Lambda$} Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cusp - that has {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc) {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1.8 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{$\odot$} kpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} - from alternative dark matter models that have lower inner densities. We then apply GRAVSPHERE to the real Draco data. We find that Draco has an inner dark matter density of {$\rho$} \_DM(150 pc) = 2.4\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.5\} {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_{$\odot$} kpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}, consistent with a {$\Lambda$}CDM cusp. Using a velocity-independent SIDM model, calibrated on {$\Lambda$}SIDM cosmological simulations, we show that Draco's high central density gives an upper bound on the SIDM cross-section of {$\sigma$}/m {$<$} 0.57 cm2 g-1 at 99 per cent confidence. We conclude that the inner density of nearby dwarf galaxies like Draco provides a new and competitive probe of dark matter models.},

  abstract = {We describe the first results from the Outer Limits Survey, an NOAO survey designed to detect, map, and characterize the extended structure of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The survey consists of deep images of 55 0fdg6 {\texttimes} 0fdg6 fields distributed at distances up to 20{$^\circ$} from the Clouds, with 10 fields at larger distances representing controls for contamination by Galactic foreground stars and background galaxies. The field locations probe the outer structure of both the LMC and SMC, as well as exploring areas defined by the Magellanic Stream, the Leading Arm, and the LMC orbit as recently measured from its proper motion. The images were taken with C, M, R, I, and DDO51 filters on the CTIO Blanco 4 m telescope and Mosaic2 camera, with supporting calibration observations taken at the CTIO 0.9 m telescope. The CRI images reach depths below the oldest main-sequence (MS) turnoffs at the distance of the Clouds, thus yielding numerous probes of structure combined with good ability to measure stellar ages and metallicities. The M and DDO51 images allow for discrimination of LMC and SMC giant stars from foreground dwarfs, allowing us to use giants as additional probes of Cloud structure and populations. From photometry of eight fields located at radii of 7{$^\circ$}-19{$^\circ$} north of the LMC bar, we find MS stars associated with the LMC out to 16{$^\circ$} from the LMC center, while the much rarer giants can only be convincingly detected out to 11{$^\circ$}. In one field, designated as a control, we see the unmistakable signature of the Milky Way (MW) globular cluster NGC 1851, which lies several tidal radii away from the field center. The color-magnitude diagrams show that while at 7{$^\circ$} radius LMC populations as young as 500 Myr are present, at radii gsim11{$^\circ$} only the LMC's underlying old metal-poor ([M/H] {\textasciitilde}-1) population remains, demonstrating the existence of a mean population gradient at these radii. Nevertheless, even at extreme large distances, the dominant age is significantly younger than that of the Galactic globular clusters. The MS star counts follow an exponential decline with distance with a scale length of 1.15 kpc, essentially the same scale length as gleaned for the inner LMC disk from prior studies. While we cannot rule out the existence of undetected tidal features elsewhere in the LMC periphery, the detection of an ordered structure to 12 disk scale lengths is unprecedented and adds to the puzzle of the LMC's interaction history with the SMC and the MW. Our results do not rule out the possible existence of an LMC stellar halo, which we show may only begin to dominate over the disk at still larger radii than where we have detected LMC populations.},

While the light element abundance variations are very common in globular clusters, they are comparatively rare in the Galactic halo field population. However, little is known regarding the occurrence of the abundance anomalies in other environments such as that of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Consequently, we have investigated the anticorrelation and bimodality of CH- and CN-band strengths, which are markers of the abundance variations in GGCs, in the spectra of red giants in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using spectra at the Na D lines, informed by similar spectra for five GGCs (NGC 288, 1851, 6752, 6809, and 7099), we have also searched for any correlation between CN and Na in the Sculptor red giant sample. Our results indicate that variations analogous to those seen in GGCs are not present in our Sculptor sample. Instead, we find a weak positive correlation between CH and CN and no correlation between Na and CN. We also reveal a deficiency in [Na/Fe] for the Sculptor stars relative to the values in GGCs, a result that is consistent with the previous work for dSph galaxies. The outcomes reinforce the apparent need for a high stellar density environment to produce the light element abundance variations.},

Using the MOND value for the mass of the Milky Way, as inferred from the Galactic rotation curve, we derive the tidal radii of Galactic GCs and compare to observed values. Except for Pal 14, the predicted tidal radii of GCs are systematically larger than the observed nominal values. However, the associated uncertainties are so large that tidal radii are consistent on the 1 {$\sigma$} level. We have considered the importance of the Galactic tidal force on the survival of dSphs under MOND. Assuming mass-to-light ratios compatible with a naked stellar population, we found that the present Galactic dSphs preserve their integrity over one Hubble time, except for Sextans, which may survive the tidal interaction only for several Gyr. Mass-to-light ratios as inferred from the internal kinematics of dSph galaxies can be used, but they appear too large to be accounted for only by the stellar population in Willman 1, Coma Berenice, Ursa Minor, Draco, Ursa Major, and possibly Bo{\"o}tes dwarves. Finally, the ability of the Sculptor dwarf to retain the observed population of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is examined. Under the MOND paradigm, we find that the retention fraction in Sculptor is likely not larger than a few percent. Compared to the dark matter scenario, it turns out that MOND makes the retention problem worse. We propose that measurements of the radial velocities of the observed LMXBs in Sculptor could provide a way to distinguish between modified gravities or extended and massive dark matter halos.},

This new phase-space view of our Galaxy demands new tools for comparing observations to simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies in a cosmological context, to test the physics of both dark matter and galaxy formation. We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to generate a suite of synthetic surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project, which feature self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds and thin stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to generate nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by assuming each star particle (of mass 7070 M \textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) represents a single stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust extinction from the simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We provide the complete simulation snapshot at z = 0 for each simulated galaxy. We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades.

These systems are selected to be close analogues to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the most massive satellite of the MW. The simulations allow us to address, in a cosmological context, the impact of the Clouds on the MW, including the contribution of Magellanic satellites to the MW satellite population, and the constraints placed on the Galactic potential by the motion of the LMC. We show that LMC-like satellites are twice more common around Local Group-like primaries than around isolated haloes of similar mass; these satellites come from large turnaround radii and are on highly eccentric orbits whose velocities at first pericentre are comparable with the primary's escape velocity. This implies \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm esc\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm MW\} (50\$ kpc) {\textasciitilde} 365 km s-1, a strong constraint on Galactic potential models. LMC analogues contribute about two satellites with \$M\_* 10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, having thus only a mild impact on the luminous satellite population of their hosts. At first pericentre, LMC-associated satellites are close to the LMC in position and velocity, and are distributed along the LMC's orbital plane. Their orbital angular momenta roughly align with the LMC's, but, interestingly, they may appear to 'counter-rotate' the MW in some cases. These criteria refine earlier estimates of the LMC association of MW satellites: only the SMC, Hydrus1, Car3, Hor1, Tuc4, Ret2, and Phoenix2 are compatible with all criteria. Carina, Grus2, Hor2, and Fornax are less probable associates given their large LMC relative velocity.},

  abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 {$\mu$}m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 {$\mu$}m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 {$\mu$}m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 {$\mu$}m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 {$\mu$}m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 {$\mu$}m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 {$\mu$}m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 {$\mu$}m (95\% confidence). This integrated flux {\textasciitilde}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 {$\mu$}m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

A Bayesian algorithm is used to find new candidate members in the extreme outskirts of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy. Precise metallicities and radial velocities (RVs) for two distant stars are measured from their spectra taken with the Gemini South GMOS spectrograph. The radial velocity, proper motion, and metallicity of these targets are consistent with Sculptor membership. As a result, the known boundary of the Sculptor dwarf extends now out to an elliptical distance of {\textasciitilde}10rh (half-light radii), which corresponds to a projected physical distance of {\textasciitilde}3 kpc. As reported in earlier work, the overall distribution of RVs and metallicities indicate the presence of a more spatially and kinematically dispersed metal-poor population that surrounds the more concentrated and colder metal-rich stars. Sculptor's density profile shows a 'kink' in its logarithmic slope at a projected distance of {\textasciitilde}25 arcmin (620 pc), which we interpret as evidence that Galactic tides have helped to populate the distant outskirts of the dwarf. We discuss further ways to test and validate this tidal interpretation for the origin of these distant stars.},

With data from the literature and APOGEE data release 17, we find the chemical patterns in UMi are consistent with an outside-in star-formation history that includes yields from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type Ia supernovae. Evidence for a knee in the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios near [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -2.1 indicates a low star-formation efficiency similar to that in other dwarf galaxies. Detailed analysis of the surface number density profile shows evidence that UMi's outskirts have been populated by tidal effects, likely as a result of completing multiple orbits around the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {The Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy appears to contain two distinct stellar populations of differing metallicity. Several authors have argued that in order for these two populations to reside in the same gravitational potential, the dark matter halo must have a core similar to that observed in the stellar count profile. This would exclude cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles of the kind predicted for halos and subhalos by dark matter-only simulations of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model. We present a new theoretical framework to analyze observations of stellar count and velocity in a self-consistent manner based on separable models, f(E,J)=g(J)h(E), for the distribution function of an equilibrium spherical system. We use this machinery to analyze available photometric and kinematic data for the two stellar populations in Sculptor. We find, contrary to some previous claims, that the data are consistent with populations in equilibrium within an NFW dark matter potential with structural parameters in the range expected in {$\Lambda$}CDM we find no statistical preference for a potential with a core. Our models allow a maximum circular velocity for Sculptor between 20 and 35 km s-1. We discuss why some previous authors came to a different conclusion.},

  abstract = {Spectra for stars located redward of the fiducial red giant branches (RGBs) of the Ursa Minor and Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been obtained with the Hobby-Eberly telescope and the Marcario Low Resolution Spectrometer. From a comparison of our radial velocities with those reported in previous medium-resolution studies, we find an average difference of 10 km s-1 with a standard deviation of 11 km s-1. On the basis of these radial velocities, we confirm the membership of five stars in Ursa Minor and find two others to be nonmembers. One of the confirmed members is a known carbon star that lies redward of the RGB; three others are previously unidentified carbon stars. The fifth star is a red giant that was found previously by Shetrone and coworkers to have [Fe/H]=-1.68+/-0.11 dex. In Draco, we find eight nonmembers, confirm the membership of one known carbon star, and find two new members. One of these stars is a carbon star, while the other shows no evidence for C2 bands or strong atomic bands, although the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is low. Thus, we find no evidence for a population of stars more metal-rich than [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}=-1.45 dex in either of these galaxies. Indeed, our spectroscopic survey suggests that every candidate suspected of having a metallicity in excess of this value based on its position in the color-magnitude diagram is, in actuality, a carbon star. Based on the census of 13 known carbon stars in these two galaxies, we estimate the carbon star specific frequency to be {$\varepsilon$}dSph{\textasciitilde}=2.4{\texttimes}10-5 L-1V,solar, 25-100 times higher than that of Galactic globular clusters.

In this work, we fit dynamical models to five streams in the Southern Galactic hemisphere, combining observations from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S 5), Gaia EDR3, and the Dark Energy Survey, to measure the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With an ensemble of streams, we find a mass of the LMC ranging from {\textasciitilde}14-19 {\texttimes} 1010 M {$\odot$}, probed over a range of closest approach times and distances. With the most constraining stream (Orphan-Chenab), we measure an LMC mass of \$\{18.8\}\_\{-4.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.5\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , probed at a closest approach time of 310 Myr and a closest approach distance of 25.4 kpc. This mass is compatible with previous measurements, showing that a consistent picture is emerging of the LMC's influence on structures in the Milky Way. Using this sample of streams, we find that the LMC's effect depends on the relative orientation of the stream and LMC at their point of closest approach. To better understand this, we present a simple model based on the impulse approximation and we show that the LMC's effect depends both on the magnitude of the velocity kick imparted to the stream and the direction of this kick.},

I present proper-motion measurements based on Gaia DR2 for 17 ultra-faint dwarf galaxies within 100 kpc of the Milky Way. I compile the spectroscopically confirmed member stars in each dwarf bright enough for Gaia astrometry from the literature, producing member samples ranging from two stars in Triangulum II to 68 stars in Bo{\"o}tes I. From the spectroscopic member catalogs, I estimate the proper motion of each system. I find good agreement with the proper motions derived by the Gaia collaboration for Bo{\"o}tes I and Leo I. The tangential velocities for 14 of the 17 dwarfs are determined to better than 50 km s-1, more than doubling the sample of such measurements for Milky Way satellite galaxies. The orbital pericenters are well constrained, with a mean value of 38 kpc. Only one satellite, Tucana III, is on an orbit passing within 15 kpc of the Galactic center, suggesting that the remaining ultra-faint dwarfs are unlikely to have experienced severe tidal stripping. As a group, the ultra-faint dwarfs are on high-velocity, eccentric, retrograde trajectories, with nearly all of them having space motions exceeding 370 km s-1. A large majority of the objects are currently close to the pericenters of their orbits. In a low-mass (M vir = 0.9 {\texttimes} 1012 M {$\odot$}) Milky Way potential, eight out of the 17 galaxies lack well-defined apocenters and appear likely to be on their first infall, indicating that the Milky Way mass may be larger than previously estimated or that many of the ultra-faint dwarfs are associated with the Magellanic Clouds. The median eccentricity of the ultra-faint dwarf orbits is 0.79, similar to the values seen in numerical simulations but distinct from the rounder orbits of the more luminous dwarf spheroidals.},

Here we report the detection of an ultra-metal-poor star in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy AS0039. With [Fe/H]LTE = -4.11, it is the most metal-poor star discovered in any external galaxy thus far. Contrary to the majority of Milky Way stars at this metallicity, AS0039 is clearly not enhanced in carbon, with [C/Fe]LTE = -0.75, and A(C) = +3.60, making it the lowest detected carbon abundance in any star to date. Furthermore, it lacks {$\alpha$}-element uniformity, having extremely low [Mg/Ca]NLTE = -0.60 and [Mg/Ti]NLTE = -0.86, in stark contrast with the near solar ratios observed in C-normal stars within the Milky Way halo. The unique abundance pattern indicates that AS0039 formed out of material that was predominantly enriched by a {\textasciitilde}20 M{$\odot$} progenitor star with an unusually high explosion energy E = 10 {\texttimes} 1051 erg. Therefore, star AS0039 represents some of the first observational evidence for zero-metallicity hypernovae and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the diverse nature of Population III stars. * Based on observations made with ESO VLT/X-SHOOTER at the La Silla Paranal observatory under program ID 0102.B-0786.},

  abstract = {The Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is old and metal-poor, making it ideal to study the earliest chemical enrichment in the Local Group. We followed up on the most metal-poor star known in this (or any external) galaxy, AS0039, with high-resolution ESO VLT/UVES spectra. Our new analysis confirmed its low metallicity, [Fe/H]LTE = -3.90 {\textpm} 0.15, and that it is extremely C-poor, with A(C) = + 3.60, which corresponds to [C/Fe]LTE = -0.33 {\textpm} 0.17 (accounting for internal mixing). This adds to the evidence of Sculptor being intrinsically C-poor at low [Fe/H] {$\lessequivlnt$} -3. However, here we also report a new discovery of a carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP-no) star in Sculptor, DR20080, with no enhancement of Ba, indicative of enrichment by zero-metallicity low-energy supernovae, ESN {$<$} 1 {\texttimes} 1051. This is the first piece of evidence of a dual population of CEMP-no and C-normal stars in Sculptor at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3. The fraction of CEMP-no stars is still low, fCEMPScl = 9-8+11\% at -4 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3, compared to the significantly higher fraction in the Milky Way halo, fCEMPMW {$\approx$} 40\%. To further investigate the early chemical enrichment of Sculptor, we re-derived chemical abundances of light, {$\alpha$}, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements in all Sculptor stars at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -2.8, with available high-resolution spectra. Our results show that at these low [Fe/H], Sculptor is deficient in light elements (e.g. C, Na, Al, Mg) relative to both the Milky Way halo, and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, pointing towards a significant contribution from high-energy supernovae. Furthermore, the abundance pattern of the star AS0039 is best fitted with a zero-metallicity hypernova progenitor, ESN = 10 {\texttimes} 1051, with a mass of M = 20 M{$\odot$}. Our results in Sculptor, at [Fe/H] {$\leq$} -3, therefore suggest significant enrichment by both very low-energy supernovae and hypernovae, solidifying this galaxy as one of the benchmarks for understanding the energy distribution of the first supernova in the Universe.

Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 was uncovered in the deep, wide-field Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and is consistent with an old ({$\tau$} {$>$} 11 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -2.2) stellar population at a heliocentric distance of {\textasciitilde}10 kpc. Despite its being compact (r h = 3 {\textpm} 1 pc) and composed of few stars, we confirm the reality of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 with Keck II/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy and identify 11 radial velocity members, eight of which have full astrometric data from Gaia and are co-moving based on their proper motions. Based on these 11 radial velocity members, we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion of \$\{3.7\}\_\{-1.0\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\}\$ km s-1 but some caveats preclude this value from being interpreted as a direct indicator of the underlying gravitational potential at this time. Primarily, the exclusion of the largest velocity outlier from the member list drops the velocity dispersion to \$\{1.9\}\_\{-1.1\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.4\}\$ km s-1, and the subsequent removal of an additional outlier star produces an unresolved velocity dispersion. While the presence of binary stars may be inflating the measurement, the possibility of a significant velocity dispersion makes Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 a high-priority candidate for multi-epoch spectroscopic follow-ups to deduce the true nature of this incredibly faint satellite.},

We study the detailed orbital histories of both Draco and Sculptor via numerical orbit integrations. Orbital periods of Draco and Sculptor are found to be 1-2 Gyr and 2-5 Gyr, respectively, accounting for uncertainties in the Milky Way (MW) mass. We also study the influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the orbits of Draco and Sculptor. Overall, the inclusion of the LMC increases the scatter in the orbital results. Based on our calculations, Draco shows a rather wide range of orbital parameters depending on the MW mass and inclusion/exclusion of the LMC, but Sculptor's orbit is very well constrained, with its most recent pericentric approach to the MW being 0.3-0.4 Gyr ago. Our new PMs imply that the orbital trajectories of both Draco and Sculptor are confined within the ``Disk of Satellites,'' better so than implied by earlier PM measurements, and likely rule out the possibility that these two galaxies were accreted together as part of a tightly bound group.},

This yields a data set that spans 19 years, has 14 different epochs of observation, and contains 372 unique red giant branch stars, 196 of which have repeat observations. Using this multi-epoch data set, we constrain the binary fraction for Leo II. We generate a suite of Monte Carlo simulations that test different binary fractions using Bayesian analysis and determine that the binary fraction for Leo II ranges from \{0.30\}-0.10+0.09 to \{0.34\}-0.11+0.11, depending on the distributions of binary orbital parameters assumed. This value is smaller than what has been found for the solar neighborhood ({$\sim$}0.4-0.6) but falls within the wide range of values that have been inferred for other dwarf spheroidals (0.14-0.69). The distribution of orbital periods has the greatest impact on the binary fraction results. If the fraction we find in Leo II is present in low-mass ultra-faints, it can artificially inflate the velocity dispersion of those systems and cause them to appear more dark matter rich than in actuality. For a galaxy with an intrinsic dispersion of 1 km s-1 and an observational sample of 100 stars, the dispersion can be increased by a factor of 1.5-2 for Leo II-like binary fractions or by a factor of three for binary fractions on the higher end of what has been seen in other dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {Measuring the frequency of binary stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) requires data taken over long time intervals. We combine radial velocity measurements from five literature sources taken over the course of {$\sim$}30 years to yield the largest multi-epoch kinematic sample for stars in the dSphs Draco and Ursa Minor. With this data set, we are able to implement an improved version of the Bayesian technique described in Spencer et al. to evaluate the binary fraction of red giant stars in these dwarf galaxies. Assuming Duquennoy \& Mayor period and mass ratio distributions, the binary fractions in Draco and Ursa Minor are \{0.50\}-0.06+0.04 and \{0.78\}-0.08+0.09, respectively. We find that a normal mass ratio distribution is preferred over a flat distribution, and that log-normal period distributions centered on long periods (\{{$\mu$} \}logP\vphantom\{\}{$>$} 3.5) are preferred over distributions centered on short ones. We reanalyzed the binary fractions in Leo II, Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans, and find that there is {$<$}1\% chance that binary fraction is a constant quantity across all seven dwarfs, unless the period distribution varies greatly. This indicates that the binary populations in Milky Way dSphs are not identical in regard to their binary fractions, period distributions, or both. We consider many different properties of the dwarfs (e.g., mass, radius, luminosity, etc.) and find that binary fraction might be larger in dwarfs that formed their stars quickly and/or have high velocity dispersions.},

Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2{\texttimes}107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

We have also simulated a sample of six ultrahighly resolved Milky Way sized haloes, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300000 gravitationally bound subhaloes within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors of up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhaloes with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhaloes within subhaloes, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhaloes than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhaloes than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3 per cent within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1 per cent within the solar circle. The inner density profiles of subhaloes show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fitted by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated haloes are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5kms-1, an extrapolation over some five orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhaloes are more concentrated than field haloes, with a characteristic density that is typically {\textasciitilde}2.6 times larger and increases with decreasing distance from halo centre.},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

We address the problem of these time-scales having been variously estimated in the literature as much shorter than a Hubble time. Using self-consistent two-component (dark matter and stars) models, we explore mechanisms which may yield extended DF time-scales in such systems in order to explain why dwarf galaxies often show GC systems. As a general rule, dark matter and stars both give a comparable contribution to the dynamical drag. By exploring various possibilities for their gravitational make-up, it is shown that these studies help to constrain the parameters of the dark matter haloes in these galaxies, as well as to test alternatives to dark matter. Under the assumption of a dark halo having a central density core with a typical King core radius somewhat larger than the observed stellar core radius, DF time-scales are naturally extended upwards of a Hubble time. Cuspy dark haloes yield time-scales {$\lessequivlnt$}4.5 Gyr, for any dark halo parameters in accordance with observations of stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion in dSph galaxies. We confirm, after a detailed formulation of the DF problem under the alternative hypothesis of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and in the lack of any dark matter, that due to the enhanced dynamical drag of the stars, the DF time-scales in MOND would be extremely short. Taking the well-measured structural parameters of the Fornax dSph and its GC system as a case study, we conclude that requiring DF time-scales comparable to the Hubble time strongly favours dark haloes with a central core.},

Draco is found to contain some stars that are much cooler than the giant-branch tip in M92 while being much more metal-poor than stars in M3. On the average, Draco and Ursa Minor giants reveal a systematic enhancement of the G band of CH relative to globular-cluster stars of comparable metallicities and temperatures; some individual stars, however, show G bands appropriate to their metallicities.

All the other stars observed in the Draco field, among them a UV-bright K giant and a blue suprahorizontal-branch star, together with all the stars observed in Ursa Minor, have velocities consistent with membership. The new radial velocities furnish weak evidence against an internal velocity dispersion as great as 10 km/s in Draco.},

  abstract = {The Milky Way has at least twenty-three known satellite galaxies that shine with luminosities ranging from about a thousand to a billion times that of the Sun. Half of these galaxies were discovered in the past few years in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and they are among the least luminous galaxies in the known Universe. A determination of the mass of these galaxies provides a test of galaxy formation at the smallest scales and probes the nature of the dark matter that dominates the mass density of the Universe. Here we use new measurements of the velocities of the stars in these galaxies to show that they are consistent with them having a common mass of about 107 within their central 300parsecs. This result demonstrates that the faintest of the Milky Way satellites are the most dark-matter-dominated galaxies known, and could be a hint of a new scale in galaxy formation or a characteristic scale for the clustering of dark matter.},

  abstract = {In the past several years high resolution kinematic data sets from Milky Way satellite galaxies have confirmed earlier indications that these systems are dark matter dominated objects. Further understanding of what these galaxies reveal about cosmology and the small scale structure of dark matter relies in large part on a more detailed interpretation of their internal kinematics. This article discusses a likelihood formalism that extracts important quantities from the kinematic data, including the amplitude of rotation, proper motion, and the mass distribution. In the simplest model the projected error on the rotational amplitude is shown to be \${\textbackslash}sim 0.5 \$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$ stars from either classical or ultra-faint satellites. The galaxy Sculptor is analyzed for the presence of a rotational signal; no significant detection of rotation is found, and given this result limits are derived on the Sculptor proper motion. A criteria for model selection is discussed that determines the parameters required to describe the dark matter halo density profiles and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Applied to four data sets with a wide range of velocities, the likelihood is found to be more sensitive to variations in the slope of the dark matter density profile than variations in the velocity anisotropy. Models with variable radial velocity anisotropy are shown to be preferred relative to those in which this quantity is constant at all radii in the galaxy.},

  abstract = {Owing to the recent identification of major substructures in our Milky Way (MW), the astronomical community has started to reevaluate the importance of dissolved and existing dwarf galaxies. In this work, we investigate up to 13 elements in 43 giant stars of the Sculptor dwarf galaxy (Scl) using high-signal-to-noise-ratio near-infrared (NIR) APOGEE spectra. Thanks to the strong feature lines in the NIR, we were able to determine high-resolution O, Si, and Al abundances for a large group of sample stars for the first time in Scl. By comparing the [{$\alpha$}/Fe] (i.e., O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti) of the stars in Scl, Sagittarius, and the MW, we confirm the general trend that less massive galaxies tend to show lower [{$\alpha$}/Fe]. The low [Al/Fe] ({$\sim$} - 0.5) in Scl demonstrates the value of this ratio as a discriminator with which to identify stars born in dwarf galaxies (from MW field stars). A chemical-evolution model suggests that Scl has a top-light initial mass function (IMF), with a high-mass IMF power index of {$\sim$} - 2.7, and a minimum Type Ia supernovae delay time of {$\sim$}100 Myr. Furthermore, a linear regression analysis indicates a negative radial metallicity gradient and positive radial gradients for [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe], in qualitative agreement with the outside-in formation scenario.},

The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VLT, Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of spectroscopy and imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution is the aim of this review.},

We used the ESO Wide Field Imager in conjunction with the Very Large Telescope/FLAMES spectrograph to study the properties of the resolved stellar population of Sculptor out to and beyond the tidal radius. We find that two components are discernible in the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars in our imaging and in the [Fe/H] and vhel distributions for our large sample of spectroscopic measurements. They can be generally described as a ``metal-poor'' component ([Fe/H]{$<$}-1.7) and a ``metal-rich'' component ([Fe/H]{$>$}-1.7). The metal-poor stars are more spatially extended than the metal-rich stars, and they also appear to be kinematically distinct. These results provide insight into the formation processes of small systems in the early universe and the conditions found there. Even this simplest of galaxies appears to have had a surprisingly complex early evolution. Based on FLAMES observations collected at the ESO, proposals 71.B-0641 and 171.B-0588.},

  abstract = {We present a new homogeneous survey of VLT/FLAMES LR8 line-of-sight radial velocities (vlos) for 1604 resolved red giant branch stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. In addition, we provide reliable Ca II triplet metallicities, [Fe/H], for 1339 of these stars. From this combination of new observations (2257 individual spectra) with ESO archival data (2389 spectra), we obtain the largest and most complete sample of vlos and [Fe/H] measurements for individual stars in any dwarf galaxy. Our sample includes VLT/FLAMES LR8 spectra for {$\sim$}55\% of the red giant branch stars at G {$<$} 20 from Gaia DR3, and {$>$} 70\% of the brightest stars, G {$<$} 18.75. Our spectroscopic velocities are combined with Gaia DR3 proper motions and parallax measurements for a new and more precise membership analysis. We look again at the global characteristics of Sculptor, deriving a mean metallicity of {$\langle$}[Fe/H]{$\rangle$} = -1.82 {\textpm} 0.45 and a mean line-of-sight velocity of {$\langle$}vlos{$\rangle$} = + 111.2 {\textpm} 0.25 km s-1. There is a clear metallicity gradient in Sculptor, -0.7deg dex-1, with the most metal-rich population being the most centrally concentrated. Furthermore, the most metal-poor population in Sculptor, [Fe/H]{$<$} - 2.5, appears to show kinematic properties distinct from the rest of the stellar population. Finally, we combine our results with the exquisite Gaia DR3 multi-colour photometry to further investigate the colour-magnitude diagram of the resolved stellar population in Sculptor. Our detailed analysis shows a similar global picture as previous studies, but with much more precise detail, revealing that Sculptor has more complex properties than previously thought. This survey emphasises the role of the stellar spectroscopy technique and this galaxy as a benchmark system for modelling galaxy formation and evolution on small scales.

  abstract = {The stellar abundance pattern of n-capture elements, such as barium, is used as a powerful tool to infer how star formation proceeded in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. It is found that the abundance correlation of barium with iron in stars belonging to dSph galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, i.e., Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor, have a feature similar to the barium-iron correlation in Galactic metal-poor stars. The common feature of these two correlations can be realized by our inhomogeneous chemical evolution model based on the supernova-driven star formation scenario if dSph stars formed from gas with a velocity dispersion of {\textasciitilde}26 km s-1. This velocity dispersion together with the stellar luminosities strongly suggest that dark matter dominated dSph galaxies. The tidal force of the Milky Way links this velocity dispersion with the currently observed value of {$<$}{\textasciitilde}10 km s-1 by stripping the dark matter in dSph galaxies. As a result, the total mass of each dSph galaxy is found to have been originally {\textasciitilde}25 times larger than at present. Our inhomogeneous chemical evolution model succeeds in reproducing the stellar [Fe/H] distribution function observed in Sextans. In this model, supernovae immediately after the end of star formation epoch can expel the remaining gas over the gravitational potential of the dSph galaxy.},

  abstract = {The peculiar velocity of the Local Group of galaxies manifested in the cosmic microwave background dipole is found to decompose into three dominant components. The three components are clearly separated because they arise on distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their influences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at {\textasciitilde}7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small, and we advocate a reference frame with respect to the Local Sheet in preference to the Local Group. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km s-1 and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km s-1, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km s-1 in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into account, particularly that of the Local Void, causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. Concerning the motion of {\textasciitilde}260 km s-1 away from the Local Void, given the velocities expected from gravitational instability theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position. The Local Void is extremely large.},

Numerically the largest contributions come from the luminosity-line width correlation for spirals, the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR), and the related fundamental plane relation for E/S0 systems, but over 1000 distances are contributed by methods that provide more accurate individual distances: Cepheid, tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), surface brightness fluctuation, Type Ia supernova, and several miscellaneous but accurate procedures. Our collaboration is making important contributions to two of these inputs: TRGB and TFR. A large body of new distance material is presented. In addition, an effort is made to ensure that all the contributions, both our own and those from the literature, are on the same scale. Overall, the distances are found to be compatible with a Hubble constant H 0 = 74.4 {\textpm} 3.0 km s-1 Mpc-1.

An emerging picture is that the LMC is a fairly massive companion (10--20\% of the Milky Way mass) and just passed the pericentre of its orbit, likely for the first time. The gravitational perturbation caused by the LMC is manifested at different levels. The most immediate effect is the deflection of orbits of stars, stellar streams, or satellite galaxies passing in the vicinity of the LMC. Less well known but equally important is the displacement (reflex motion) of central regions of the Milky Way about the centre of mass of both galaxies. Since the Milky Way is not a rigid body, this displacement varies with the distance from the LMC, and as a result, the Galaxy is deformed and its outer regions (beyond a few tens kpc) acquire a net velocity with respect to its centre. These phenomena need to be taken into account at the level of precision warranted by current and future observational data, and improvements on the modelling side are also necessary for an adequate interpretation of these data.},

  abstract = {We propose a scenario in which the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is on its second passage around the Milky Way. Using a series of tailored N-body simulations, we demonstrate that such orbits are consistent with current observational constraints on the mass distribution and relative velocity of both galaxies. The previous pericentre passage of the LMC could have occurred 5-10 Gyr ago at a distance {$\greaterequivlnt$} 100 kpc, large enough to retain its current population of satellites. The perturbations of the Milky Way halo induced by the LMC look nearly identical to the first-passage scenario, however, the distribution of LMC debris is considerably broader in the second-passage model. We examine the likelihood of current and past association with the Magellanic system for dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, and find that in addition to 10-11 current LMC satellites, it could have brought a further four to six galaxies that have been lost after the first pericentre passage. In particular, four of the classical dwarfs - Carina, Draco, Fornax, and Ursa Minor - each have an {\textasciitilde}50 per cent probability of once belonging to the Magellanic system, thus providing a possible explanation for the 'plane of satellites' conundrum.},

  abstract = {We assemble a catalogue of candidate Sagittarius stream members with 5D and 6D phase-space information, using astrometric data from Gaia DR2, distances estimated from RR Lyrae stars, and line-of-sight velocities from various spectroscopic surveys. We find a clear misalignment between the stream track and the direction of the reflex-corrected proper motions in the leading arm of the stream, which we interpret as a signature of a time-dependent perturbation of the gravitational potential. A likely cause of this perturbation is the recent passage of the most massive Milky Way satellite - the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We develop novel methods for simulating the Sagittarius stream in the presence of the LMC, using specially tailored N-body simulations and a flexible parametrization of the Milky Way halo density profile. We find that while models without the LMC can fit most stream features rather well, they fail to reproduce the misalignment and overestimate the distance to the leading arm apocentre. On the other hand, models with an LMC mass in the range \$(1.3{\textbackslash}pm 0.3){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ rectify these deficiencies. We demonstrate that the stream can not be modelled adequately in a static Milky Way. Instead, our Galaxy is required to lurch toward the massive in-falling Cloud, giving the Sgr stream its peculiar shape and kinematics. By exploring the parameter space of Milky Way potentials, we determine the enclosed mass within 100 kpc to be \$(5.6{\textbackslash}pm 0.4){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ , and the virial mass to be \$(9.0{\textbackslash}pm 1.3){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ , and find tentative evidence for a radially-varying shape and orientation of the Galactic halo.},

  abstract = {Determination of the mass density profiles of dwarf galaxies (and specifically whether there is a central core or cusp) provides a critical test of both the properties of dark matter (DM) and the physics of cosmological structure formation. The Milky Way nearby classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) provide some of the best dynamical constraints. While large line-of-sight velocity datasets exist (some thousand stars per galaxy), interpretation is hindered by the well-known mass vs. velocity-anisotropy degeneracy of stellar dynamics. This can be resolved with proper motion (PM) measurements that yield 3-D velocity information. This is well beyond the reach of Gaia, given the small velocity dispersions of dSphs and the absence of bright stars. HST is the only observatory that can advance this problem, given its combination of photometric depth, high spatial resolution, and long time baselines. We propose to obtain HST imaging of eight previously imaged fields (four prime plus four parallels) in the nearby Ursa Minor dSph, to obtain high-accuracy PMs for thousands of stars in this galaxy. This unique data set will provide a direct determination of the velocity anisotropy profile. Through detailed dynamical modeling, this will constrain the DM density cusp slope with an uncertainty of only 0.1, allowing us to discriminate at 10-sigma confidence between a core or NFW cusp. The results will give unique constraints on both the nature of DM, and the physical mechanisms that shape DM density profiles in galaxies. The proposed program therefore shows how HST can still be used, after 33 years in orbit, to tackle unanswered fundamental questions in astrophysics.},

  abstract = {We introduce a stellar velocity survey of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, undertaken using the Michigan/MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) at the Magellan/Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. As of 2006 November we have used MMFS to collect 6415 high-resolution (R=20,000-25,000) spectra from 5180 stars in four dwarf spheroidal galaxies: Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans. Spectra sample the range 5140-5180 {\AA}, which includes the prominent magnesium triplet absorption feature. We measure radial velocity (RV) to a median precision of 2.0 km s-1 for stars as faint as V{\textasciitilde}20.5. From the spectra we also are able to measure the strength of iron and magnesium absorption features using spectral indices that correlate with effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical abundance. Measurement of line strength allows us to identify interloping foreground stars independently of velocity and to examine the metallicity distribution among dSph members. Here we present detailed descriptions of MMFS, our target selection and spectroscopic observations, the data reduction procedure, and error analysis. We compare our RV results to previously published measurements for individual stars. In some cases we find evidence for a mild, velocity-dependent offset between the RVs that we measure using the magnesium triplet and previously published RV measurements derived from the infrared calcium triplet. In companion papers we will present the complete data sets and kinematic analyses of these new observations. This paper includes data obtained with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

  abstract = {We develop an algorithm for estimating parameters of a distribution sampled with contamination. We employ a statistical technique known as "expectation maximization" (EM). Given models for both member and contaminant populations, the EM algorithm iteratively evaluates the membership probability of each discrete data point, then uses those probabilities to update parameter estimates for member and contaminant distributions. The EM approach has wide applicability to the analysis of astronomical data. Here we tailor an EM algorithm to operate on spectroscopic samples obtained with the Michigan-MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) as part of our Magellan survey of stellar radial velocities in nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. These samples, to be presented in a companion paper, contain discrete measurements of line-of-sight velocity, projected position, and pseudo-equivalent width of the Mg-triplet feature, for {\textasciitilde}1000-2500 stars per dSph, including some fraction of contamination by foreground Milky Way stars. The EM algorithm uses all of the available data to quantify dSph and contaminant distributions. For distributions (e.g., velocity and Mg-index of dSph stars) assumed to be Gaussian, the EM algorithm returns maximum-likelihood estimates of the mean and variance, as well as the probability that each star is a dSph member. These probabilities can serve as weights in subsequent analyses. Applied to our MMFS data, the EM algorithm identifies more than 5000 stars as probable dSph members. We test the performance of the EM algorithm on simulated data sets that represent a range of sample size, level of contamination, and amount of overlap between dSph and contaminant velocity distributions. The simulations establish that for samples ranging from large (N {\textasciitilde} 3000, characteristic of the MMFS samples) to small (N {\textasciitilde} 30), resembling new samples for extremely faint dSphs), the EM algorithm distinguishes members from contaminants and returns accurate parameter estimates much more reliably than conventional methods of contaminant removal (e.g., sigma clipping).},

  abstract = {We introduce a method for measuring the slopes of mass profiles within dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies directly from stellar spectroscopic data and without adopting a dark matter halo model. Our method combines two recent results: (1) spherically symmetric, equilibrium Jeans models imply that the product of half-light radius and (squared) stellar velocity dispersion provides an estimate of the mass enclosed within the half-light radius of a dSph stellar component, and (2) some dSphs have chemodynamically distinct stellar subcomponents that independently trace the same gravitational potential. We devise a statistical method that uses measurements of stellar positions, velocities, and spectral indices to distinguish two dSph stellar subcomponents and to estimate their individual half-light radii and velocity dispersions. For a dSph with two detected stellar subcomponents, we obtain estimates of masses enclosed at two discrete points in the same mass profile, immediately defining a slope. Applied to published spectroscopic data, our method distinguishes stellar subcomponents in the Fornax and Sculptor dSphs, for which we measure slopes {$\Gamma$} {$\equiv$} {$\Delta$}log M/{$\Delta$}log r = 2.61+0.43 -0.37 and {$\Gamma$} = 2.95+0.51 -0.39, respectively. These values are consistent with "cores" of constant density within the central few hundred parsecs of each galaxy and rule out "cuspy" Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles (dlog M/dlog r {$<$}= 2 at all radii) with a significance {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 96\% and {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 99\%, respectively. Tests with synthetic data indicate that our method tends systematically to overestimate the mass of the inner stellar subcomponent to a greater degree than that of the outer stellar subcomponent, and therefore to underestimate the slope {$\Gamma$} (implying that the stated NFW exclusion levels are conservative).},

We find {$\sim$}30 per cent of subhaloes hosting satellites with present-day stellar mass 106-108 M{$\odot$} experience {$>$}20 per cent stellar mass-loss after infall. Fornax analogues have earlier infall times compared to Sculptor and Leo I analogues. Star formation in Fornax analogues continues for {$\sim$}3-6 Gyr after infall, whereas Sculptor and Leo I analogues stop forming stars {$<$}2-3 Gyr after infall. Fornax analogues typically show more significant stellar mass-loss and exhibit stellar tidal tails, whereas Sculptor and Leo I analogues, which are more deeply embedded in their host dark matter haloes at infall, do not show substantial mass-loss due to tides. When additionally comparing the orbital motion of the host subaloes to the measured proper motion of Fornax, we find the matching more difficult; host subhaloes tend to have pericentres smaller than that measured for Fornax itself. From the kinematic and orbital data, we estimate that Fornax has lost 10-20 per cent of its infall stellar mass. Our best estimate for the surface brightness of a stellar tidal stream associated with Fornax is {$\Sigma$} {$\sim$} 32.6 mag arcsec-2, which may be detectable with deep imaging surveys such as DES and LSST.},

Both the measured total masses within the radial range probed by tracer objects and the extrapolated virial masses are discussed and quoted. We also discuss the role of modern numerical simulations in terms of helping to validate model assumptions, understanding systematic uncertainties and calibrating the measurements. While measurements in the last two decades show a factor of two scatters, recent measurements using Gaia DR2 data are approaching a higher precision. We end with a detailed discussion of future developments in the field, especially as the size and quality of the observational data will increase tremendously with current and future surveys. In such cases, the systematic uncertainties will be dominant and thus will necessitate a much more rigorous testing and characterization of the various mass determination methods.},

  abstract = {The discovery of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in globular clusters (GCs) raises the possibility of long-term retention of BHs within GCs. These BHs influence various astrophysical processes, including merger-driven gravitational waves and the formation of X-ray binaries. They also impact cluster dynamics by heating and creating low-density cores. Previous N-body models suggested that Palomar 5, a low-density GC with long tidal tails, may contain more than 100 BHs. To test this scenario, we conduct N-body simulations of Palomar 5 with primordial binaries to explore the influence of BHs on binary populations and the stellar mass function. Our results show that primordial binaries have minimal effect on the long-term evolution. In dense clusters with BHs, the fraction of wide binaries with periods {$>$}105 d decreases, and the disruption rate is independent of the initial period distribution. Multi-epoch spectroscopic observations of line-of-sight velocity changes can detect most bright binaries with periods below 104 d, significantly improving velocity dispersion measurements. Four BH-MS binaries in the model with BHs suggests their possible detection through the same observation method. Including primordial binaries leads to a flatter inferred mass function because of spatially unresolved binaries, leading to a better match of the observations than models without binaries, particularly in Palomar 5's inner region. Future observations should focus on the cluster velocity dispersion and binaries with periods of 104-105 d in Palomar 5's inner and tail regions to constrain BH existence.},

These dwarfs are expected to have fallen into the Galactic halo less than 3 Gyr ago, and will therefore have undergone no more than one full orbit. Here, we have performed hydrodynamical simulations of this process, assuming that their progenitors are gas-rich, rotation-supported dwarfs. We follow their transformation through interactions with the hot corona and gravitational field of the galaxy. Our dedicated simulations reproduce the structural properties of three dwarf galaxies: Sculptor, Antlia II, and with somewhat a lower accuracy, Crater II. This includes reproducing their large velocity dispersions, which are caused by ram-pressure stripping and Galactic tidal shocks. Differences between dwarfs can be interpreted as due to different orbital paths, as well as to different initial conditions for their progenitor gas and stellar contents. However, we failed to suppress in a single orbit the rotational support of our Sculptor analogue if it is fully dark matter dominated. In addition, we have found that classical dwarf galaxies like Sculptor may have stellar cores sufficiently dense to survive the pericentre passage through adiabatic contraction. On the contrary, our Antlia II and Crater II analogues are tidally stripped, explaining their large sizes, extremely low surface brightnesses, and velocity dispersion. This modelling explains differences between dwarf galaxies by reproducing them as being at different stages of out-of-equilibrium stellar systems.},

  abstract = {The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been remarkably successful in explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it has faced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regions of dark matter halos and the properties of the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy satellites. We review the current observational and theoretical status of these "small-scale controversies." Cosmological simulations that incorporate only gravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and central densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics. The solution could lie in baryonic physics: Recent numerical simulations and analytical models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to efficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive galaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star formation efficiency could explain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host visible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the lowest mass galaxies, where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the small-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark sector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter self-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good agreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational lensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo provide evidence for an abundant population of low-mass subhalos in accord with CDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the next few years.},

  abstract = {We have undertaken a large area ({$>$}3 deg2) survey of the Sculptor dSph using the 1-m Swope telescope. The region surveyed includes roughly 1 deg2 centered on the Sculptor core, with the remaining survey area extending to the east and stretching to almost twice the tidal radius (rt=76.5m) to the northeast and southeast. We have imaged in the Washington M,T2 and DDO51 filters, a combination that allows us to discriminate dwarf and giant stars based on the gravity sensitivity of DDO51. The extended structure of Sculptor can be mapped via those stars selected both as giant stars and as having a combination of M and M-T2 consistent with the red giant branch of Sculptor. We also make use of the areal distribution of blue horizontal branch stars, which delineate the extended structure of Sculptor relatively well in this field at high Galactic latitude. Using the HYDRA spectrograph on the Blanco 4-m, we have obtained more than a dozen radial velocities for candidate Sculptor stars that we have identified well outside (1) the core radius, and (2) the radii explored by previous surveys. A preliminary conclusion from our work so far is that Sculptor does not show as extensive a population of extratidal stars as we have identified in similar work we have conducted around the Carina (Majewski et al. 2000, AJ, 119, 760) and Ursa Minor (Palma et al. 2000, BAAS) dwarf galaxies. Indeed, if a lack of significant extended material around Sculptor is borne out by further study over more area and other position angles, then an interesting correlation begins to emerge: Among four galaxies we have surveyed in this way (Car, UMi, Leo II, and Scl), the relative fraction of the dSph's found outside the nominal tidal radius appears to correlate with the published values of M/L. This may suggest that the derived masses for the dwarf spheroidals may be systematically overestimated to a degree set by the amount of dynamical non-equilibrium in the system.

  abstract = {We explore the spatial distribution of stars in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy over an area of 7.82 deg2, including coverage of the central region but extending mostly south and east of the dSph core. Two methods are used to identify stars that are most likely associated with the dSph, and these filtered samples of stars are used to map its spatial structure. First, following the method of previous contributions in this series, we utilize Washington M, T2+DDO51 photometry to identify red giant branch (RGB) star candidates with approximately the same distance and metallicity as the Sculptor dSph. Second, a prominent blue horizontal branch (BHB) population provides a fairly populous and pure sample of Sculptor stars having broadband colors unlike the bulk of the Galactic field star population. A spectroscopically observed subset of Sculptor candidate stars (147 total stars: {\textasciitilde}5\% of all Sculptor candidates and {\textasciitilde}10\% of Sculptor giant candidates) yields a systemic heliocentric velocity for the system of vhel=110.43+/-0.79 km s-1, in good agreement with previous studies. We also find a global velocity dispersion of {$\sigma$}v=8.8+/-0.6 km s-1, with slight indications of a rise in the velocity dispersion past {\textasciitilde}0.4rlim. These spectra also provide a check on the reliability of our candidate Sculptor giant sample to M{\textasciitilde}19 94\% of the photometrically selected Sculptor giant star candidates with follow-up spectroscopy are found to be kinematically associated with Sculptor, while 4 out of 10 stars outside of our Sculptor giant star selection criteria that we tested spectroscopically appear to be velocity members of Sculptor. These percentages are in agreement with results for an additional 22 Sculptor field stars with radial velocities in the literature. All available velocities show that our methodology for picking Sculptor giants is both reliable and conservative. Thus, these giant star samples should provide a reliable means to explore the structure of the Sculptor dSph. Nevertheless, considerable care has been taken to assess the level of background contamination in our photometric sample to ensure an accurately derived density profile of the Sculptor dSph to large radii. Multiple background assessments verify that we detect a considerable stellar density of Sculptor stars to the limits of our main survey area for both the RGB and BHB candidate samples. While we find that a King profile of limiting radius rlim=79.6 arcmin fits the density profile of Sculptor well to {\textasciitilde}60', beyond this, we identify a ``break'' in the profile and a clearly detected population of Sculptor stars following a {$\Sigma$}{\textasciitilde}r-2 decline to more than 2rlim. This break population must signify either the presence of an extremely broad distribution of bound ``halo stars'' around the Sculptor dSph or the presence of unbound tidal debris. If the latter is true, we determine a fractional mass-loss rate of approximately 0.042 Gyr-1 for the Sculptor dSph. Additional support for the notion that there is tidal disruption comes from the two-dimensional distribution of our Sculptor candidate stars; both the RGB and BHB samples show increasingly elongated isodensity contours with radius that point to an apparent stretching reminiscent of what is seen in models of disrupting satellite galaxies. Finally, we find that RGB stars that are more likely to be metal-poor (based on their color and magnitude) are significantly less centrally concentrated and therefore constitute the primary contributing stellar population to the likely tidally stripped parts of the dSph.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new two-parameter family of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy models. The mass distribution has a Plummer profile and falls like R-4 in projection, in agreement with the star-count data. The first free parameter controls the velocity anisotropy and the second controls the dark matter content. The dark matter distribution can be varied from one extreme of mass-follows-light through a near-isothermal halo with flat rotation curve to the other extreme of an extended dark halo with harmonic core. This family of models is explored analytically in some detail - the distribution functions, the intrinsic moments and the projected moments are all calculated. For the nearby Galactic dSphs, samples of hundreds of discrete radial velocities are becoming available. A technique is developed to extract the anisotropy and dark matter content from such data sets by maximizing the likelihood function of the sample of radial velocities. This is constructed from the distribution function and corrected for observational errors and the effects of binaries. Tests on simulated data sets show that samples of {\textasciitilde}1000 discrete radial velocities are ample to break the degeneracy between mass and anisotropy in the nearby dSphs. Interesting constraints can already be placed on the distribution of the dark matter with samples of {\textasciitilde}160 radial velocities (the size of the present-day data set for Draco). The Space Interferometry Mission or SIM allows very accurate differential astrometry at faint magnitudes. This can be used to measure the internal proper motions of stars in the nearby Galactic dSphs. Our simulations show that {\textasciitilde}100 proper motions are sufficient to demolish the mass-anisotropy degeneracy completely. The target stars in Draco are at magnitudes of V{\textasciitilde}19-20 and the required proper motion accuracy is 3-6{$\mu$}asyr-1. The measurement of the proper motions of a sample of {\textasciitilde}100 stars uncontaminated with binaries will take about 400h of SIM time, or under 2 per cent of the mission lifetime.},

Using MMFS at the Magellan/Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, we have acquired 8855 spectra from 7103 red-giant candidates in these Galactic satellites. We list measurements of each star's line-of-sight velocity (median error {\textpm}2.1 km s-1) and spectral line indices for iron and magnesium absorption features. We use globular cluster spectra to calibrate the indices onto standard [Fe/H] metallicity scales, but comparison of the resulting metallicities with published values suggests that the MMFS indices are best used as indicators of relative, not absolute, metallicity. The empirical distributions of velocity and spectral indices also allow us to quantify the amount of contamination by foreground stars. In a companion paper, we develop an algorithm that evaluates the membership probability for each star, showing that the present MMFS sample contains more than 5000 dSph members, including 774 Carina members, 2483 Fornax members, 1365 Sculptor members, and 441 Sextans members.

  abstract = {Stellar streams are particularly sensitive probes of the mass distribution of galaxies. In this work, we focus on the Helmi Streams, the remnants of an accreted dwarf galaxy orbiting the inner Milky Way. We examine in depth their peculiar dynamical properties, and use these to provide tight constraints on the Galactic potential, and specifically on its dark matter halo in the inner 20 kpc. We extract 6D phase-space information for the Helmi Streams from Gaia DR3, and confirm that the Streams split up into two clumps in angular momentum space, and that these depict different degrees of phase-mixing. To explain these characteristics we explore a range of Galactic potential models with a triaxial NFW halo, further constrained by rotation curve data. We find that a Galactic potential with a mildly triaxial dark matter halo, having \$p=1.013{\textasciicircum}\{+0.006\}\_\{-0.006\}\$, \$q=1.204{\textasciicircum}\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.036\}\$, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{discs\}\}=4.65{\textasciicircum}\{+0.47\}\_\{-0.57\}{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{DM\}\}({$<$} 15 {\textbackslash}text\{kpc\})=1.14{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.10\}{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, is required to form two clumps in angular momentum space over time. Their formation is driven by the fact that the clumps are on different orbital families and close to an orbital resonance. This resonance also explains the different degrees of mixing observed, as well as the presence of a dynamically cold subclump (also known as S2). This first and very precise measurement of the triaxiality of the inner dark matter halo of the Galaxy uniquely reveals the high sensitivity of phase-mixed streams to the exact form of the gravitational potential.},

  abstract = {Low-mass stars, those with main-sequence lifetimes that are of order the age of the Universe, provide unique constraints on the Initial Mass Function (IMF) when they formed. Star counts in systems with simple star-formation histories are particularly straightforward to interpret, and those in old systems allow one to determine the low-mass stellar IMF at large look-back times and thus at high redshift. We present the faint stellar luminosity function (based on optical HST data) in an external galaxy, the Ursa Minor dwarf Spheroidal (dSph). This relatively-nearby (distance 70kpc) companion galaxy to the Milky Way has a stellar population with narrow distributions of age and of metallicity, remarkably similar to that of a classical halo globular cluster such as M92 or M15, i.e. old and metal-poor. Contrasting with globular clusters, the internal velocity dispersion of the Ursa Minor dSph indicates the presence of significant amounts of dark matter. We find that the main sequence stellar luminosity function of the Ursa Minor dSph, and implied IMF, down to 0.4 of a solar mass is indistinguishable from that of the halo globular clusters M92 and M15. Thus the low mass stellar IMF for stars that formed at high redshift is invariant in going from a low-surface-brightness, dark-matter-dominated external galaxy, to a globular cluster within the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {In this work, we employ a multicomponent decomposition model to study the Sextans and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which have distinct evolutionary histories. Sextans exhibits massive stars dominating in the early stages of its evolution and a lower contribution from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). With increasing metallicity, the evolution of massive stars in Sextans shows two turning points, at [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2.8 and [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2.0, indicating episodes of accretion events and galactic winds during its evolution. In the late stages, influenced by galactic winds, the contribution from massive stars ceases, and SNe Ia become the dominant evolutionary process. Sculptor exhibits contributions from the main r-process, early very massive stars, massive stars, SNe Ia, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In its early stages, the contributions from early very massive stars and massive stars are dominant, while the contribution from SNe Ia is low. Around [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -2, the contribution from early very massive stars starts to decline, while the contributions from SNe Ia and massive stars continue to increase. At [Fe/H] {$\sim$} -1.7, the contribution from massive stars gradually decreases and approaches the level of the solar neighborhood, while the contribution from AGB stars continues to rise with increasing metallicity. Both dwarf galaxies exhibit characteristic features of similar initial mass functions, but the Sextans dwarf galaxy exhibits a high-mass cutoff, while the Sculptor dwarf galaxy does not. Additionally, through decomposition, we can analyze the contributions of different astrophysical processes to [{$\alpha$}/Fe] versus [Fe/H], [iron-group/Fe] versus [Fe/H], and [neutron-capture/Fe] versus [Fe/H].},

  abstract = {We present a new discrete chemo-dynamical axisymmetric modelling technique, which we apply to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. The major improvement over previous Jeans models is that realistic chemical distributions are included directly in the dynamical modelling of the discrete data. This avoids loss of information due to spatial binning and eliminates the need for hard cuts to remove contaminants and to separate stars based on their chemical properties. Using a combined likelihood in position, metallicity and kinematics, we find that our models naturally separate Sculptor stars into a metal-rich and a metal-poor population. Allowing for non-spherical symmetry, our approach provides a central slope of the dark matter density of {$\gamma$} = 0.5 {\textpm} 0.3. The metal-rich population is nearly isotropic (with {$\beta$} \_r{\textasciicircum}\{red\} = 0.0{\textpm} 0.1), while the metal-poor population is tangentially anisotropic (with {$\beta$} \_r{\textasciicircum}\{blue\} = -0.2{\textpm} 0.1) around the half-light radius of 0.26 kpc. A weak internal rotation of the metal-rich population is revealed with vmax/{$\sigma$}0 = 0.15 {\textpm} 0.15. We run tests using mock data to show that a discrete data set with {$\sim$}6000 stars is required to distinguish between a core ({$\gamma$} = 0) and cusp ({$\gamma$} = 1), and to constrain the possible internal rotation to better than 1{$\sigma$} confidence with our model. We conclude that our discrete chemo-dynamical modelling technique provides a flexible and powerful tool to robustly constrain the internal dynamics of multiple populations, and the total mass distribution in a stellar system.},
