# Understanding the extended density profiles of dwarf galaxies

A number of recent work has also confirmed the presence of extended, likely non-tidal, density profiles. For example, @chiti+2021; @chiti+2023 spectroscopically confirm members out to $~9 R_h$ in Tucana II.

## Multi-epoch star formation and feedback

The star formation history of dwarf galaxies is typically thought to be *bursty*: a series of discrete episodes of intense star formation separated by periods of quiescence. 

For example, in the simulations of @wheeler+2019, etc., dwarf galaxies exhibit strongly bursty SFHs.

### Multi-component density profiles

A related note is that several dwarf galaxies show evidence for multiple chemodynamical components in their stars. While spectra tend to focus on the inner regions (high probability members), the existence of multiple-component stellar populations in the inner regions of dwarf galaxies hints at a complex star formation history capable of creating the observed profiles.

- @benitez-llambay+2016
- @mercado+2021: formation of metallicity gradients from SFH 
- @revaz+jablonka2018 natural formation of multi-component and gradients from cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxies. Originate from dynamical heating of metal rich population and outside in star formation?
- @el-badry+2016. Feedback drives fluctuations in size + radial migration => population gradients.

Observational evidence:

- @pace+2020
- @fabrizio+2016, @kordopatis+2016 (multi-component in Carina)

# Limitations of simulations

Variations to the potential of the inner disk (exclusion of a bar, spiral arms) should minimally affect our results as no orbit we consider reaches less than ~15 kpc of the MW centre. We exclude the mass evolution of the halo from this analysis. Over $10\,$Gyr, this would be fairly significant (factor of $\sim 2$in MW mass, REF) but since we want to determine the upper limit of tidal effects, it is safe to neglect this.
