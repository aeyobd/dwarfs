Some recent works have also confirmed the presence of extended, likely non-tidal, density profiles. Tucana II is another dwarf with spectroscopic confirmation of outer "halo" stars out to $9R_h$ and inconsistent with a tidal origin [@chiti+2021; @chiti+2023].

Scl's two populations have been revealed through photometry [@tolstoy+2004], kinematics [@battaglia+2008; @tolstoy+2023; @arroyo-polonio+2024], dynamical structure [@breddels+helmi2014], age gradients [@deboer+2011], and chemistry [@kirby+2009 ]. 

Many dwarf galaxies also host multiple chemodynamical stellar populations. Typically, older populations are extended, kinematically hotter, and metal-poor, whereas the younger populations are more compact, colder, and metal-rich. Examples include Carina [@battaglia+2012, @fabrizio+2016, @kordopatis+2016], Fornax [@battaglia+2006, @amorisco+evans2012, @delpino+aparicio+hidalgo2015], Sextans [@battaglia+2011; @cicuendez+battaglia2018; @roederer+2023 ], and Andromeda II [@mcconnachie+arimoto+irwin2007; @ho+2012; @delpino+2017]. Evidence of multiple-populations in dwarf galaxies suggests that effects like galaxy mergers or episodic star formation shape the stellar structure of dwarf galaxies.

**Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM).** SIDM significantly complicates tidal evolution. SIDM halos in isolation are not static---by transferring heat through collisions, these halos first undergo core formation and then core collapse. Besides structural changes, SIDM adds that pressure from the host DM halo can change the structure (e.g. aiding core collapse) or remove material from the inner galaxy (analogous to ram pressure stripping) [e.g., @cartonzeng+2024]. An SIDM halo may be more strongly affected by tides, but the velocity dispersion makes a tidal disruption in SIDM still unlikely. 

**Fuzzy dark matter** can also heat up stars owing to density perturbations in the form of interference fringes [e.g., @el-zant+2020; @duttachowdhury+2023]. Similar to other intrinsic heating methods, this model would likely affect all dwarfs similarly, so we should detect similar halos around similar dwarfs. 

**Dynamical heating of old stars**. In a galaxy, older stars generally have higher random velocities (i.e., kinematically "hotter") than younger stars. In dwarf galaxies, several mechanism may heat stellar components, including supernovae kicks in forming stars,  feedback-driven potential fluctuations [@stinson+2009; @maxwell+2012; @el-badry+2016; @mercado+2021], or heating by dark sub-subhalos [@penarrubia+2025]. Over time, these processes naturally produce a more extended, older stellar population which may mimic a stellar halo. A population gradient similar among similar dwarfs would be a test of dynamical heating as a process. 

**Episodic star formation and feedback.** Dwarf galaxies are thought to experience bursty star formation---i.e., consisting of several episodes of intense star formation separated by periods of quiescence [e.g., @salvadori+ferrara+schneider2008; @valcke+derijcke+dejonghe2008;  @wheeler+2019; @azartash-namin+2024]. Stellar feedback in a dwarf galaxy's shallow potential well drives oscillations in the star formation rate. Alternatively, re-ionization may temporarily suspending star formation [@benitez-llambay+2015]. In many simulations, shrinking gas reservoirs form centrally-concentrated later generations of stars, naturally spawning multiple populations  [@kawata+2006; @revaz+jablonka2018]. If episodic or vigorous star formation helps create stellar halos, then corresponding evidence of bursty star formation histories should be apparent.

Halos have been also been claimed to exist around Bootes I and Hercules, although possibly of tidal origin  [e.g., @roderick+2016; @garling+2018; @longeard+2023; @ou+2024]. 

However, some cosmological simulations have suggested that tidal effects may be ubiquitous. find that a majority of satellites form substantial streams, and not due to resolution effects [see also ]. This result appears to be in tension with ours and many previous works. Some reasons cosmological and idealized simulations may give opposite results could include resolution effects [e.g., @santos-santos+2025], additional perturbations from dark matter substructure, tidal "pre-processing" by other infalling satellites, or the streams may be below detection limits [e.g., @shipp+2023]. More work is needed to understand why streams appear to form more readily in cosmological simulations than is observed in the Milky Way or through idealized simulations.
