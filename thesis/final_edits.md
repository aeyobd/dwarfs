1. Add Muñoz+2018 as example citations for general exponential law.
   1. Added to abstract! **Think about elsewhere**
2. Be careful in introduction about mixing dwarf galaxies in general and Milky Way satellites. (Three classes don't include transition and irregular types)
   1. **Todo: carefully read through**
3. ...
   1. Replace MW with Local Group in "teeming with dwarfs" for consistency
4. Pg. 6 "Dwarf galaxies, which occupy the smallest dark matter haloes" 
   -> "Dwarf galaxies, which occupy the smallest dark matter haloes 
   capable of hosting a luminous component" (to be more precise)
   1. Done 
5. \- Caption Fig. 1.3 "2D exponential stars" : I would suggest to adopt a 
   more precise phrasing
   1. 2D exponential => projected exponential surface brightness profile deprojected into 3D density.
6. \- Footnote 10 : I am not sure this statement is of general validity. I 
   would argue that this depends on several factors (e.g. how rotationally 
   supported the gas and stellar component component are, whether there was 
   significant strong recent star formation which introduces important 
   non-circular motions in the HI gas etc)
7. \- Pg 12: you might consider quoting also Gaia collaboration, Helmi et 
   al. (2018), Simon (2018) and Fritz et al. (2018) when discussing the 
   first systematic and precise determinations of Milky Way satellites 
   proper motions
   1. Done!
8. Perhaps I missed it, but in the main text I didn't find a description 
   on how the final velocity dispersion of the simulated dwarfs was 
   calculated (were you using all the particles within 1kpc? Only the bound 
   ones?)
   1. Added a sentence in the results section.
9. This does not need to be included, but I wanted to point you to an 
   article from an ex-PhD student (Cicuendez & Battaglia 2018) where we 
   found quite some peculiarities in Sextans.
   1. Added sentence to discussion about suspected mergers



1. Added citation (Muñoz et al., 2018) to abstract. 
2. Reframe luminosity classification into morphology (dIrr vs dSph and classical vs ultra-faint)
3. Replace MW with Local Group when discussing aboundance of dwarf galaxies
4. "Dwarf galaxies, which occupy the smallest dark matter haloes" 
   -> "Dwarf galaxies, which occupy the smallest dark matter haloes 
   capable of hosting a luminous component" (to be more precise)
5. 2D exponential => projected exponential surface brightness profile (deprojected into 3D density). In Caption Fig. 1.3 for precision.
6. Remove footnote 10 (since Giuseppina points out this is not necessarily generally true)
7. Added Helmi et al. (2018), Simon (2018) and Fritz et al. (2018) when discussing the first systematic and precise determinations of Milky Way satellites proper motions.
8. Added a sentence in the results section to clarify how velocity dispersion of models is calculated.
9. Added Cicuendez & Battaglia (2018) when discussing galaxies possibly having undergone past mergers. 
10. Added Giuseppina to acknowledgements
