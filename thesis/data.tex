An ongoing research question is whether local dwarf spheroidal galaxies
contain substructure such as stellar halos. Some systems appear to be
simple in structure, yet recent work has reported detection of stellar
halos in several classical dwarfs. To provide an empirical benchmark for
simulations in the next chapters, we examine the observed stellar
structure of Sculptor and Ursa Minor. We describe the
\citet{jensen+2024} Bayesian methodology to select high-probability
member stars from \emph{Gaia}. The derived density profiles are robust
to alternative selection criteria. While Fornax is well represented by
an exponential density profile, we find that Sculptor and Ursa Minor
exhibit an excess of stars in their outer regions relative to an
exponential, with a Plummer profile providing a better fit. In following
chapters, we consider possible physical explanations for these extended
profiles.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Gaia} sample
selection}{Gaia sample selection}}\label{gaia-sample-selection}

The detection of faint features in resolved stellar systems requires
careful consideration of whether a given star belongs to the system.
Without removing contamination from foreground/background features,
faint features may be lost in the noise or be of dubious association
with the system. Historically, background discrimination was performed
by the colour-magnitude diagram alone. Now with \emph{Gaia} data,
stellar parallax and proper motion areavailable as additional membership
indicators. Here, we use the \citet{jensen+2024}'s (hereafter J+24)
membership probabilities for \emph{Gaia} observations. J+24 use a
Bayesian framework incorporating proper motion (PM), colour-magnitude
diagram (CMD), and spatial information to determine the probability that
a given star belongs to the satellite or background. By accounting for
PM in particular, J+24 produces low contamination samples of candidate
member stars out to large distances from a dwarf galaxy. J+24 extends
the algorithm presented in \citet{MV2020a}; \citet{MV2020b} by
additionally includes a secondary, extended spatial component. J+24 are
able to find candidate members out to \textasciitilde10 half-light radii
(\(R_h\)). Similar recent work has also included \citet{pace+li2019};
\citet{battaglia+2022}; \citet{pace+erkal+li2022}; \citet{qi+2022}.

J+24 construct likelihoods, \({\cal L}\), representing the probability
density that a star is consistent with either the stellar
foreground/background, \({\cal L}_{\rm bg}\), or the satellite galaxy,
\({\cal L}_{\rm sat}\). In either case, the likelihoods are the product
of a spatial, PM, and CMD components, \begin{equation}{
{\cal L} = {\cal L}_{\rm space}\ {\cal L}_{\rm PM}\ {\cal L}_{\rm CMD}.
}\end{equation}

The spatial likelihood is specified either as a 1 or 2 component
elliptical exponential density profile (with the 2 component used when
shown to be detected). The proper motion likelihood specifies if a
star's proper motion is consistent with the dwarf galaxy's systemic
motion, accounting for observational uncertainties. Finally, the CMD
likelihood is based on the consistency of a star with theoretical
isochrones in \emph{Gaia} \(G\) versus \(G_{\rm BP}- G_{\rm RP}\) for
the galaxy. The background likelihood is a uniform distribution over the
field, and the background CMD and PM likelihoods are constructed
empirically from the stars in an annulus surrounding the dwarf galaxy.
Each likelihood is normalized over the respective parameter space.

The total likelihood is the sum of the background and satellite
likelihoods, weighted by the fraction of stars in the field belonging to
the satellite \(f_{\rm sat}\): \begin{equation}{
{\cal L}_{\rm tot} = f_{\rm sat}{\cal L}_{\rm sat} + (1-f_{\rm sat}){\cal L}_{\rm bg}.
}\end{equation} The probability that any star belongs to the satellite
is then given by \begin{equation}{
P_{\rm sat} = 
\frac{f_{\rm sat}\,{\cal L}_{\rm sat}}{{\cal L}_{\rm tot}}
= \frac{f_{\rm sat}{\cal L}_{\rm sat}}{f_{\rm sat}{\cal L}_{\rm sat} + (1-f_{\rm sat}){\cal L}_{\rm bg}}.
}\end{equation}

J+24 run MCMC simulations to solve for the proper motions,
\(f_{\rm sat}\), and structural properties of the second exponential
density profile (if included). The median parameter are then used to
calculate \(P_{\rm sat}\) which we use to select our samples of likely
member stars.

For our fiducial sample, we adopt a probability cut of
\(P_{\rm sat} = 0.2\). Most stars are assigned probabilities close to
either 0 or 1, so the choice of probability threshold is only marginally
significant. Additionally, even for a probability cut of 0.2, the purity
of the resulting sample with RV measurements is very high
(\textasciitilde90\%, J+24). Note there is likely a systematic bias in
using stars with RV measurements to measure purity. Fainter stars are
less likely to have been targeted and have poorer astrometry and colour
information. We find no difference in the resulting density
distributions when restricting stars to be brighter than a specific
magnitude.

\section{Observed stellar
distributions}\label{observed-stellar-distributions}

In
Figs.~\ref{fig:scl_selection}, \ref{fig:umi_selection}, \ref{fig:fornax_selection},
we illustrate the resulting samples from the algorithm in the tangent
plane, CMD, and proper motion space. The tangent plane coordinates
\(\xi\) and \(\eta\) are the distances in RA and declination as measured
on a plane tangent to the dwarf galaxies centre. \(R_{\rm ell}\) is
defined as the circularized elliptical radius, so
\(R_{\rm ell}^2 = a\,b\,({\xi'}^2 / a^2 + {\eta'}^2 / b^2)\) where
\(\xi'\) and \(\eta'\) are rotated to align with the position angle
direction \(\theta\).

For all galaxies, each criteria is commensurate in sifting out
nonmembers. The CMD is well defined, and probable members only extend a
few times the colour uncertainty from the CMD. In proper motion space,
selected stars are within \(\masyr\) from the systematic proper motion.
The stars furthest away in proper motion space typically have large
uncertainties \(\sim 1\masyr\), so most members are reasonably
consistent. In any case, the algorithm removes stars with inconsistent
PMs. Finally, the spatial likelihood reduces the probabilities of stars
distant from the dwarfs centres. Member stars are rare outside of
\(\sim5R_h\), resulting from both the likelihood specification and the
lower density of background stars consistent with the CMD and PM of the
satellite.

One limitation of the J+24 method is that it assumes a spatial form of
the dwarf galaxy, possibly limiting the detection of very distant stars
or features. Figs.~\ref{fig:scl_selection}, \ref{fig:umi_selection} also
illustrates the distribution of stars selected without a spatial
criterion. We define the \emph{CMD+PM} selection as
\begin{equation}\protect\phantomsection\label{eq:sel_cmd_pm}{
{\cal L}_{\rm CMD,\ sat}\ {\cal L}_{\rm PM,\ sat} > {\cal L}_{\rm CMD,\ bg}\ {\cal L}_{\rm PM,\ bg}
}\end{equation} with the likelihoods from J+24 as described above. These
stars are distributed similar to the fiducial (probable members) sample
but with a background uniform distribution across the entire field. This
illustrates the approximate background of stars which may be confused as
members. Additionally, since there is no clear spatial structure in the
\emph{CMD+PM} (or \emph{all}) sample outside several \(R_h\), it is
unlikely that there are additional faint, tidal features detectable with
\emph{Gaia}.

Finally, we illustrate the location of distant, RV-confirmed members
from Section~\ref{sec:rv_obs} in each panel. These stars illustrate the
extended profiles of each galaxy. Note that for an exponential profile,
99.95\% of stars should be within \(6R_h\), so the discovery of any
stars beyond \(6R_h\) hints at a deviation from an exponential profile.
Distant member stars beg for an explanation as to their origin.

stars.}\label{fig:fornax_selection}

\section{Density profiles}\label{density-profiles}

Density profiles are an essential observational constraint for our later
simulations. To derive density profiles, we use 0.05 dex bins in log
radius. We remove bins at smaller (larger) radii than the first empty
bin working outwards. We use symmetric poisson uncertainties. As
discussed below, these uncertainties are straightforward but are likely
under-representative. We use the values from \citet{munoz+2018}'s Sérsic
maximum likelihood fits for \(R_h\), which are more precisely derived
given their deeper photometry.

Fig.~\ref{fig:scl_observed_profiles} show the derived density profiles
for Sculptor, Ursa Minor, and Fornax. We calculate density profiles for
different selections of stars from above: all quality stars, CMD+PM
only, and the probable member samples. In each case, all samples are the
same towards the inner regions of the satellite. Classical dwarfs
dominate the stellar density in their cores. However, the density
profile \emph{all stars} plateaus at the total background in the field
at radii of 30-60 arcminutes. By restricting stars to being most likely
satellite members by CMD + PM, the background is reduced by 1-2 dex. The
CMD+PM background plateau likely represents the density of background
stars which could be mistaken as members. Finally, the background
(BG)-subtracted profile results from subtracting the apparent background
in the \emph{all} profile.

Note that the probable members (fiducial) density profile continues to
confidently estimate the density profile below the CMD+PM background.
These points are likely unreliable (see discussion below). However,
before this point, both the BG subtracted and probable members density
profiles are strikingly similar. Assumptions about the details of the
likelihood and spatial dependence have marginal influence on the
resulting density profile when the satellite is higher density than the
background. Thus the detection of excesses of stars in Sculptor (past 20
arcmin) and UMi (past 15-20 arcmin) are robust.

Nearby to UMi, there is a small, likely unassociated, ultrafaint star
cluster, Muñoz 1 \citep{munoz+2012}. The cluster is at a relative
position of \((\xi, \eta) \approx(-42, -15)\) arcminutes, corresponding
to an elliptical radius of 36 arcminutes. However this cluster does not
have a bright RGB, so has few stars brighter than a \(G\) mag of 22.
While Muñoz 1 may contribute \(\sim\) 5 stars to the density profile of
UMi, this would possibly only affect 1-2 bins due to its compact size.

To illustrate the differences between each dwarf galaxy, in
Fig.~\ref{fig:classical_dwarfs_densities}, we compare Sculptor, Ursa
Minor, and other classical dwarfs against 2D-exponential and Plummer
density profiles (REF). All dwarf galaxies appear to be well described
by an exponential profile in the inner regions. However, while an
exponential continues to be a good description for other dwarf galaxies,
Sculptor and Ursa Minor diverge, showing a substantial excess over an
exponential, better fit by a Plummer instead. In fact, Sculptor and Ursa
Minor show excesses of between 2-3 orders of magnitude beyond what is
expected of an exponential at the very outer regions!

selects any high quality star, and \emph{BG subtracted} is the
background-subtracted density derived from \emph{all} stars. We mark the
half-light radius (vertical dashed line) and the break radius (black

\(\log R/R_h \sim 0.3\)) compared with other classical
dwarfs.}\label{fig:classical_dwarfs_densities}

\section{Summary}\label{summary}

In summary, we have used J+24 data to derive the density profiles for
the classical dwarf galaxies. In each case, the density profile is
robust against different selection criteria. Both Sculptor and Ursa
Minor show strong evidence for deviations from an exponential profile.
We find no evidence of additional (velocity or stellar) substructure in
either galaxy. Our density profiles are consistent with many previous
works, all indicating divergence from a King or Exponential density
profile with a break between 30 and 60 arcminutes. Our goal in the
following chapters is to test if tides provide a viable explanation for
the observed properties of Sculptor and Ursa Minor.
