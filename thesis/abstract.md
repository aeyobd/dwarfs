Dwarf galaxies are unique cosmological probes, which test our understanding of the smallest scales of structure formation in the Universe. *Among the classical dwarf galaxies, we show that Sculptor and Ursa Minor appear unusual, with more stars than expected in the outer regions compared with the typical Exponential density profile.*^[need to refine this sentence] I verify the validity of this excess, checking @jensen+2024's bayesian membership catalogue for completeness, simple cuts, and other surveys. To evaluate if tides indeed can explain these density features, I conduct idealized N-body simulation of both galaxies in the tidal field of the Milky Way. In both cases, the orbits are well constrained, producing pericenters larger than expected to produce substantial tidal impacts. In addition, the time since the last pericenter does not agree with a tidal interpretation. However, Sculptor's orbit is strongly influenced by the presence of an LMC. With an LMC, Sculptor's long term orbital history is highly uncertain, however recent tidal effects due to the Milky Way and LMC only minimally affect this galaxy. Because tides likely do not explain the presence of these density features, I review other theories about the formation of dwarf galaxy "halos," including mergers / accretion events and complex multi-component star formation histories. The density profiles of Sculptor and Ursa Minor, with their deviations from the classically expected exponential, present an interesting puzzle, likely with a solution involving their formation and history in the early universe.
