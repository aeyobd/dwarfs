In the previous chapters, we have shown that Sculptor and Ursa Minor have more extended density profiles compared to other MW classical satellites, and that recent tides are an unlikely explanation for their extended outer structure. We therefore suggest Scl and UMi host an additional, extended population of stars, such as a "stellar halo." With our data, other classical dwarfs lack evidence for similar extended populations. Thus, Scl and UMi have followed a divergent evolutionary path, motivating our following discussion of extended density formation pathways here.

In this chapter, we compare our results to past work and interpretations. We first review studies considering tidal effects on Scl and UMi and detections of peculiarities.  We then consider possible origins of extended stellar populations in these galaxies. Scenarios include multi-epoch star formation, past mergers depositing stars into the outskirts, and even departures from \LCDM{}. We later discuss how future studies may distinguish formation scenarios. Finally, we summarize the main conclusions of this thesis.

# Comparison with prior work 

## The role of tides

 Tidal effects have long been invoked to explain features of dwarf galaxies [e.g., [@sec:scl_umi_obs_tides], @mayer+2001a; @tsujimoto+shigeyama2002]. Yet, a growing body of work suggests tides may not be as commonplace as suspected. For example, @read+2006 suggested that the absence of rising radial velocity dispersion profiles in dwarfs implies a lack of tidal disruption. @penarrubia+2009, introducing the break radius as a diagnostic (@eq:r_break), showed that most satellite orbits were inconsistent with observable tidal effects. Recently, @pace+erkal+li2022 used a Jacobi radius-based criterion (@eq:r_jacobi) to reach a similar conclusion. Except for the Sagittarius dSph, these results suggest tides have a mild influence on the stellar components of classical dwarfs.

A few studies have modelled Sculptor or Ursa Minor specifically, finding similar conclusions. @iorio+2019 applied idealized N-body simulations to study tidal effects on Scl. They similarly found weak tidal effects, even for a dark-matter-free model. Most recently, @tchiorniy+genina2025 also used idealized simulations tuned to five classical dwarfs with a focus on the inner density, concluding that tides do not strongly affect equilibrium assumptions or the stellar component. 

Our work extends these models, adding updated structural properties, a broader range of orbital histories, and the influence of the LMC. Despite these considerations, we still reach similar conclusions: tidal effects do not shape Scl or UMi's stellar component. A non-tidal process likely underlies the origin of these galaxies' outer density excess. 

## Peculiarities in the galaxies {#sec:peculiarities}

Figure: Density profiles and metallicity gradients in Scl (left) and UMi (right). **Top**: Black points show the J+24 density profiles as a function of elliptical radius, and transparent lines represent the two components of a double-exponential density fit. The vertical lines represent the transition from the inner to the outer exponential profile. **Bottom**: Metallicities as a function of elliptical radius for stars crossmatched against J+24 as described in Appendix -@sec:extra_rv_models. Larger, red stars show the members from \citet{sestito+2023a, sestito+2023b}.

Besides their extended stellar density profiles, Sculptor and Ursa Minor display other peculiarities that may hold clues to their formation. Scl and UMi both host at least two distinct chemodynamic populations, as revealed through their photometric or metallicity-velocity structure[^other_multi_pops] [@tolstoy+2004; @battaglia+2008; @pace+2020]. The inner population is younger, higher metallicity, and dynamically colder, whereas the outer population is older, lower metallicity, and dynamically hotter. 

[^other_multi_pops]: Other examples of galaxies with multiple populations include Carina [@battaglia+2012; @fabrizio+2016; @kordopatis+2016], Fornax [@battaglia+2006; @amorisco+evans2012; @delpino+aparicio+hidalgo2015], Sextans [@battaglia+2011; @cicuendez+battaglia2018; @roederer+2023 ], and Andromeda II [@mcconnachie+arimoto+irwin2007; @ho+2012; @delpino+2017].

Could these internal stellar populations map to the observed density excess? In Scl, both populations have scale radii likely smaller than the half-light radius. However, a third, more tentatively detected population in @arroyo-polonio+2024 would reside within the outer density excess. In Ursa Minor, the transition between the metal-rich and metal-poor stellar components occurs at ${\sim} 30\,$arcmin [@pace+2020], which coincides with our density excess. This metal-poor population may thus be related to the extended stellar density of Ursa Minor. 

@fig:metallicity_gradients shows the radial metallicity distribution in both galaxies. To aid in comparison, we fit a 2-component exponential to the density profiles. We also mark where the densities of each component become equal, the "transition" radius. Scl and UMi both show evidence of a metallicity gradient. But, the relation between the metallicity gradient and the transition from the inner to the outer density profile is unclear. UMi also has few measurements past the transition radius. Further observations would be necessary to understand if the extended stellar component represents a chemically distinct population.

Ursa Minor has also shown evidence for possible inner substructure, such as stellar or kinematic "clumps" [e.g., @olszewski+aaronson1985; @demers+1995; @kleyna+1998;@battinelli+demers1999; @bellazzini+2002]. While one clump was re-detected kinematically in @pace+2014, @munoz+2018 find no evidence of substructure with modern photometry. In any case, the survival of a cold clump depends on the inner structure of the halo, disrupting quickly in halos with substructure or inner density cusps but surviving longer in smooth, cored halos [@kleyna+2003; @lora+2012]. 

The multiple chemical populations and possible inner structure of Sculptor and Ursa Minor may represent the signatures of the unusual assembly histories that produced the dwarfs' extended stellar densities. 

# Forming an extended stellar population {#sec:stellar_halos}

As we disfavour a tidal origin for Scl and UMi's extended density profiles, we now consider six other processes that may form an extended stellar population in these dwarfs. 

**Episodic star formation.** Star formation may quench and reignite, creating successive stellar generations with differing distributions. External star formation triggers include tidal compression [@mayer+2001a; @dong+lin+murray2003], collisions with gaseous filaments [@genina+2019], perturbations from dark halos [@starkenburg+helmi+sales2016], or shocks with the MW corona [@wright+2019]. More common mechanisms, like feedback or reionization-driven quenching, may also form multiple stellar generations [@kawata+2006; @benitez-llambay+2015; @revaz+jablonka2018]. However, such processes would not explain why extended stellar populations appear to be non-universal. If an extended population was formed during a separate star formation event, then the star formation history should contain evidence of a corresponding burst. 

**Major mergers.** Dwarf galaxy mergers may be relatively common [@deason+wetzel+garrison-kimmel2014]. After a merger, stars from the lower-mass galaxy are preferentially dispersed, forming an extended stellar component and population gradient [@benitez-llambay+2016; @deason+2022]. If the galaxies contain gas, the merger can also trigger new star formation, forming a younger population of stars [e.g., @genina+2019]. A few local dwarfs are suspected to have undergone a major merger, including Tucana II, Andromeda II, and Phoenix [@lokas+2014; @fouquet+2017; @tarumi+yoshida+frebel2021; @cardona-barrero+2021; @querci+2025]. A galaxy having undergone a major merger should harbour at least two or three populations with distinct origin.

Just as the Milky Way's halo is likely built from many minor mergers, dwarf galaxies may have built accreted "stellar halos" composed of even fainter satellites [@ricotti+polisensky+cleland2022]. Few examples of dwarf-dwarf accretion are known, but a possible stream around And II or chemical peculiarities around Sextans I may be such instances [@amorisco+evans+vandeven2014; @roederer+2023]. In this scenario, the extended stellar populations would contain chemical signatures from several distinct ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.

**Tidal preprocessing**. Some dwarf galaxies may have been tidally "preprocessed" by a massive satellite like the LMC [e.g., @santistevan+2023; @riley+2024]. Tidal preprocessing redistributes already-present stellar populations and may mimic a stellar halo. Key evidence suggestive of preprocessing may include distant dwarf stars or stellar streams.

**Dark-matter-free dwarfs.** Tidal dwarfs are galaxies that formed in gas-rich tidal streams during the merger of two larger galaxies [e.g., @mirabel+dottori+lutz1992; @bournaud+duc2006]. Without a dark matter halo, tidal dwarfs may be more susceptible to tides, forming extended density profiles and inflating the velocity dispersion [@casas+2012; @yang+2014; @wang+2024a]. 

Similarly, in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), galaxies do not contain dark matter. Instead, the gravitational force law is altered to explain rotation curves. Dwarfs would similarly experience stronger tidal effects in MOND [@mcgaugh+wolf2010; @brada+milgrom2000]. 

In both cases, tides more plausibly produce extended density profiles. However, recovering the observed velocity dispersions often requires ongoing tidal disruption [@mcgaugh+wolf2010; but see also @sanchez-salcedo+hernandez2007]. Current data do not show evidence of such features (see Appendix -@sec:extra_rv_models)---future data would be needed to uncover signs of disruption to support this hypothesis.

**Dynamical heating.** Old stars in dwarf galaxies may be dynamically hotter than younger stars due to processes including stellar feedback [@stinson+2009; @maxwell+2012; @el-badry+2016; @mercado+2021], sub-subhalo interactions  [@penarrubia+2025], or even fuzzy dark matter interference fringes [e.g., @el-zant+2020; @duttachowdhury+2023]. However, most of these processes should operate similarly across dwarf galaxies---extended stellar populations should be more common if these processes are important.

# Disentangling the origin of extended stellar populations

We have reviewed a number of different, possibly concurrent explanations for the formation of extended populations. While we leave the nature of Scl and UMi's extended stellar densities an open question, we can discuss possible clues to different formation scenarios. 

*Precise chemistry*. Chemical abundances, comparing the inner and outer regions, can test if the halo was formed within the dwarf or accreted. If external in origin, chemistry could reveal the properties of any past mergers.

*Detailed kinematics*. For models relying on recent tidal disruption, kinematic disequilibrium features should be visible. These would appear as velocity gradients, increasing velocity dispersions, outward-biased moving stars, or non-phase mixed structures [e.g, @kroupa1997; @read+2006; @sanchez-salcedo+hernandez2007]. In addition, measurements of the ellipticity and anisotropy would help verify or alter our understanding of the mass structure and whether DM-free models may be permissible. 

*Deep photometry* may find or rule out signs of dynamical disequilibrium and tidal tails for tidally susceptible models (e.g., *pre-processing* and *DM-free dwarfs*). In addition, photometry will help constrain the prevalence and nature of extended features in dwarf galaxies.

*Star formation histories* can be derived through photometry or chemistry. Evidence of significant star formation episodes or lack thereof may differentiate scenarios that rely on strong star formation bursts (e.g., *episodic star formation history, induced star formation,* and *gas-rich mergers*).  

Ongoing and future observational surveys will be instrumental for testing dwarf galaxy halo formation. Because dSph stars are usually faint, detailed chemical analysis will rely on medium--high resolution multi-object spectroscopy on large telescopes, such as 4MOST [@skuladottir+2023] or the extremely large telescope [@jagourel+2018]. Mapping the 3D kinematics across a dwarf may require a *Gaia* successor, but ongoing surveys with JWST and HST can derive precise proper motions within select regions of dwarf galaxies, reconstructing internal structure and anisotropies [e.g., @vitral+2025]. Current wide-field photometric surveys by the Rubin Observatory [@ivezic+2019] and *Euclid*  [@euclidcollaboration+2025] will trace even fainter features around dwarf galaxies, possibly finding halos, tidal streams, and unusual stellar populations. Together, these observational programs promise a new window into the detailed structure, evolution, and outskirts of dwarf galaxies. 

The next generation of dwarf simulations will likewise continue to refine our understanding of dwarf galaxy formation. Notable recent simulation projects include EDGE [@agertz+2020] and LYRA [@gutcke+2021], both of which can simulate the cosmological formation of isolated dwarf galaxies while resolving individual (massive) stars. Next steps for simulations include improved realism (e.g., magnetic fields), refining physical models (including feedback and star formation), and improving numerical resolution. With these continuing advances, future simulations may shed light on the viability of extended stellar population formation scenarios and the details of dwarf galaxy assembly.

# Conclusion and outlook

In this thesis, we have investigated the extended, outer density excess of Sculptor and Ursa Minor and its possible tidal origin. We have shown that the density profiles are robust, implying that Scl and UMi contain a true density excess relative to other classical dwarfs. 

We then investigated whether tides are a possible explanation. By modelling each galaxy based on cosmological initial conditions, we showed that tides do not strongly affect either galaxy. The LMC changes the orbital history of Scl and UMi, but tides become even weaker in a combined LMC and MW potential. We conclude that recent tides are unlikely to shape the outer radial distribution of stars in Scl and UMi. 

Finally, we discuss the implications of a non-tidal density excess in Scl and UMi. We review mechanisms ranging from episodic star formation histories, to accretion, to departures from \LCDM{}. Future simulations and observational programs will be able to investigate the nature of dwarfs with ever-increasing detail. Abundant opportunities await to uncover the cosmic origins of dwarf galaxies, the building blocks of galaxies like ours.
