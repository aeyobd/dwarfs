In the previous chapters, we have shown that Sculptor and Ursa Minor have more extended density profiles compared to other MW classical satellites, and that recent tides are an unlikely explanation for such extended density profiles. We therefore suggest that Scl and UMi host a "stellar halo"---an additional, extended population of stars. With our data, other classical dwarfs lack evidence for similar stellar halos. The absence of similar halos in other classical dwarfs suggests Scl and UMi have followed a divergent evolutionary path.

In this chapter, we place our results in context with past work. We review both work considering tidal effects on Scl and UMi and detections of peculiarities.  We then consider possible origins of stellar halos for these galaxies. Scenarios include induced star formation forming multiple populations, past mergers depositing stars into the outskirts, and even departures from the standard dwarf galaxy structure. We later discuss how future observations and simulations may distinguish halo formation scenarios. Finally, we summarize the main conclusions of this thesis.

# Comparison with prior work 

## The role of tides

 Tidal effects have been long invoked to explain features of dwarf galaxies [e.g. @sec:scl_umi_obs_tides; @tsujimoto+shigeyama2002; @mayer+2001a ]. Yet, growing work suggests tides may not be as commonplace as suspected. For example, @read+2006 suggest that the absence of rising radial velocity dispersion profiles in dwarfs implies a lack of tidal disruption. @penarrubia+2009, introducing the break radius as a diagnostic (@eq:r_break), showing that most satellite orbits were inconsistent with observable tidal effects. Recently, @pace+erkal+li2022 use a Jacobi radius-based criterion (@eq:r_jacobi), reaching a similar conclusion. With the exception of the Sagittarius dSph, these results suggest tides have mild influence on the stellar components of classical dwarfs.

A few works have modelled Scl or UMi specifically, finding similar conclusions. @iorio+2019 applied idealized N-body simulations to study tidal effects on Scl. They similarly found weak tidal effects, even for a dark-matter-free model. Most recently, @tchiorniy+genina2025 also use idealized simulations tuned to five classical dwarfs with a focus on the inner density, concluding that tides do not strongly affect equilibrium assumptions or the stellar component. 

Our work extends these models, adding updated structural properties, a broader range of orbital histories, and the influence of the LMC. Despite these considerations, we still reach similar conclusions: tidal effects do not shape Scl or UMi's stellar component. A non-tidal explanation likely underlies the origin of these galaxies' density excess. 

## Peculiarities in the galaxies

In the top panel, we plot the J+24 density profiles as function of elliptical radius in black, and the two components of a double-exponential density fit as curved, transparent lines. The vertical lines represent the transition from the inner to the outer exponential profile. **Bottom**: Metallicies as a function of elliptical radius for stars from @tolstoy+2023; @apogee; and @sestito+2023 (left) and @pace+2020; @apogee; and @sestito+2023b (right)

Besides extended stellar density profiles, Scl and UMi display other peculiarities which may hold clues to their formation. Scl and UMi both hosts at least two chemodynamic populations, as revealed through their photometric or metallicity-velocity structure [@tolstoy+2004; @battaglia+2008; @pace+2020]. The inner, compact population is younger, more metal-rich, and dynamically colder, whereas the outer, extended population older, more metal-poor, and dynamically hotter. 

Could these internal stellar populations map to the observed density excess? In Scl, both populations have scale radii likely smaller than the half-light radius. But, the third, more tentatively detected population in @arroyo-polonio+2024 would reside within the stellar halo. In Ursa Minor, the transition between the metal-rich and metal-poor stellar components occurs at $\sim 30\,$arcmin [@pace2020], consummate with the beginning of the density excess. This metal-poor population may thus be related to the stellar halo of Ursa Minor. Fig:metallicity_gradients shows the radial metallicity distribution in both galaxies. Scl and UMi both show evidence of a metallicity gradient, but the outskirts have few stars. Further observations would be necessary to understand if the stellar halo represents a chemically distinct population.

Ursa Minor has also shown evidence for possible inner substructure such as stellar or kinematic "clumps" [e.g., @olszewski+aaronson1985; @demers+1995; @kleyna+1998;@battinelli+demers1999; @bellazzini+2002]. While one clump was re-detected kinematically in @pace+2014, @munoz+2018 find no evidence of substructure with modern photometry. In any case, the survival of a cold clump depends on the nature of dark matter, disrupting quickly in a \LCDM{} halo [@kleyna+2003; @lora+2012]. 

Given their multiple stellar populations and possible inner substructure, this hints that Scl and UMi's distinct structure today arises from an unusual past. A mechanism forming a stellar halo could also explain multiple populations. 

# Forming a stellar halo {#sec:stellar_halos}

As we disfavour a tidal origin for Scl and UMi's extended density profiles, we now consider alternative processes which may form a stellar halo in these dwarfs. 

**Episodic star formation.** Star formation may quench and reignite, creating successive stellar generations with differing distributions. External star formation triggers include tidal compression [@mayer+2001a; @dong+lin+murray2003], collisions with gaseous filaments [@genina+2019], perturbations from dark halos [@starkenburg+helmi+sales2016], or shocks with the MW corona [@wright+2019]. More common mechanisms, like feedback or reionization-driven quenching, may also form multiple stellar generations [@kawata+2006; @benitez-llambay+2015; @revaz+jablonka2018]. However, such processes would not explain why stellar halo formation may be non-universal. If a stellar halo was formed in an older, induced burst of star formation, then the star formation history should contain evidence of a corresponding burst. 

**Major mergers.** Dwarf galaxy mergers may be relatively common [@deason+wetzel+garrison-kimmel2014]. After a merger, stars from the lower-mass galaxy are preferentially dispersed, forming a stellar halo and population gradient [@benitez-llambay+2016; @deason+2022]. If the galaxies contains gas, the merger can trigger new star formation, forming a younger population of stars [e.g., @genina+2019]. A few local dwarfs are suspected to have undergone a major merger, including Tucana II, Andromeda II, and Phoenix [@lokas+2014; @fouquet+2017; @tarumi+2021; @cardona-barrero+2021; @querci+2025]. A galaxy having undergone a major merger should show evidence of at least two or three  populations from distinct origins.

**Minor mergers / accretion**. Just as the Milky Way's halo is believed to be built from many minor mergers, dwarf galaxies may build stellar halos composed of even fainter satellites [@ricotti+polisensky+cleland2022]. Few examples are known, but a stream around And II may be an instance of dwarf accretion [@amorisco+evans+vandeven2014; @roederer+2023]. In this scenario, the stellar halo's would contain chemical signatures from several distinct ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.

**Tidal preprocessing**. Some dwarf galaxies may have been tidally "preprocessed" by a massive satellite like the LMC [e.g., @santistevan+2023; @riley+2024]. Tidal preprocessing redistributes already-present stellar populations without creating new populations, and may mimic a stellar halo. Key evidence suggesting preprocessing may include distant dwarf stars or stellar streams.

**Dark-matter free dwarfs.** Tidal dwarfs form in gas-rich tidal streams created during the merger of two galaxies [e.g., @mirabel+dottori+lutz1992; @bournaud+duc2006]. Without a dark matter halo, tidal dwarfs may be more susceptible to tides, forming extended density profiles and inflating the velocity dispersion [@casas+2012; @yang+2014; @wang+2024a]. 

Similarly, in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), galaxies do not contain dark matter. Instead the gravitational force law is altered to explain rotation curves. Dwarfs would similarly experience stronger tidal effects in MOND [@mcgaugh+wolf2010; @brada+milgrom2000]. 

In both cases, tides more plausibly produce extended density profiles. However, recovering the observed velocity dispersions often requires ongoing tidal disruption [@mcgaugh+wolf2010; but see also @sanchez-salcedo+hernandez2007]. Current data do not show evidence of such features (see @sec:extra_rv_models), so future data would need to uncover signs of disruption to support this hypothesis.

**Dynamical heating.** Old stars in dwarf galaxies may be hotter than younger stars due to processes including stellar feedback [@stinson+2009; @maxwell+2012; @el-badry+2016; @mercado+2021], sub-subhalo interactions  [@penarrubia+2025], or even fuzzy dark matter interference fringes [e.g., @el-zant+2020; @duttachowdhury+2023]. However, most of these processes should operate similarly across dwarf galaxies---stellar halos should be more common if these processes form substantial halos.

# Disentangling the origin of a stellar halo

We just reviewed a number of different, possibly-concurrent explanations for the formation of a stellar halo. While we leave the nature of Scl and UMi's extended stellar densities an open question, we can discuss possible clues to different formation scenarios. 

*Precise chemistry*. Chemistry, particularly comparing the inner and outer regions, could test if the halo appears to originate from a distinct system than the dwarf. This would test if the halo is a separate chemical population, may reveal the properties of any merged galaxies, or show if the halo is consistent with originating from the same galaxy. 

*Detailed kinematics*. For models relying on recent tidal disruption, kinematic disequilibrium features should be visible. These would appear as velocity gradients, increasing velocity dispersions, outward-biased moving stars, or non-phase mixed structures [e.g, @kroupa1997; @read+2006; @sanchez-salcedo+hernandez2007]. In addition, measurements of the ellipticity and anisotropy would help verify or alter our understanding of the mass structure and if DM-free models may be permissible. 

*Deep photometry* may find or rule out signs of dynamical disequilibrium and tidal tails for tidally susceptible models *(e.g., pre-processing and DM-free dwarfs.)* In addition, photometry will help constrain the prevalence and nature of extended features in dwarf galaxies.

*Star formation histories* can be derived through photometry or chemistry. Evidence of significant star formation episodes or lack thereof may differentiate scenarios which rely on strong star formation bursts (e.g. *episodic star formation history, induced star formation, and gas-rich mergers.*)  

Ongoing and future facilities will be essential for testing dwarf galaxy halo formation. Given the typical faint magnitudes of dSph stars, chemistry is best accessible through multi-object spectroscopic instruments on large telescopes (e.g., 4MOST and extremely large telescopes @skuladottir+2023).  3D internal kinematics of dwarfs may require a successor to *Gaia*. However, using JWST and HST enables precise proper motions for small regions within dwarf galaxies [e.g., @vitral+2025], which may be sufficient to constrain vastly different internal dynamic structures and ongoing tidal disruption. Finally, ongoing photometric surveys by Rubin Observatory [@ivezic+2019] and the Euclid mission [@euclidcollaboration+2025] will probe even fainter features around dwarf galaxies, possibly finding more halos, tidal streams, and improving our understanding of their stellar populations. Altogether, new surveys will likely uncover novel aspects about the inner workings and outer halos of dwarf galaxies. 

The next generation of dwarf simulations are beginning to answer questions and unravel processes in the formation of dwarf galaxies. Notable recent simulation projects include EDGE [@agertz+2020] and LYRA [@gutcke+2021], both of which can simulate the cosmological formation of isolated dwarf galaxies while resolving individual (massive) stars. By including more realism (e.g., black holes, magnetic fields), refining models of poorly understood processes (feedback and star formation), and improving numerical resolution, simulations will continue to explore these processes and refine our understanding of dwarf galaxy formation. 

# Conclusion and outlook

In this thesis, we have investigated the extended, outer density excess of Sculptor and Ursa Minor and its possible tidal origin. We show that the density profiles are robust, implying that Scl and UMi contain a true density excess relative to other classical dwarfs. 

We then investigated if tides are a possible explanation. By modelling each galaxy based on cosmological initial conditions, we showed that tides do not strongly affect either galaxy. The LMC changes the orbital history of Scl and UMi, but tides become even weaker in a combined LMC and MW potential. We conclude that recent tides are unlikely to shape the outer radial distribution of stars in Scl and UMi. 

Finally, we discuss the implications of a non-tidal density excess in Scl and UMi. We review mechanisms ranging from episodic star formation histories, to accretion, to departures from \LCDM{}. While a more precise explanation awaits, upcoming and ongoing surveys will uncover the stellar populations within dwarf galaxies in unprecedented detail. Future work will continue to uncover the cosmic origins of the smallest structures forming building blocks of galaxies like ours.
