Boötes III (Boo3) is an unusual system. Boo3 is one of few MW satellites wish



Boötes III (Boo3) is one of few suspected tidally-disrupting Milky Way satellites, and is among the largest and most diffuse faint dwarf galaxies known. While having a small Milky Way pericentre (<10 kpc), Boo3 remains spare in the literature and has no resolved stream stars reported. Here, we will characterize the tidal disruption of Boo3 with idealized N-body simulations. Specifically, we investigate the impact of Boo3's orbit, the dwarf's initial structure, and the inner MW potential. We then assess the observational characteristics of disruption in Boo3 under each scenario and predict the properties of a possible stellar stream.

## History of the BooIII

Boo III was discovered in @grillmair2009 through matched filter method. 

@carlin+sand2018 present a sample of 15 RV members, first measuring the velocity dispersion,
