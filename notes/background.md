## Data

We use J+24 data, updated PM from the MV 2020a catalogue, etc.

J+24 provide membership probabilities for each Gaia star based on a three component likelihood. 

## Statistical methods 

- using J+24 data, we validate
  - Check that PSAT, magnitude, no-space do not affect density profile shape too significantly
- Our "high quality" members all have > 50 member stars and do not depend too highly on the spatial component, mostly corresponding to the classical dwarfs
- We fit Sérsic profiles to each galaxy
  - The sérsic index, $n$, is a measure of the deviation from an exponential. Exponentials have $n=1$, whereas more extended dwarf galaxies will have higher $n$

## Summary

- Of the classical dwarfs, UMi & Scl stand out statistically, with high $n$ given their luminosity
- Including fainter dwarf galaxies, Boo 3 and Boo 1 appear to also have extended density profiles
  - Deeper data would be required to robustly measure this
